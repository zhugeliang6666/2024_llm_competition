上攻行情如期来临3180为年底第一目标华讯财经11月迎来开门红。呈现放量上攻、个股普涨格局。受美元大幅走低的影响，两市高开后快速上攻至3000点关口，并成功收复10日和5日均线。盘面上看，创业板并没有受首批12亿限售股解禁影响，反而是大幅上涨，这无疑带动了市场人气。永磁、黄金、多晶硅、低碳等概念纷纷大涨，而有色、煤炭板块的强势拉升更是让场外资金大幅进场。与此同时，西藏、内蒙、青海等区域板块也有远强于大盘的表现。受调控政策进一步趋紧的影响，地产再次处于跌幅板前列，而化纤、旅游、电力、水泥、传媒等板块表现亦逊色一些。尾盘，股指在3050关口前整固并成功攻破。至收盘时，两市9成个股上扬，沪指收在3054.05点，大涨2.52%，两市66只个股涨停，无非ST个股跌停，成交量2539亿，比上一交易日大幅增加。消息面上看，今日公布的PMI数据符合市场预期，环比上月再度明显提升。这表明国内制造业在节能减排、地产投资减速、外围经济复苏糟糕等等不利情况下依旧有良好表现，当然维护了市场信心。煤炭板块在原油价格盘整阶段依旧能得以充当领头羊，还在于未来资源价格上涨预期强烈，当然，电力企业的亏损却不能反过来让煤企让利，也是板块得以持续暴涨的重要原因。另外，就钢铁板块而言，虽有强势涨停的包钢、广钢吸引眼球，但还是不能带动该板块三个龙头品种强势反弹，根本原因在于行业进入需求淡季，业绩提升没有太大想象空间。至于印度呼吁禁止该国铁矿石出口，虽一定程度上推动国内进口印度矿石上涨压力，但全球铁矿石市场暂时依旧低迷。行业的最大困境还在于下游需求的疲软。华讯投资认为，短期多头已经占据盘面主动，后期还有惯性上攻动力。股指在2950点附近止跌企稳并再一次站稳5日线，宣告持续多日的回调结束，后期大盘将进一步巩固箱体上沿，并为下一轮反攻蓄势。图形上看，3160-3180区间依旧是上方的最强压力位，而年线位置2890-2900一带有强支撑。日MACD指标来看，放量上攻避免了高位死叉的结局，而周MACD指标来看，DIF已经上穿至0轴以上，且红烛继续变长。影响本周股指运行的消息面在于外围。本周美联储、欧洲央行等发达国家的最新利率政策备受市场关注，另外美联储关于量化宽松政策的具体金额及实施方案也决定了未来一段时间全球流动性的总量。人民币升值和大宗商品价格持续走高的态势近期不会改变，而升幅则影响股指反攻高度。操作上，投资者可积极关注沿5日线上行的强势品种，并适当参与。关注人民币升值受益板块，抗通胀品种，军工为首的重组个股，依旧有强烈补涨要求的二线蓝筹品种。更多资讯和数据点击进入股票频道		正向	The expected offensive market came as scheduled. The first goal at the end of the year was 3180. Huaxun Finance welcomed the opening of the door in November. It presents a pattern of volume expansion and rising stocks. Affected by the sharp decline of the US dollar, the two cities opened high and quickly attacked the 3000 point pass, and successfully recovered the 10 day moving average and the 5 day moving average. On the whole, the GEM was not affected by the release of the first batch of 1.2 billion restricted shares, but it rose sharply, which undoubtedly led to the market popularity. Permanent magnet, gold, polysilicon, low carbon and other concepts have risen sharply, while the strong rise of nonferrous metals and coal sectors has allowed off-site funds to enter the market significantly. At the same time, the regional plates of Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and other regions also have far stronger performance than the market. Affected by the further tightening of the regulation policy, the property again fell at the top of the list, while the performance of the chemical fiber, tourism, power, cement, media and other sectors was less satisfactory. At the end of the trading day, the stock index consolidated and successfully broke through at the 3050 pass. At the close of the market, 90% of the stocks in the two cities rose, and the Shanghai Stock Index closed at 3054.05 points, up 2.52%. 66 stocks in the two cities were suspended, and non ST stocks fell, with a trading volume of 253.9 billion, a substantial increase from the previous trading day. In terms of news, the PMI data announced today is in line with market expectations, and it has risen significantly again compared with last month. This shows that the domestic manufacturing industry still has a good performance under the adverse conditions of energy saving and emission reduction, real estate investment slowdown, poor recovery of the peripheral economy, etc., which of course maintains market confidence. The coal sector can still act as the leader in the stage of crude oil price consolidation, and the strong expectation of future resource price rise is the reason why the sector can continue to soar. In addition, the loss of power enterprises can not let the coal enterprises make profits, which is also an important reason. As for the iron ore export ban called for by India, although it has pushed up the pressure of domestic Indian ore imports to a certain extent, the global iron ore market is still sluggish for the time being. The biggest dilemma of the industry is still the weakness of downstream demand. Huaxun Investment believes that the short-term many heads have taken the initiative, and there is still inertia to attack later. The stock index stopped falling and stabilized around 2950 points, and once again stood firm on the 5th line, announcing the end of the continuous callback for many days. Later, the market will further consolidate the upper box and prepare for the next counterattack. Graphically, the 3160-3180 interval is still the strongest pressure position above, and the year line position of 2890-2900 has strong support. In terms of the daily MACD index, the volume expansion attack avoided the outcome of the high dead fork, while the weekly MACD index showed that the DIF had risen above the 0 axis, and the red candle continued to grow longer. The news that will affect the operation of the stock index this week is that the periphery. This week, the latest interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other developed countries have attracted the attention of the market. In addition, the specific amount and implementation plan of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy will also determine the total global liquidity in the future. The trend of RMB appreciation and the continuous rise of commodity prices will not change in the near future, and the increase will affect the counterattack height of the stock index. In terms of operation, investors can pay close attention to the strong variety of 5 day line going up and participate appropriately. Pay attention to the RMB appreciation benefit sector, anti inflation varieties, and the restructuring stocks led by the military industry, which still have strong requirements for making up the second line of blue chip stocks.

哈马斯誓言将发动第三次起义击溃以色列政权中国网12月28日讯据以色列媒体28日报道，以色列军方27日对加沙地带发动大规模空袭，目前已造成数百人死伤，哈马斯的办公机构和多座营地也遭到严重损毁。哈马斯武装27日晚发表声明，誓言将发动“第三次起义”彻底击溃以色列政权。哈马斯武装在27日晚发布的声明中说，以色列针对巴勒斯坦的平民目标发动类似于恐怖袭击的军事行动，目前已经造成了数百名无辜平民死伤，哈马斯将对以色列实施“地狱式”报复，继续向以色列境内发射火箭弹。这份声明还威胁说，战争已经打响，哈马斯发动“第三次起义”的时机已经来临，哈马斯武装发誓将给予“复国主义者敌人以最致命的打击”，彻底击溃以色列政权，但这次起义“对于巴勒斯坦人民来说却会是和平的”。哈马斯还在声明中呼吁全体巴勒斯坦人民团结起来，勇敢地针对以色列目标以及以色列士兵发动自杀式袭击，以让以色列政权“清楚地感受到我们的反抗决心”。哈马斯武装组织发言人巴尔胡姆27日也要求其下属武装派别对以色列发射远程火箭弹，以报复以军空袭加沙。巴尔胡姆说，以军对加沙的空袭是对全体巴勒斯坦人的犯罪，该组织已要求其下属武装派别卡桑旅对以发射射程更远的火箭弹。此外，加沙地带的其他许多巴武装派别认为，以军当天的袭击是“公然的宣战”，并表示准备对以实施一系列的突袭。就在以军空袭加沙2小时后，加沙的哈马斯武装对以南部内盖夫地区发射30多枚火箭弹和多枚迫击炮弹。其中一枚火箭弹击中内提沃特城镇1民房，造成1名居民死亡，另有3人受伤。卡桑旅目前已经宣布对此次火箭弹袭击事件负责。针对这次空袭行动，以色列军方当天发表声明说，以色列空袭加沙是为报复哈马斯连日来向以境内发射火箭弹，以军打击目标是哈马斯机构。以军将继续对哈马斯采取行动，直至加沙地带武装人员停止针对以色列的袭击行动。以总统佩雷斯在接受媒体采访时表示，以方将采取一切必要措施制止哈马斯等武装组织针对以色列的袭击行动，但以方并不计划再次占领加沙地带。巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯的发言人阿布-鲁代纳当天在约旦河西岸城市拉姆安拉发表声明说，“阿巴斯强烈谴责以色列方面向加沙地带发动的侵略行为，他呼吁以色列政府立即停止对加沙地带的侵略，并呼吁国际社会进行干预。”以色列和以哈马斯为主的加沙各武装派别今年6月达成一项停火协议。停火协议12月19日到期后，哈马斯向以色列境内发射大约百枚火箭弹和迫击炮弹，没有造成以色列人伤亡。以色列先前曾威胁还击，但以色列媒体26日报道说，以军的行动将会有所限制，不会发动大规模袭击。(萧熙)	阿布-鲁代纳,佩雷斯,阿巴斯,巴尔胡姆	负向	"Hamas vows to launch a third uprising to defeat the Israeli regime chinanet, December 28. According to Israeli media reports on the 28th, the Israeli military launched a large-scale air raid on the Gaza Strip on the 27th, which has caused hundreds of casualties. Hamas' office and several camps have also been seriously damaged. Hamas armed forces issued a statement on the evening of the 27th, vowing to launch a ""third uprising"" to completely defeat the Israeli regime. The statement released by Hamas on the evening of the 27th said that Israel launched a military operation similar to a terrorist attack on the civilian targets of Palestine, which has caused hundreds of innocent civilians to die. Hamas will implement ""Hell style"" retaliation to Israel and continue to launch rockets to Israel. The statement also threatened that the war had begun, and the time for Hamas to launch a ""third uprising"" had come. Hamas armed forces vowed to give ""the most致命blow"" to the ""Zionist enemy"", completely defeating the Israeli regime. However, this uprising ""will be peaceful to the Palestinian people"". Hamas also called on all the Palestinian people in the statement to unite and bravely launch suicide attacks on Israeli targets and Israeli soldiers in order to ""make the Israeli regime clearly feel our resistance determination"". Hamas spokesman Barhum also required its subordinate armed factions to launch long-range rockets at Israel on the 27th to retaliate for the Israeli army's air strikes on Gaza. Barhum said that the Israeli army's air strike on Gaza was a crime against all Palestinians, and the organization has required its subordinate armed faction, the Kasim Brigade, to launch rockets with longer range at Israel. In addition, many other Palestinian armed factions in the Gaza Strip believed that the attack by the Israeli army on the same day was an ""open declaration of war"", and said they were ready to carry out a series of raids on Israel. Just two hours after the Israeli army's air raid on Gaza, the Hamas armed forces in Gaza launched more than 30 rockets and several mortar shells at the southern Negev region of Israel. One rocket hit a civilian house in Netivot town, killing one resident and injuring another three. The Kasim Brigade has announced that it is responsible for the rocket attack. In response to the air strike, the Israeli military issued a statement on the same day that the Israeli air strike on Gaza was in retaliation for Hamas' continuous launching of rockets into Israel, and the target of the Israeli military's attack was the Hamas organization. The Israeli army will continue to take action against Hamas until the armed personnel in the Gaza Strip stop their attacks on Israel. President Peres of Israel said in an interview with the media that Israel would take all necessary measures to stop the attack on Israel by Hamas and other armed organizations, but Israel did not plan to re occupy the Gaza Strip. Abbas, the spokesman of President Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority, issued a statement in the West Bank city of Ramallah on the same day, saying, ""Abbas strongly condemned Israel's aggression in the Gaza Strip, and called on the Israeli government to immediately stop its aggression in the Gaza Strip and called on the international community to intervene."" Israel and the Gaza armed factions led by Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement in June this year. After the ceasefire agreement expired on December 19, Hamas launched about a hundred rockets and mortar shells at Israel, causing no casualties to the Israeli people. Israel had previously threatened to retaliate, but the Israeli media reported on the 26th that the Israeli army's actions would be limited and would not launch a large-scale attack. (Xiao Xi)"

经济学家预测：2011大宗商品价格上涨趋势明显中广网北京2月19日消息(记者周晋竹)据经济之声报道，在今天(19日)召开的2011中国宏观经济预测春季年会上，多位经济学家预测，今年大宗商品价格存在上涨趋势，农产品和能源类的价格上行压力尤为明显。由于大宗商品在产业层面的基础性作用，以及在资本市场上可以用作规避价格风险的金融工具，使得大宗商品的价格走向备受关注。澳大利亚力拓公司CEO艾博年认为，铁矿石现货价已接近200美元/吨的历史高位，这是一年前无法预计的，即便如此，由于近两年几乎没有大型新矿山投产，供需矛盾仍然紧张。中国社科院数量经济与技术经济研究所所长汪同三做出了大宗商品在今年看涨的预测。汪同三：大宗商品价格肯定是看涨，不是由我们决定，它是由国际市场决定。现在世界经济总体来说处于缓慢复苏恢复过程中，必然加大对大宗商品需求，造成大宗商品价格上涨。还有一个因素就是美国搞QE2，QE2的政策目标指向是提高价格，以美元计价的国际商品大宗价格的上涨。国际市场上大宗商品价格上涨必然导致我们国内这些价格同时上涨。申银万国证券研究所首席宏观分析师李慧勇则更为详细地指出，今年农产品和原油的价格上行趋势明显：李慧勇：2011年大宗商品结构优明显分化，我个人看好农产品和原油。中国农业银行金融市场研究负责人李刚也对农产品未来上涨幅度表示担忧，此外他还从两个方面解读了大宗商品上涨的原因：李刚：大宗商品我认为是非常特殊的商品，供给弹性少于需求弹性，供给短期内不会增长，但是需求很大。第二它很大程度上取决于它是以美元计价，2011年上半年虽然美国经济在复苏，但是整个美元是小幅走弱的态势，有一个轻微的刺激作用。不过，李刚也指出，影响大宗商品价格波动的原因中，不全都是上行的压力，也还存在消弱的因素，比如中国的政策紧缩：李刚：去年末出台的政策紧缩，当时是期货市场跌幅最大。目前情况来看，今年无论是加息还是提高准备金率，对世界的商品价格影响是消减。	李慧勇,周晋竹,汪同三,艾博年,李刚	正向	Economists predict that the trend of commodity price increase in 2011 is obvious. China Radio Network, Beijing, February 19 (Reporter Zhou Jizhu) According to the report of Economic Voice, at the spring annual meeting of 2011 China macroeconomic forecast held today (19), several economists predicted that commodity prices have a rising trend this year, and agricultural products and energy prices are under increasing pressure. Due to the basic role of commodities at the industrial level and their use as a financial tool to hedge price risks in the capital market, the price trend of commodities has attracted much attention. Alan过年, CEO of Rio Tinto, Australia, believes that the spot price of iron ore has approached the historical high of $200/t, which was unpredictable a year ago. However, due to the fact that there are almost no large new mines in the past two years, the supply and demand矛盾is still tense. Wang Tong, the president of the Institute of Quantitative Economics and Technical Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, made a forecast that the bulk commodities will rise this year. Wang Tong: The bulk commodity prices are definitely going up, not decided by us, but by the international market. Now the world economy is generally in the process of slow recovery, which will inevitably increase the demand for commodities and cause the price of commodities to rise. Another factor is that the United States has launched QE2, and the policy goal of QE2 is to raise prices. The international commodity bulk prices denominated in dollars have risen. The rise of commodity prices in the international market will inevitably lead to the simultaneous rise of these prices in our country. Li Huizhong, the chief macro analyst of Shenwan Hongyuan Securities Research Institute, pointed out in more detail that the prices of agricultural products and crude oil were obviously rising this year: Li Huizhong: In 2011, the structure of bulk commodities was significantly differentiated, and I was optimistic about agricultural products and crude oil. Li Gang, the head of the Financial Market Research Office of China Agricultural Bank, also expressed concern about the future rise of agricultural products. In addition, he interpreted the reasons for the rise of commodities from two aspects: Li Gang: I think commodities are very special commodities, with less supply elasticity than demand elasticity, and supply will not grow in the short term, but demand is very large. Secondly, it depends largely on the fact that it is denominated in dollars. Although the US economy was recovering in the first half of 2011, the dollar as a whole was weakening slightly, which had a slight stimulating effect. However, Li Gang also pointed out that the reasons affecting the fluctuation of commodity prices were not all upward pressure, but there were also weakening factors, such as China's policy tightening: Li Gang: The policy tightening issued at the end of last year was the largest decline in the futures market. At present, whether it is raising interest rates or the reserve requirement ratio, it will reduce the impact on the world commodity prices.

武汉富士康上演抢人大战今年员工规模超5万中新社武汉1月27日电(记者徐金波)兔年春节临近，湖北武汉27日迎来外出务工人员返程高潮，部分业务内迁至武汉园区的富士康趁机发起“抢人大战”，以较为可观的薪酬欲在年后招收3万多名普通工人，从而满足生产用工需求。当天，从中国各地返程的湖北外出务工人员，不断地从武汉、武昌和汉口三大火车站奔涌而出，随即转向附近的宏基、傅家坡、新荣村等公路客运站。在这些大型交通枢纽出入口，武汉富士康的招聘广告吸引了众多返乡的外出务工人员前来咨询、填表。据了解，富士康武汉园区新增岗位主要以基层作业员(普工)为主，只要年满16周岁、具有初中及同等学历，均可报名应聘。新进员工试用期及考核期月收入可达2200元，考核期满后最高可达2800元。其中，数控、电子、机械类中职中专生最受欢迎。富士康科技集团副总裁简宜彬说，2007年4月投资10亿美元的武汉工业园一期工程现已建成投产，园区工人超过2万。随着富士康加快内迁步伐和园区配套设施逐步完善，富士康近期会陆续把原设在深圳和烟台的台式电脑生产线迁来武汉，3到5年内富士康武汉园区的台式电脑年产量将达到6800多万台，约占全球台式电脑年产量的一半。此外，还有一些游戏机生产线也将转移到武汉。今年4月到6月间，有3批新的生产线在富士康武汉产业园投产，急需招收3万多名普通工人。届时，园区的员工规模将超过5万人。(完)	简宜彬,徐金波	正向	"In the Year of the Rabbit, the Spring Festival is approaching. On the 27th, Wuhan, Hubei Province, welcomed the peak return journey of workers. Foxconn, which had some businesses relocated to the Wuhan Park, took the opportunity to launch a ""war of grabbing people"", hoping to recruit more than 30000 ordinary workers after the year to meet the needs of production and employment. On the same day, the returning Hubei workers from all over China kept pouring out from the three major railway stations of Wuhan, Wuchang and Hankou, and then turned to the nearby Hongji, Fuxia Slope, Xingrong Village and other highway passenger stations. At these large transportation hub entrances and exits, the recruitment advertisements of Foxconn Wuhan attracted many returning workers to come for consultation and fill in the application form. It is understood that the new posts in Foxconn Wuhan Park mainly focus on grass-roots workers (general workers). Those who are over 16 years old and have junior high school and equivalent education can apply for the job. The monthly income of new employees during the probation and evaluation period can reach 2200 yuan, and the maximum can reach 2800 yuan after the evaluation period. Among them, the most popular are数控, electronic and mechanical vocational college students. Jian Yibin, vice president of Foxconn Technology Group, said that the first phase of the Wuhan Industrial Park, which invested $1 billion in April 2007, has now been completed and put into production, with more than 20000 workers in the park. As Foxconn accelerates its pace of internal migration and the supporting facilities of the park are gradually improved, Foxconn will continue to relocate the desktop computer production line originally set up in Shenzhen and Yantai to Wuhan in the near future. In 3-5 years, the annual output of desktop computers in the Wuhan Park of Foxconn will reach more than 68 million, accounting for about half of the global annual output of desktop computers. In addition, some game console production lines will also be transferred to Wuhan. In April to June this year, three batches of new production lines were put into operation in Foxconn Wuhan Industrial Park, and 30000 more workers were urgently needed. At that time, the number of employees in the park will exceed 50000. (End)"
联手NVIDIA微软明年推ZunePhone手机微软的胃口可真大，不但要涉足掌机领域，现在又对手机感兴趣了，而且这次还找了个重量级的合作伙伴—NVIDIA。将NVIDIA的超强显卡技术，通过微软的WM平台整合，这样的手机确实令人期待啊。微软是为老手，做事讲究步步为营，不会去打没有把握的仗，这就容易显得拖沓，今年年初曾传闻微软将会插手游戏手机的研发，这样可以理解，X360的表现与PSP有的一拼。随后又有消息，微软很有可能将会在未来不久推出一款ZunePhone。直到近日最新消息，微软一款与NVIDIA合作的产品会在明年2月的3GSM大会上发布，更进一步证实了此前的种种传闻。不过想如苹果一样赚得的盆满钵圆，现在看来所有厂商都有有难度，微软也是如此，不过现在既然联合了NVIDIA公司，手机产品的显示硬件必然有个飞跃，加入更多娱乐操作的环节必然能令这款产品高人一筹。明年的WindowsMobile6.5、7平台会不会用在这款手机上也是人们值得讨论的话题之一。		正向	In conjunction with NVIDIA, Microsoft will launch the ZunePhone mobile phone next year. Microsoft's appetite is really big. It not only wants to get involved in the field of handheld computers, but now it is also interested in mobile phones. This time, it has found a heavyweight partner - NVIDIA. Integrating NVIDIA's super graphics card technology through Microsoft's WM platform, this mobile phone is really promising. Microsoft is an old hand. It is cautious in doing things and will not fight without confidence, which is easy to appear tedious. At the beginning of this year, it was rumored that Microsoft would get involved in the development of game mobile phones. This can be understood. X360's performance is comparable with PSP. Later, there was news that Microsoft is likely to launch a ZunePhone in the near future. Until recently, the latest news was that a product of Microsoft and NVIDIA would be released at the 3GSM conference in February next year, which further confirmed all kinds of rumors before. However, it is difficult for all manufacturers to make a lot of money like Apple. Microsoft is also like this. Now that it has joined NVIDIA, the display hardware of mobile phone products must have a leap, and the addition of more entertainment operations will definitely make this product superior. Whether the WindowsMobile6.5 and 7 platforms will be used on this mobile phone next year is also one of the topics worth discussing.
裸露巨胸靠胸吃饭4个女人(组图)导语：把明星分为实力派、偶像派显然不够科学，因为还有一派是“爆乳派”。全球范围内选取靠胸吃饭女明星供大家欣赏。其中有货真价实三版女郎，也有一时充数的国际巨星，具体是否属于爆乳派请各位自己分析。“假波”林志玲台湾第一名模林志玲为了证明自己胸部的“真材实料”，几乎无所不用其极，出医院报告、抬手现腋下，最近更是让女记者亲手“验胸”，为的就是要打破“假波”传闻，还自己“咪咪”一个公道。其实，林志玲种种举措并不单单是因为她个人名誉的原因，相信更大的理由是为了自己的饭碗。要知道伊人是靠一个丰胸纤体广告走红的，如果连身材都是假的，那么以后还怎么靠“胸”吃饭呢？而在台湾娱乐圈，这种靠“胸”吃饭的女星实在多不胜数。	林志玲	正向	"Four women (picture) Introduction: It is obviously unscientific to divide stars into the strength school and the idol school, because there is also a ""bursting breast school"". Women stars who rely on their breasts for food are selected worldwide for everyone to enjoy. There are three genuine versions of women, and some international superstars are counted for the time being. Please analyze for yourself whether they belong to the burst breast school or not. ""Fake wave"" Lin Zhiling, the top model in Taiwan, almost went to great lengths to prove that her chest was ""real"". She gave a hospital report and lifted her hand to show her armpit. Recently, she even let female journalists ""test their chests"" in person in order to break the rumor of ""fake wave"" and give themselves a fair deal of ""mimi"". In fact, Lin Zhuling's various measures are not just because of her personal reputation. I believe that the greater reason is for her job security. You know, Yiren became popular through a breast enhancing and body building advertisement. If even the figure is fake, how can we rely on ""chest"" for food in the future? In the entertainment industry of Taiwan, there are really countless female stars who rely on ""breasts"" for food."
辽宁队长点评救火外援他不强大却给外线球员底气边强：大号的亚历山大更强大曾和亚历山大做过队友的边强对这位“老朋友”的回归感到兴奋，这不仅是因为亚历山大和他有不错的私交，更是因为现在的亚历山大展现出了比以前更强大的实力。身为队长的边强代表辽宁队队员喊出了自信：“以前球队遭遇了一段困难的时期，但随着双外援的就位，我们还是有信心冲进季后赛的。”身体明显大了一号时隔几年后再次见到老朋友亚历山大，辽宁队队长边强显得很开心：“我记得他在CBA2003-04赛季效力过辽宁队，当时我在队中还是小队员，那时候主教练郭指导和教练接军都还在打球呢，但是当时我和亚历山大的关系就很不错，经常开玩笑。现在他回来，我们都很高兴。”亚历山大给边强的第一感觉就是，他的身体比以前强壮了很多。“我记得当时他比较瘦，身体比较单薄，所以在内线的对抗中比较吃亏。这次他回到辽宁队中，当天训练的时候脱了外套一看，明显比以前大了一号，我想他的力量肯定增强了不少，这点对缺乏内线对抗能力的我们很有帮助。”边强显得有点兴奋。边强的这个预感很快便得到了证实。在随后辽宁队与天津队的比赛中，亚历山大在内线的表现得到了全队的认可。在谈到亚历山大的防守时，边强说：“这场比赛他打得不错，在防守对方外援和保护后场篮板球方面给了我们很大的帮助，他在内线对抗上也进步了不少，水平比之前高多了。”罚篮是大多数中锋的软肋，之前的亚历山大也不例外。而让边强欣喜的是，亚历山大现在的罚篮水平也有了明显的提高，“现在他罚篮比以前准多了，你们是没见过他以前的罚篮，那真是和奥尼尔差不多，但通过这两天的训练，我感觉他比以前强了不少。”外线球员更有底气辽宁队上下对亚历山大在防守端的表现都非常认可，但防守只是亚历山大带给球队帮助的一个方面，作为一名内线中锋球员，他在对阵天津队的比赛中更是送出了5次助攻和2次抢断。对于这方面的表现，边强认为：“他的策应能力很好，现在我们突破进去他能很好地找到接球位置去投篮得分，当背身单打遇到包夹的时候，他也能看到外线的空当给我们创造投篮机会。”尽管谨慎的郭士强认为亚历山大的实力还有待于比赛的进一步检验，但身为球员的边强却切身地体会到了亚历山大带来的变化，“最明显的是，他现在在内线一站，我们外线球员出手时就更果断，因为有篮板球的保证，所以我们更自信了。”在边强看来，现在的亚历山大状态并没有调整到最佳，他完全可以打得更好。“我相信他会打得更好，因为他现在还在倒时差，接下来的比赛，他一定会带给我们更多的惊喜。”边强说道。	郭士强,郭指导,亚历山大,边强,接军,奥尼尔	正向	"The captain of Liaoning team commented on the fire saving foreign aid. He was not strong but gave the outside player the courage to be strong. Bian Qiang, who had played with Alexander, was excited about the return of this ""old friend"", not only because Alexander had a good private relationship with him, but also because the current Alexander had shown greater strength than before. Bian Qiang, as the captain, spoke out for the Liaoning team members with confidence: ""The team suffered a period of difficulties in the past, but with the arrival of the two foreign aids, we still have confidence to rush into the playoffs."" When he saw his old friend Alexander again after several years, the captain of Liaoning team, Bian Qiang, seemed very happy: ""I remember he played for Liaoning team in the 2003-04 season of CBA. At that time, I was a young player in the team, and then head coach Guo Zhongzhi and coach Jiejun were still playing basketball, but my relationship with Alexander was very good at that time, and I often joked. Now that he's back, we're all very happy."" The first impression that Alexander gave Bian Qiang was that his body was much stronger than before. ""I remember he was skinnier at that time, so he was at a disadvantage in the confrontation in the interior. This time, when he returned to the Liaoning team, he took off his coat when he trained on the day, and it was obviously one size larger than before. I think his strength must have been greatly enhanced, which is very helpful to us who lack the ability of internal confrontation."" Bian Qiang seemed a little excited. Bian Qiang's foreboding was quickly confirmed. In the subsequent game between Liaoning team and Tianjin team, Alexander's performance in the interior was recognized by the whole team. Speaking of Alexander's defense, Bian Qiang said: ""He played well in this game, giving us a lot of help in defending against foreign aid from the other side and protecting the backcourt rebound. He has also made a lot of progress in the internal confrontation, and his level is much higher than before."" Free throw is the weakness of most centers, and the previous Alexander was no exception. To Bian Qiang's delight, Alexander's current free throw level has also been significantly improved. ""Now his free throw is much more accurate than before. You haven't seen his free throw before. It's really like Shaquille O'Neal, but through these two days of training, I think he is much stronger than before."" The inside and outside players of Liaoning Team are more confident in their performance at both ends of the court. However, defense is only one aspect of the help Alexander brings to the team. As an insider, he gave five assists and two steals in the game against Tianjin Team. Bian Qiang believes that ""his ability to respond is very good. Now, when we break in, he can find the position to catch the ball to shoot and score. When we encounter double teaming in the backcourt, he can also see the gap in the outside court to create shooting opportunities for us"". Although the cautious Guo Shiqiang believes that Alexander's strength remains to be further tested in the game, Bian Qiang, as a player, has personally experienced the changes brought by Alexander. ""The most obvious thing is that when he stands in the interior now, our outside players are more decisive when they shoot, because we have the guarantee of rebounds, so we are more confident."" In Bian Qiang's view, the current Alexander has not been adjusted to the best state, and he can play better. ""I believe he will play better, because he is still in time difference now, and the next game, he will certainly bring us more surprises."" Bian Qiang said"
体操神童诉体校虐待案再开庭证人翻供引爆4大矛盾昨天下午，少年体操冠军高帅诉先农坛体校“虐待”案再次在宣武法院开庭，先农坛体校6名相关人员出庭为先农坛体校作证。曾称体操队负责人不让教高帅的教练朱辉说，他当时与体操队负责人有矛盾才这样说，“不是真实情况”。高帅曾多次获得少儿、青少年级别全国体操冠军，2006年被选送先农坛体校。今年4月29日，高帅离校出走，之后住进精神病院。高帅起诉先农坛体校，索要15万余元赔偿(本报11月8日、12月8日先后报道)。高帅昨天没有出庭。他母亲韩冬梅一个人坐在原告席上。她将家里的电视和DVD搬到原告席上，准备播放3盘DVD和6盘VCD作为录像和录音的证据。她说，高帅现在精神抑郁的病情加重，有一些暴躁，担心他看了录像会受刺激。根据韩冬梅与先农坛体校的证据，双方主要就高帅是否在先农坛体校遭受殴打与是否经过正常训练进行了质证。韩冬梅出示了朱辉所说过的“杨月山不让他教高帅”的录音。朱辉承认曾经说过，但表示，这是因为他与杨月山有矛盾才说的，“并不是真实的情况。”此案未当庭宣判。焦点1高帅被体罚？之前的庭审中，韩冬梅说，高帅在先农坛体校经常受到殴打和体罚，殴打他的大队员有60多条打人的方法。昨日，双方就此进行了论辩。【高母】别人训练高帅跪着【杨月山】这是练习压脚面韩冬梅当庭播放了一段录像，高帅进入先农坛体校的第一个教练杨月山在指导一个孩子训练，高帅在旁边跪着看，孩子停止训练后，高帅帮着挪器具。韩冬梅说，让高帅跪着就是非人的虐待，不但不给训练，还让搬东西。对此，杨月山说，高帅跪着是在练习压脚面，其他孩子也有这样的动作，并不是虐待他。先农坛体校的律师说，一次光盘不能说明问题，要求韩冬梅拿出全年的录像。“应该你们拿出全年录像！”韩冬梅冲他大喊。庭后，高帅在电话里说，录像中是杨月山让他跪着的。他说压脚面的动作是膝盖与脚尖着地，上身尽力向后躺，而他当时是纯粹地跪着。【高母】大队员有60多条打人方法【杨月山】只是孩子之间打闹韩冬梅说高帅被欺负多次后，学校召开家长座谈会，当时体操队的负责人杨月山和胡秉臣都参加了。学校还要求打人的孩子每人写检查，孩子写出来的检查中，共有60多条打人方法。座谈会上，杨月山把一张写有几十个打人方法的纸条给了其他家长看，但不给韩冬梅看。杨月山否认纸条存在，他说，孩子之间打闹，就是踢一脚，借1块钱的事情，没有几十条打人方法。随后，胡秉臣出庭作证时说，纸条存在，但现在找不到了。焦点2高帅未训练？高帅起诉书中称，他在先农坛体校从未受过训练，教练不教他一个动作。先农坛体校向法庭出具了3名教练的训练计划，称对高帅进行了正常的训练。【高母】教练计划“空白”4个月【校方律师】这是教练笔误高帅的第一个教练杨月山说，他严格按训练计划对高帅进行了训练。去年7月，他将高帅交给了马长森教练，马长森训练后，由朱辉教练带高帅。韩冬梅否认高帅被马长森教过。她说，先农坛体校提供的教练计划中，去年7月至10月是空白的，马长森教练的教练计划上，落款时间是今年的7月至10月。而这个时候，高帅正在安定医院就诊。“这是马长森教练的事。”杨月山说。先农坛体校律师解释，这是马长森教练的笔误。【高母】朱辉曾说“领导要求不教高帅”【朱辉】这不是真实情况高帅的另一名教练朱辉出庭作证说，他接手训练高帅时，高帅的水平要比进入先农坛体校时有所提高。韩冬梅立即放出录音，朱辉在录音中说，高帅当时的水平赶不上进入先农坛的时候，一些基本动作高帅已经不能再做，还说这是教练的问题，学校的责任。录音中，朱辉还说，杨月山和他说，不要教高帅，要教另外一个孩子。法官要求朱辉解释，他说，这些话他确实说过，但只是他的话，不是真实情况。他说，杨月山当时是他的领导，但他与杨在专项教学与技术理解上有分歧，认为杨月山的教学有问题。他说对杨有个人看法，而且当时他认为在体操队受到一些不合理的待遇，所以才这样说的。本组稿件采写/本报记者王殿学田颖是什么让12岁冠军写下遗书罕见悲剧究竟谁在说谎？体操神童受虐待欲自杀母亲愤怒状告体校索赔50万	胡秉臣,王殿学,田颖,杨月山,马长森,朱辉,韩冬梅,高帅	负向	"The acrobatics prodigy's lawsuit against the physical school for abuse opened again yesterday afternoon. The witness turned to testify to explode four major contradictions. Gao Shuai, a youth acrobatics champion, sued Xian Nongtan Physical School for ""abuse"" again in Xuanwu Court. Six relevant personnel of Xian Nongtan Physical School appeared in court to testify to Xian Nongtan Physical School. Zhu Hui, the coach of the acrobatics team who said that the leader of the acrobatics team would not teach Gao Shuai, said that he had a conflict with the leader of the acrobatics team at that time, which was ""not the real situation"". Gao Shuai has won the national acrobatics championship many times at the children's and youth levels. He was selected to Xian Nongtan Sports School in 2006. On April 29 this year, Gao Shuai left school and ran away, and then moved to a mental hospital. Gao Shuai sued Xian Nongtan Physical School for more than 150000 yuan in compensation (this newspaper reported on November 8 and December 8). Gao Shuai did not appear in court yesterday. His mother Han Dongmei sat alone in the plaintiff's seat. She moved the television and DVD at home to the plaintiff's seat to prepare to play three DVDs and six VCDs as video and audio evidence. She said that Gao Shuai's present condition of mental depression had worsened and he was very irritable. She was worried that he would be stimulated if he watched the video. According to the evidence of Han Dongmei and Xian Nongtan Sports School, the main focus of the two sides was whether Gao Shuai was beaten and whether he had normal training in Xian Nongtan Sports School. Han Dongmei presented the recording of ""Yang Yueshan doesn't let him teach Gao Shuai"" which Zhu Hui said. Zhu Hui admitted that he had said that, but he said that it was because he had a conflict with Yang Yueshan, ""it was not the real situation."". The case was not announced in court. Focal point 1 Gao Shuai was punished? At the previous trial, Han Dongmei said that Gao Shuai was often beaten and punished at Xian Nongtan Sports School, and the players who beat him had more than 60 ways to beat him. Yesterday, the two sides debated on this. 【 Mother of Gao】 Others trained Gao Shuai to kneel down 【 Yang Yueshan】 This is to practice pressing the foot surface. Han Dongmei played a video in court. Yang Yueshan, the first coach of Gao Shuai who entered Xian Nongtan Sports School, was guiding a child to train. Gao Shuai was kneeling beside him. After the child stopped training, Gao Shuai helped move the equipment. Han Dongmei said that letting Gao Shuai kneel was inhuman abuse, not training, but letting him move things. In this regard, Yang Yueshan said that Gao Shuai knelt down to practice pressing the foot surface. Other children also had this action, which was not to abuse him. The lawyer of Xian Nongtan Physical School said that a CD could not explain the problem, and asked Han Dongmeiz to take the whole year's video. ""You should take the video for a whole year!"" Han Dongmei shouted at him. After the court, Gao Shuai said on the phone that Yang Yueshan made him kneel in the video. He said that the action of pressing the sole of the foot was to land on the knee and toe, and the upper body tried to lie back, while he was purely kneeling at that time. 【 Mother of Gao】 The captain has more than 60 ways to beat people 【 Yang Yueshan】 It's just a fight between children. Han Dongmei said that after Gao Shuai was bullied many times, the school held a parents' seminar, and Yang Yueshan, the head of the acrobatics team, and Hu Bingchen both attended it. The school also asked the children who beat them to write a review, and the children's review contained more than 60 ways to beat them. At the seminar, Yang Yueshan gave a note with dozens of beating methods to other parents, but not to Han Dongmei. Yang Yueshan denied the existence of the note, saying that the fight between children was just a kick and a loan of 1 yuan, not dozens of ways to beat them. Later, Hu Bingchen testified in court that the note existed, but now it was lost. Focus 2 Gao Shuai has not been trained? Gao Shuai's complaint said that he had never been trained at Xian Nongtan Sports School, and the coach did not teach him an action. Xian Nongtan Physical School issued a training plan of three coaches to the court, saying that Gao Shuai had a normal training. 【 Mother of Gao】 The coach's plan is ""blank"" for 4 months 【 Lawyer of the school】 This is a coach's miswriting. Gao Shuai's first coach, Yang Yueshan, said that he trained Gao Shuai strictly according to the training plan. Last July, he gave Gao Shuai to Coach Ma Changsen. After Ma Changsen trained, Coach Zhu Hui took Gao Shuai with him. Han Dongmei denied that Gao Shuai had been taught by Ma Changsen. She said that the coach's plan provided by Xian Nongtan Physical School was blank from July to October last year, and the coach's plan of Coach Ma Changsen was dated from July to October this year. At this time, Gao Shuai was being treated at the Peace Hospital. ""This is Ma Changsen's business."" Yang Yueshan said. The lawyer of Xian Nongtan Physical School explained that this was a mistake of Coach Ma Changsen. 【 Mother of Gao】 Zhu Hui once said ""leaders do not want to teach Gao Shuai"" 【 Zhu Hui】 This is not the real situation. Another coach of Gao Shuai, Zhu Hui, testified in court that Gao Shuai's level was higher than that when he entered Xian Nongtan Sports School when he took over the training of Gao Shuai. Han Dongmei immediately released a recording in which Zhu Hui said that Gao Shuai's level at that time could not keep up with the time when he entered Xian Nongtan. Gao Shuai could no longer do some basic actions, and said that this was a problem of the coach and the responsibility of the school. In the recording, Zhu Hui also said that Yang Yueshan and he said, do not teach Gao Shuai, but teach another child. The judge asked Zhu Hui to explain. He said that he did say these words, but they were just his words, not the real situation. He said that Yang Yueshan was his leader at that time, but he had differences with Yang in special teaching and technical understanding, and thought that Yang Yueshan's teaching was a problem. He said that he had a personal view on Yang, and at that time, he thought that he was treated unfairly in the gymnastics team, so he said that."

最低三折网银汇款手续费价格战打响证券时报记者唐晓本报讯为了引导客户使用网上银行，降低银行运营成本，近日交通银行(601328)、民生银行(600016)、光大银行、华夏银行(600015)等银行宣布下调网银汇款手续费，打折幅度低至3折。据了解，同一笔业务给银行带来的成本，网银是柜台的1/6-1/7，网银业务已经受到越来越多银行的重视。网银费率竞相打折近日，交通银行宣布，将个人网银同城跨行汇款手续费率由原来的按汇款金额0.7%下调至0.2%，最高收费由每笔汇款收50元下调至收20元。光大银行则明确宣布，个人网银转账汇款功能中的“本行转账”项、“跨行汇款”项手续费打3折，打折后本行异地转账、跨行汇款手续费由原来的0.5%降至0.15%，手续费上限也相应调低。华夏银行也推出了3-8折不等的优惠，打折范围既包括个人网银也包括企业网银，几乎覆盖该行网银所有转账汇款的功能项目。该优惠方案自4月8日开始执行。据了解，目前银行个人网上银行收费项目主要是转账汇款功能，其他功能除了业务本身收费外，通过网银办理不会加收费用，大部分银行网银目前暂时不收年费。网银业务日益受重视对于多家银行纷纷调低网银汇款手续费，深圳一家银行的电子银行部副总经理认为，是后来者急于通过优惠活动扩大市场规模的举措。网银业务处于推广阶段的银行，可通过此类活动吸引更多的客户使用该行网银。而网银成本低廉、可作为物理网点的重要补充，则是一些银行尤其股份制银行积极推广网银的原因。据悉，同样一笔业务，客户通过网银办理，银行支出的相应成本是柜台的1/6-1/7。随着电子银行功能的逐步完善，包括网银在内的电子银行业务已经为越来越多的人所接受。以工行(601398)为例，工行一季度电子银行交易额达到32万亿元，占该行全部业务量的比重为44.5%，较年初提高1.4个百分点。网银业务费率差异大据了解，即使同一笔网上银行业务，各家银行收费标准差异也较大，如光大银行本行异地转账、跨行汇款的手续费调整前也只有0.5%，调整后更低至0.15%。工行本行异地汇款、跨行汇款的手续费为0.9%，相当于光大银行调整前的1.8倍，调整后的6倍。此外，各家银行针对网银转账汇款业务的收费划分情况也不同，如有的银行本行异地汇款和跨行异地汇款、同城跨行汇款三项业务的手续费率相同，如工行和光大银行。也有银行各项功能收费标准更为细化，如招行(60036)专业版网银收费标准为：同城跨行汇款每笔2块；异地本行汇款收取汇款金额的0.2%，汇往公司账户则收取汇款金额的1%；异地跨行汇款收取汇款金额的1%。	唐晓	正向	"The price war of online banking remittance handling fee at a minimum of 30% discount for securities and Times reporters Tang Xiao reported that in order to guide customers to use online banking and reduce bank operating costs, China Minsheng Bank (600016), Everbright Bank, Huaxia Bank (600015) and other banks recently announced to reduce online banking remittance handling fee, with a discount of up to 30%. It is understood that the cost of the same business to the bank is 1/6-1/7 of the counter, and the online banking business has been valued by more and more banks. The online banking fee is competing for discounts. Recently, Bank of Communications announced that the interbank remittance service charge for personal online banking in the same city will be reduced from 0.7% of the original remittance amount to 0.2%, and the maximum charge will be reduced from 50 yuan to 20 yuan per remittance. Everbright Bank has made it clear that the ""transfer of this bank"" and ""cross bank remittance"" items in the personal online banking transfer and remittance functions will be discounted by 30%, and after discount, the service charge for the bank's inter provincial transfer and cross bank remittance will be reduced from 0.5% to 0.15%, and the service charge ceiling will also be adjusted accordingly. Huaxia Bank has also launched discounts ranging from 30% to 80%, including both personal online banking and corporate online banking, covering almost all transfer and remittance functions of the bank's online banking. The discount scheme has been implemented since April 8. It is understood that at present, the main charging project of personal online banking of banks is the transfer and remittance function. For other functions, there will be no additional charges through online banking. At present, most bank online banking does not charge annual fees. Online banking business is increasingly important. Liu Guoqiang, vice president of the Electronic Banking Department of a bank in Shenzhen, believes that the reason why many banks have lowered their online banking remittance handling fees is that the later comers are eager to expand the market scale through preferential activities. Banks whose online banking business is in the promotion stage can attract more customers to use the bank's online banking through such activities. And the low cost of online banking, which can be used as an important supplement to physical outlets, is the reason why some banks, especially shareholding banks, actively promote online banking. It is reported that for the same business, the corresponding cost of the bank through online banking is 1/6-1/7 of the counter. With the gradual improvement of the functions of electronic banking, including online banking, electronic banking has been accepted by more and more people. Taking ICBC (601398) as an example, the electronic banking transaction volume of ICBC reached 3.2 trillion yuan in the first quarter, accounting for 44.5% of the total business volume of the bank, 1.4 percentage points higher than the beginning of the year. Online banking businesses have large differences in fees and rates. It is understood that even the same online banking business has different charging standards among banks. For example, the handling fee for interbank remittance of this bank's interbank remittance and cross bank remittance of Everbright Bank was only 0.5% before adjustment, and it was lower after adjustment, only 0.15%. The handling fee for interbank remittance and interbank remittance of ICBC is 0.9%, which is 1.8 times of Everbright Bank before adjustment and 6 times after adjustment. In addition, banks also have different classification of charges for online banking transfer and remittance. For example, the service charge rates for three interbank remittance, interbank remittance and interbank remittance of the bank are the same, such as ICBC and Everbright Bank. Some banks also have more detailed charging standards for various functions, such as the professional edition of China Merchants Bank (60036), which charges 2 yuan for each interbank remittance in the same city; 0.2% of the remittance amount is charged for interbank remittance of the bank in different places, and 1% of the remittance amount is charged for remittance to the company account; 1% of the remittance amount is charged for interbank remittance in different places."

联通6月3G新增用户重回高位每经记者胡玉慧中国联通(600050，收盘价5.33元)6月3G用户数据如期回升。数据显示，6月联通3G用户净增数达到185.5万户，结束了此前连续两个月环比下滑的状态，回到今年3月份创下的单月最高点。至此，联通今年上半年的营运成绩单已经明了。期间公司累计新增3G用户988.5万户，月平均增长164.75万户；3G用户总量累计达到2394.5万户，对自身总计1.81亿户移动电话用户的渗透率上升至13.2%。6月用户数据的改善得益于公司营销重心调整，千元智能机在上个月正式上柜销售。近日联通总经理陆益民表示，接下来将继续力推千元智能手机。不过业内指出，年初联通定下了今年新增2500万户3G用户的发展目标。如今2011年已过半，上半年仅完成40%。若要完成预定用户增长目标，接下来6个月，月均新增3G用户数需扩大至252万户。而在今年5月24日召开的年度股东大会上，中国联通董事长常小兵明确表示，“今年公司有信心完成3G新增用户达到2500万户的目标”，甚至“可能超越这一目标”。联通新推的千元智能机营销策略对中低端用户吸引力相当明显。此前联通宣布全额包销的100万台中兴V880，单日最高销量接近万台，整个6月份日均销量接近5000台；以此计算仅这一机型就为公司吸引到15万新用户。中信证券研究员宫俊涛就表示，随着更多千元级别智能终端在7月份推出，将给对用户增长带来积极推动。	陆益民,常小兵,宫俊涛,胡玉慧	正向	"On June 3G, the new users of China Unicom returned to a high level. Hu Yuhui, a reporter from China Unicom (600050, closed at 5.33 yuan), rebounded as scheduled on June 3G. According to the data, the net increase of 3G users of China Unicom in June reached 1.855 million households, ending the previous two consecutive months of decline and returning to the highest point of a single month in March. Up to now, China Unicom's operating report card for the first half of this year has been clear. During this period, the company accumulated 9.885 million new 3G users, with an average monthly growth of 164.75 million; The total number of 3G users reached 23.945 million, and the penetration rate to its total number of 181 million mobile phone users rose to 13.2%. The improvement of user data in June benefited from the adjustment of the company's marketing focus. The thousand yuan smart mobile phone officially went on sale last month. Recently, Lu Yumin, the general manager of Unicom, said that he would continue to promote thousand yuan smartphones in the future. However, the industry pointed out that at the beginning of this year, China Unicom set the development goal of adding 25 million 3G users this year. Now that 2011 has passed half, only 40% has been completed in the first half of the year. If we want to complete the预定user growth target, the average number of new 3G users in the next 6 months needs to be expanded to 2520000. At the annual shareholders' meeting held on May 24 of this year, Chang Xiaobing, Chairman of China Unicom, made it clear that ""this year, the company is confident of achieving the goal of 25 million new 3G users"", and even ""it may exceed this goal"". The new marketing strategy of Unicom's thousand yuan smartphone is quite attractive to mid-low end users. Previously, China Unicom announced that 1000000 Zhongxing V880 was fully covered, with a single day's highest sales nearly ten thousand, and the average daily sales in the whole June was nearly 5000; According to this calculation, this model alone has attracted 150000 new users to the company. Gong Juntao, a researcher at Citic Securities, said that with more thousand yuan level intelligent terminals launched in July, it will have a positive promotion to user growth."

基金提前潜伏业绩暴增股216家公司中期预增翻番记者高丽霞2011年中报就将在本周拉开帷幕了。统计显示，今年中期的业绩预告中，喜多忧少。靓丽的中报业绩惹得市场蠢蠢欲动，也成为近期市场向上的主要动力。记者统计发现，在已经披露业绩预告的上市公司中，216家公司业绩翻番，而基金早于今年一季度就开始重仓布局就有146只。超六成公司业绩翻番Wind统计显示，截至昨日两市共有905家公司发布了今年中期的业绩预告，其中预增的个股多达714只，占比接近80%，业绩翻番的个股也多达216只。在这216只中期业绩暴增的个股中，基金于今年一季度重仓持有的就有146只。在沪深两市中报业绩增幅排行榜中，增长幅度在100倍以上的共有四家公司。上海新梅(600732)、恒逸石化(000703)、新华联(000620)、青海明胶(000606)分列前四位。不过这四只个股业绩的大幅增长均不是由于主营收入增长所带来的，要么是出售股权所获得的收益，要么是沾了重组的光。对于这种业绩变相暴增的公司，基金似乎兴趣不大，一季度这四只业绩增幅最大的个股均未获得基金的“光顾”。上海新梅同比业绩增幅105370%，位居两市之首。去年中期上海新梅仅实现净利润6.16万元。但今年中期公司预计2011年半年度归属于上市公司股东的净利润为5500万元—6500万元。业绩大幅增长主要是由于公司转让上海新兰房地产开发有限公司股权所产生的投资收益得以确认，且报告期内结转的营业收入增加。或许是由于业绩增长主要是来源于股权转让，而并非公司经营业绩的好转，上海新梅在二级市场上并无突出表现，此外一季度各大基金均没有光顾这只股票。排名第二是去年中小板新上市的恒逸石化，其预计今年中期将实现净利润11.24亿元—12.36亿元。不过，恒逸石化业绩的大幅增长，却是沾了重组的光。重组完成后的6月11日，恒逸石化即发布了业绩预盈公告，预计2011上半年实现净利润为11.24亿元-12.36亿元，半年的净利润已超过全年的业绩承诺。公司股价也从去年启动重组之初的10元左右，上涨至目前的44元附近，并曾经在今年4月中旬创下过54.50元的高点。新华联以19352%的业绩增幅暂居第三位。新华联的业绩增长也是来源于重组，公司借壳停牌了长达五年之久的S*ST圣方。新华联一复牌，在涨幅不受限制的复牌首日即恐怖大涨，从1.17元/股一口气狂涨到10.52元/股。此外，中期业绩增长在100倍以上的还有青海明胶，公司预计上半年实现净利润约3700万元，同比增长14478.41%。这一变化是由于公司转让四川禾正制药有限责任公司股权并确认相应收入而致。今年中期业绩增长幅度在10倍以上的公司还有冠福家用(002102)、ST张家界(000430)、美欣达(002034)、天伦置业(000711)、西安旅游(000610)等18只；业绩增长幅度在5至10倍的则有经纬纺机(000666)、维科精华(600152)、山东海化(000822)、美邦服饰(002269)、太极实业(600667)等22只。基金重仓提前布局在这216家一季度业绩增长至少一倍的个股中，基金于去年四季度重仓的就多达146只，占比高达68%。其中威孚高科(000581)赢得了众多的基金的青睐。截至一季度末，共有34只基金持有威孚高科，基金合计持股13013.51万股。不过与上期相比，基金还是减持了7246万股。华夏、易方达旗下均有四只基金持有威孚高科，分别合计持股2773.88万股、1409.57万股。南方基金旗下更是有5只基金持有该股，此外去年的冠军产品华商盛世成长也持有1109.73万股，其同门基金华商策略精选则持有897.17万股。一季度潜伏在金发科技(600143)的基金也多达32只，合计持有20542.04万股。兴业基金、信诚基金旗下各有四只产品均重仓持有该股，其中兴业基金持股最多，合计持股5037.56万股。东吴基金旗下更是有5只产品持有该股，合计持有1280.39万股。一季度末潜伏的基金数在20家以上的还有包钢稀土(600111)、中集集团(000039)、广汇股份(600256)、天山股份(000877)。获得10只-20只基金潜伏的则有中国北车(601299)、双鹭药业(002038)、金螳螂(002081)、山东黄金(600547)、辰州矿业(002155)、中恒集团(600252)、中环股份(002129)等21只个股。从行业分布来看，基金一季度末最青睐的行业是石油化学塑料塑胶，在这216只业绩翻番的公司中，石油化学塑料塑胶行业的就有31家，其次是机械设备仪表，基金一季度提前潜伏的有20家，第三位是金属、非金属行业，有19家。		正向	"The funds have been hiding in the performance of 216 companies for a long time. The mid-term forecast of 216 companies has doubled. Gao Lixia, a reporter in 2011, is going to be the beginning of this week. Statistics show that there are few worries in this year's mid-term performance forecast. The beautiful interim report results make the market restless, and they also become the main driving force for the recent market. The reporter's statistics found that among the listed companies that had disclosed earnings forecasts, 216 companies' earnings had doubled, and 146 of them had been overweighted by the fund since the first quarter of this year. Wind statistics shows that more than 60% of the companies' performance has doubled. As of yesterday, 905 companies in the two cities had released this year's mid-term performance forecast, of which 714 were forecast to increase, accounting for nearly 80%, and the number of shares with doubled performance also reached 216. Among the 216 mid-term performance growth stocks, 146 were heavily held by funds in the first quarter of this year. In the ranking list of performance growth of CSRC's semi annual report in Shanghai and Shenzhen, there are four companies with growth rate of more than 100 times. Shanghai Xinmei (600732), Hengyi Petrochemical (000703), Xinhualian (000620) and Qinghai Gelatine (000606) ranked first. However, the substantial growth of these four shares is not due to the growth of main business income, but either the income from the sale of equity or the benefit of restructuring. For this kind of company with disguised performance growth, the fund seems to have little interest. In the first quarter, the four shares with the largest performance growth did not get the ""attention"" of the fund. Shanghai Xingmei's performance grew by 105370% year on year, ranking first in the two cities. Shanghai Xinmei only realized a net profit of 61600 yuan in the middle of last year. However, in the middle of this year, the company expects that the net profit attributable to shareholders of the listed company in the first half of 2011 will be 55 million yuan - 65 million yuan. The main reason for the substantial growth of performance is that the investment income generated by the company's transfer of equity of Shanghai Xinlan Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. has been confirmed, and the operating income transferred during the reporting period has increased. Perhaps because the performance growth mainly comes from equity transfer, rather than the improvement of the company's operating performance, Shanghai Xingmei has no outstanding performance in the secondary market. In addition, the major funds did not visit this stock in the first quarter. The second largest was Hengyi Petrochemical, a new small and medium-sized board listed last year, which is expected to achieve a net profit of 11.24 billion yuan - 12.36 billion yuan in the middle of this year. However, the substantial growth of Hengyi Petrochemical's performance is due to the restructuring. On June 11, after the completion of the restructuring, Hengyi Petrochemical issued an announcement on the expected profit, expecting that the net profit in the first half of 2011 would be 11.24 billion yuan - 12.36 billion yuan, and the net profit for half a year has exceeded the annual performance commitment. The company's share price also rose from around 10 yuan at the beginning of last year's restructuring to the current 44 yuan, and hit a high of 54.50 yuan in mid April this year. Xinhualian ranked third with a performance growth of 19352%. Xinhualian's performance growth also comes from restructuring, and the company borrows a shell that has been suspended for five years * ST Sheng Fang. Xinhualian once terrorized a huge increase from 1.17 yuan/share to 10.52 yuan/share on the first day of its resume trading without restrictions on the increase. In addition, Qinghai Gelatine also has more than 100 times of medium-term performance growth. The company is expected to achieve a net profit of about 37 million yuan in the first half of the year, up 14478.41% year on year. This change is due to the fact that the company transferred the equity of Sichuan Hezheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and confirmed the corresponding income. There are also 18 companies whose performance grew by more than 10 times in the first half of this year, such as Guanfu Home (002102), ST Zhangjiajie (000430), Meixin (002034), Tian Lun Real Estate (000711), Xi'an Tourism (000610) and so on; The performance growth rate is 5 to 10 times, including经纬纺机 (000666), Vicor Essence (600152), Shandong Haihua (000822), Metersbonwe (002269), Taiji Industry (600667) and 22 others. Funds heavily laid out in the first quarter of this year, among the 216 companies whose performance grew at least twice in the first quarter, there were as many as 146 funds in the fourth quarter of last year, accounting for as high as 68%. Among them, Weifu Gaoke (000581) has won the favor of many funds. At the end of the first quarter, 34 funds held Weifu Gaoke, with a combined shareholding of 13013.51 million shares. However, compared with the previous period, the fund still reduced its holdings by 72.46 million shares. Huaxia and Yifangda both had four funds holding Weifu Gaoke, with a combined shareholding of 2773.88 million shares and 1409.57 million shares respectively. Southern Fund also has five funds under its banner holding this stock, In addition, the champion product Huashang盛世growth also holds 11097300 shares, and its fellow fund Huashang Strategy Selection holds 8971700 shares. The fund hidden in Jinfare Technology (600143) in the first quarter also has 32 shares, with a combined holding of 20542.04 million shares. Xingye Fund and Citicent Fund each have four products under their banner, which are heavily invested in the stock, of which Xingye Fund holds the most shares, with a combined shareholding of 5037.56 million shares. Dongwu Fund even has 5 products under its banner holding this stock, with a combined holding of 1280.39 million shares. There are more than 20 funds hidden at the end of the first quarter, including Baogang Rare Earth (600111), China International Group (000039), Guanghui Shares (600256), Tianshan Shares (000877). There are 21 shares, including China North Vehicle (601299), Shuanglu Pharmaceutical (002038), Jin螳螂(002081), Shandong Gold (600547), Chenzhou Mining (002155), Zhongheng Group (600252), and Zhonghuan Shares (002129), which have been hidden by 10-20 funds. In terms of industry distribution, the industry that the fund favored most at the end of the first quarter was oil, chemical, plastic and plastic. There were 31 companies in the oil, chemical, plastic and plastic industries among the 216 companies with doubled performance, followed by machinery, equipment and instruments. The fund had 20 companies in the first quarter, and the third was the metal and non metal industry, with 19 companies"
驻日美军战斗飞行队可能迁至韩国部署训练中新网3月22日电据韩联社报道，因日本大地震和核电站泄漏影响，驻日美国空军第35战斗飞行团属下的F-16战斗机部队可能会选择在韩国等其他地区部署和进行训练。美国《星条旗报(StarsandStripes)》22日报道称，第35战斗飞行团长麦克·罗德斯坦因上校19日在基地表示，为了继续进行训练，有必要将第14战斗飞行队的驾驶员和维修人员派往韩国等其他地区，进行部署和训练。他还说，三?基地有可能会成为日本地震赈灾物资的枢纽基地，所以F-16战斗机需要另寻其他训练场地。报道称，罗德斯坦并没有具体指出对外部署的准确时间表，只表示对外部署的时间大约为两周到一个月。三?基地位于日本发生大地震的东北地区，离福岛核电站约300公里。有分析认为，第14战斗机飞行大队可能因核辐射在寻地避难。据悉，离福岛核电站约260公里的美国海军厚木基地曾于17至18日进行调遣，将1000多兵力和部分飞机迁往关岛的安德逊基地。	麦克,罗德斯坦	正向	The battle flight team of the US troops stationed in Japan may be redeployed to South Korea for training. chinanews. com, March 22- The Associated Press reported that due to the impact of the Japanese earthquake and nuclear power plant leakage, the F-16 fighter detachment under the 35th Battle Flight Corps of the US Air Force stationed in Japan may choose to deploy and train in other areas such as South Korea.

男子手持枪状打火机抢走6.2万本报讯(记者唐煜实习生李慧娟张博阳)25日晚11时05分左右，汉阳鹦鹉大道翠微路口一建行自助银行内，一对夫妻存款时，一男子持假枪抢走6.2万元现金逃跑。事发后，数十位警察连夜搜索，约10小时将这名劫匪抓获，并追回4.5万元。当时，董先生与妻子携带大量现金在该自助银行内汇款，当存入约1万元时，一名年约30岁、身高约1.75米的男子抢夺董先生的塑料袋，董先生及妻子奋起反抗，抢下该男子的武器，劫匪则拿走装有现金的塑料袋。董先生一边追赶一边呼救，妻子急忙报警。劫匪跑出数十米翻过银行铁栅门到银行营业厅后院，翻过院墙进入附近平田小区。董先生夫妇追赶不上，发现“手枪”原是枪状打火机。事发后，数十民警赶到现场，围住平田小区，并对可疑地方进行搜查。这名男子劫抢客户的过程，被银行录像拍下。经调查，这名男子租住在现场附近一居民区内，共抢走董先生夫妻俩6.2万元现金，并很快锁定山西人林某有重大嫌疑。昨日上午9时许，在案发约10小时后，林某在汉口民生路附近被警方抓获，并追回了4.5万元现金。据称，林某来汉没有找到工作，准备抢劫后离汉。昨日上午，记者在现场见到，自助银行的四台取款机已恢复正常营业，取款机前顾客在排队等候。欢迎发表评论我要评论	李慧娟,张博阳,唐煜,林某,董先生	负向	"A man with a gun-shaped lighter robbed 620000 yuan, (reporter Tang Yu, intern Li Huijuan, Zhang Boyang) At around 11:05 p.m. on the 25th, in a self-service bank of CCB at Cuiwei Road, Hongyang Parrot Avenue, a man with a fake gun robbed 62000 yuan in cash and escaped when a couple deposited money. After the incident, dozens of police searched overnight, and it took about 10 hours to catch the robber and recover 45000 yuan. At that time, Mr. Dong and his wife carried a large amount of cash in the self service bank to remit money. When they deposited about 10000 yuan, a man who was about 30 years old and about 1.75 meters tall grabbed Mr. Dong's plastic bag. Mr. Dong and his wife fought back, grabbed the man's weapon, and the robber took away the plastic bag with cash. Mr. Dong called for help while chasing, and his wife called the police in a hurry. The robber ran out dozens of meters to flip over the bank's iron fence gate to the back yard of the bank's business hall, flipped over the courtyard wall and entered the nearby Pingtian community. Mr. Dong and his wife could not catch up, and found that the ""pistol"" was originally a gun-shaped lighter. After the incident, dozens of police officers arrived at the scene, surrounded the Pingtian community, and searched the suspicious places. The process of this man's robbery of customers was video recorded by the bank. After investigation, the man rented a house in a residential area near the scene, robbed Dong and his wife of 62000 yuan in cash, and quickly locked Lin, a Shanxi native, as a major suspect. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, about 10 hours after the case, Lin was arrested by the police near Minsheng Road, Hankou, and 45000 yuan in cash was recovered.

雨枫：九城不会因为失去魔兽而倒下新浪科技讯4月16日晚间消息，网络游戏业内人士雨枫今日与新浪科技连线时表示，虽然九城在失去魔兽世界代理权之后，短期内会亏损。但按照九城目前的条件，不会因为此事倒下。以下为对话实录：新浪科技：在这场风波中，九城是不是最大的输家？最大的赢家是网易还是暴雪？雨枫：我觉得输家只有九城一家，所以这里没有最大的输家。最大的赢家是暴雪，而不是网易。但九城的失败是失去了绝大多数收入，但是在过去的四年时间里面，九城靠运营魔兽世界这款产品实现了上市、拿到了巨额现金、也拿到了EA公司的产品代理权。如果我们斤斤从过去四年的这个结果来看，也只能说“不圆满”，而不是输了。为什么说网易不是最大的赢家呢？因为我们都知道九城当年签下这个产品的时候，代价已经很高了。今天暴雪把这个产品又交到网易手里，我想网易开出的条件应该不会比当年差。而九城在过去四年里面，利润一直不是很高。这里就有一个问题，网易运营魔兽世界会不会带来丰厚的利润？目前，我自己和一些业内的朋友的判断是，网易的收益未必会比九城的高。当初网易运营战网的时候，业内问的问题主要是对网易的财务有什么影响，因为战网模式在国内还是有很多现实的困难。现在网易花掉很高的代价将魔兽世界这个游戏拿下，那网易和暴雪会将这款游戏作为一个重要的收入来源。因为战网不一定能够带来大量收入，但是魔兽世界可以。问题是今天网易付出的代价会比九城当年付出的代价高，从九城过去四年的财报来看，魔兽世界的毛利不是很高，而且九城在很多方面受到暴雪的制约。实际上，暴雪抓住了九城的一个命门，九城没有别的收入来源，暴雪就可以任意地提价。这件事情要是放在网易和丁磊身上，就魔兽世界这个产品来讲，他讨价还价的能力未必比九城多多少。虽然网易可以说公司比较大，收入比较分散。但暴雪还是占据了一个相对主动的位置。新浪科技：现在已经确认的是，九城失去了魔兽世界这款游戏，对于他们来说，短期和长期有何影响？雨枫：从短期上来讲，这对九城来说是一件坏事。超过95%的收入来源没有了，这点没有什么疑问。从长期来讲，这对九城来说未必是一件坏事。对于九城来说，魔兽世界这款游戏是一个太大的存在。因为有了魔兽，它把九城所能拿出来的资源、能力和管理人员的精力完全吸引过去。这种状态下，九城想做一些别的事情是有难度的。在过去四年里，九城拿到了行业里大量被看好的产品，但是一直都没有成功。除了产品本身的问题之外，我们回过头来想，这里是不是存在一个九城“拆东墙补西墙”的情况。由于魔兽带来了95%的收入，就不得不先保证它的运营。这样一来，新产品的上线和运营就有一定的削弱。现在九城没有了魔兽，公司在短期是亏损了。但要看一下九城本身，他拥有3亿多的现金，他背后站着EA。那九城会因为这件事情倒下吗？或者退市吗？大不了重新开始。但现在这个时间点上，九城已经比四年前的条件好了不知多少呗，我认为九城不吃亏。新浪科技：为什么九城用了4年的时间，却仍然摆脱不了对魔兽的依赖？雨枫：从朱骏拿下魔兽在中国的代理权第一天开始，他就在考虑如何摆脱对这款游戏的依赖，这也是过去四年里面九城一直在做的事情。从财务的角度来看，他没有做成。原因让我来分析的话，有如下原因。第一，九城的运营能力。这里包括了市场推广和客户服务，也包括与政府部门的沟通能力。在过去这四年里，九城运营团队的能力并没有得到提高，这是非常失误的一点。另外一点，产品线选择的问题。九城选择的产品主要是大家都看好的大产品。但业界除了魔兽这样的大产品，也有一些不出名但很成功的小产品。九城把过多的精力放在了海外游戏的代理上，而没有将眼光投向国内，寻找那些更适合中国玩家习惯的产品。新浪科技：网易将如何实现产品的过渡？网易到底为什么要代理魔兽这款游戏？雨枫：刚才我们分析过，从财务上来讲，虽然魔兽这款游戏是有钱可赚，但丁磊没有像当年朱骏那样，他非得要拿下这个产品才能实现某种目的这个地步。没有魔兽，对于网易来讲无关痛痒。有了魔兽，对于网易来讲也就是10%到20%的成长机会。这个问题我至今也没有想清楚，我认为丁磊不是冲着利润去的。在过去的一两年，网易在产品开发上遇到了一定的挫折。像《大唐豪侠》和《天下2》这些产品都没有做起来，而且《天下2》是魔兽世界的正面竞争产品。但很明显，这个产品是失败的。虽然说网易这几年做《梦幻西游》和《大话》做得顺风顺水，但游戏之外的业务收入还是很少，门户业务和有道搜索的收入一直不稳定。其实代理魔兽这件事情是一个信号。网易成立了杭州研究院，核心是研发免费游戏。而现在他不仅做免费游戏，还在做代理游戏。这就是网易战略转型的信号，未来可能不再把自己局限为研发和运营游戏的运营商，他可能把自己放在一个更大的平台上。但暴雪的立场是很强硬的，如果依靠暴雪来转型，我相信这里有巨大的困难。新浪科技：在今年6月，九城的授权就会到期。能否预测一下用户资料将会怎么处理？雨枫：这件事情说法很多，有一种说法是这样：从合同角度来看，当初的合约规定所有的用户资料都在暴雪手中。因为当时包括盛大在内都在争夺这款游戏，但只有九城什么都没有，如果不能拿到这款游戏就无法生存下去。现在来看，这个条款是很亏本的。(于连)	EA,朱骏,丁磊,雨枫,于连	正向	"Yufeng: The nine cities will not fall down because of the loss of Warcraft. Sina Technology News reported on the evening of April 16. Yufeng, a game industry insider, said today when he connected with Sina Technology that although the nine cities would suffer losses in the short term after losing the agency rights of World of Warcraft, they would not fall down because of this matter according to the current conditions of the nine cities. The following is a transcript of the dialogue: Sina Technology: In this crisis, is the Nine Cities the biggest loser? Yufeng: I think the loser is only the Nine Cities, so there is no biggest loser here. The biggest winner is Blizzard, not Netease. But the failure of the Nine Cities is to lose the majority of its income. In the past four years, the Nine Cities has relied on the operation of the World of Warcraft to achieve listing, obtain huge cash, and obtain the product agency rights of EA Company. If we only say ""imperfect"" rather than lose from the results of the past four years, I think the conditions offered by Netease today should not be worse than they were years ago. However, the profit of the Nine Cities has not been very high in the past four years. There is a question here: will Netease's operation of World of Warcraft bring huge profits? At present, my judgment and some friends in the industry is that Netease's earnings may not be higher than those of the Nine Cities. When Netease operated Battle net, the main question in the industry was what impact it would have on Netease's finance, because the Battle net mode still has many practical difficulties in China. Now Netease has spent a lot of money to get the game World of Warcraft, and Netease and Blizzard will take this game as an important source of income. Because Battle net may not bring in a lot of money, but World of Warcraft can. The problem is that the price Netease pays today will be higher than the price Nine Cities paid years ago. From the perspective of Nine Cities' financial reports in the past four years, the gross profit of World of Warcraft is not very high, and Nine Cities is constrained by Blizzard in many aspects. In fact, Blizzard caught a lifeline of Nine Cities. Since Nine Cities has no other sources of income, Blizzard can arbitrarily raise prices. If this matter is placed on Netease and Ding Lei, in terms of this product of World of Warcraft, his bargaining power may not be much more than that of Nine Cities. Although Netease can say that the company is large and the income is dispersed. But Blizzard still occupied a relatively active position. Sina Technology: It has been confirmed that the Nine Cities has lost the game of World of Warcraft. What is the short-term and long-term impact on them? Yufeng: In the short term, this is a bad thing for Nine Cities. There is no doubt that more than 95% of the sources of income have been lost. In the long run, this may not be a bad thing for Nine Cities. For the Nine Cities, the game World of Warcraft is a big deal. Because of Warcraft, it completely attracts the resources, capabilities and energy of managers that the Nine Cities can offer. In this case, it is difficult for Nine Cities to do something else. In the past four years, Nine Cities has won a lot of promising products in the industry, but it has never succeeded. In addition to the problem of the product itself, we can think back, there is a possibility that Nine Cities ""tear down the east wall to make up for the west wall"". Because Warcraft brings 95% of the income, it has to guarantee its operation first. As a result, the launch and operation of new products are somewhat weakened. Now the Nine Cities has lost the World of Warcraft, and the company has lost money in the short term. But look at Fucheng itself, he has more than 300 million cash, and EA is behind him. Will the Nine Cities fall down because of this matter? Or delisting? Start all over again. But at this time point, Nine Cities has been much better than four years ago. I think Nine Cities is not at a loss"
民生证券：资金面不低头A股难抬头□民生证券研究所策略团队上调存准率之后，加息预期再起，市场由此也出现了连续破位下跌的走势。本周二公开市场一年期央票利率继续走高10BP，由于已在市场预期之内，市场反应较为平淡，我们预计6月到7月央行还会再次加息。在资金面压力依然较大，而物价回落及政策转向信号并未出现之前，市场筑底的格局不会改变，投资者可逢低布局大消费、业绩确定的成长股和航空板块。经济增速温和走低5月经济数据进一步验证了我们对于未来经济的判断，即去库存周期下，经济增速进一步温和走低。5月工业增加值同比增长13.3%，在4月13.4%的基础上低位趋稳。5月消费和出口实际增速明显回落，但投资需求依然旺盛，实际增速继续上行，预计宏观经济将于三季度实现软着陆。从三驾马车的表现来看，投资需求旺盛，终端消费增速继续放缓。5月份，社会消费品零售总额同比增长16.9%，低于市场17.4%的同比增速预期，较4月回落0.2个百分点。扣除出口价格提高和人民币升值的影响，5月出口实际增长2.5%，比4月回落9.5个百分点。5月投资需求依然旺盛，剔除投资价格上涨因素，5月投资实际增长19.0%，比4月提高0.6个百分点。“提准”重挫资金面自5月中旬上调准备金率以来，银行体系的流动性持续偏紧。6月14日央行再次提高存款准备金率，从而令本已偏紧的资金面进一步趋紧。本次调准后货币市场资金利率再次大幅走高，并带动国债收益率上行。6月21日SHIBOR7天利率已经飙升至8.33%，创今年2月以来的新高，Shibor隔夜利率也上升至7.14%的高位。我们认为，6月底之前宏观资金面压力不会减轻，短期资金利率波动将加大。首先，由于6月份是银行半年度报表考核的关键时期，因此本身就是传统的资金需求旺季；其次，由于一季度末金融机构超储率为1.5%，预计本次提准后银行超储率将进一步降低，对资金面的边际影响会明显放大；再次，商业银行实施日均存贷比考核使得银行月末腾挪表外资产的策略失效；最后，由于上一次提准造成的流动性的紧张局面还未得以缓解，此次存准的上调无论是从资金存量还是心理预期方面，都将进一步放大短期资金利率的波动。物价拐点隐现紧缩政策趋于谨慎5月CPI同比上涨5.5%，创下34个月以来的新高。但从环比数据来看，物价走势出现了一些积极的变化，其中PPI环比上涨0.3%，较4月环比回落了0.2%，原材料购进价格也出现了0.5%的环比回落。在翘尾因素的影响下，CPI有可能在6、7月份再创本轮通胀的新高，但之后物价将缓慢回落，四季度有望明显回落，预计今年11月和12月CPI同比涨幅将回落至4%左右。从通胀走势来看，如果下半年通胀压力真能有效缓解，物价下行将是大概率事件。从经济下行风险来看，目前阶段实体经济已经出现了经济下行的迹象，且微观调研数据表明实体经济的需求也已呈现出下行迹象。从货币紧缩的程度来看，准备金率上调和预期内的一次加息对经济的调控作用将边际递增。故我们预计通胀环比下降将是政策拐点的催化剂，从时间上看，2011年7、8月份紧缩政策仍将继续谨慎。8月前筑底格局难改我们预计6月资金压力将维持高位，短期市场仍将延续筑底格局。受翘尾因素的影响，6月CPI存在继续上冲的风险，但食品价格将于下半年趋稳，同比涨幅回落，预计物价将于6-7月见顶、8月份回落。在通胀拐点可期、经济回落的背景下，下半年紧缩政策的进一步实施趋于谨慎。在通胀回落没有得到数据验证之前，市场对通胀的压力仍然难以释怀，短期市场继续筑底。不过，我们认为，8月以后市场有望迎来反转行情，全年将演绎“N”型走势。8月份以后，通胀回落趋于明朗，政策的核心将由控物价转向稳增长、促转型，宏观经济也将于三季度触底。届时，投资者预期向好，制约市场的力量将显著减轻，8月份以后市场有望迎来趋势性的反转行情。我们看好经济结构转型背景下的食品饮料、商贸、家电等大消费板块、以计算机信息服务为代表的新兴成长板块、受益于人民币加速升值，以及即将进入旺季的航空板块，建议积极布局。点击进入[上证指数吧]讨论		正向	"Minsheng Securities: The A-share market is hard to lift its head when the funding surface does not bow down. □ The strategy team of Minsheng Securities Research Institute adjusted the reserve requirement ratio, and then the expectation of interest rate hikes rose again, and the market also showed a trend of consecutive breaks and falls. On Tuesday of this week, the one year central bank ticket interest rate in the public market continued to rise by 10BP. As it was within market expectations, the market reaction was relatively calm. We expect the central bank will raise interest rates again in June and July. The market structure of bottom building will not change until the pressure on funds is still high, and the signal of price decline and policy shift has not appeared. Investors can make a low level layout of large consumer goods, performance growth stocks and the aviation sector. The moderate decline of economic growth in May further verified our judgment on future economic growth, that is, under the destocking cycle, the economic growth rate further declined moderately. In May, the added value of industries above designated size grew by 13.3% year on year, stabilizing at a low level on the basis of 13.4% in April. In May, the actual growth rate of consumption and exports declined significantly, but the investment demand was still strong, and the actual growth rate continued to rise, and it is expected that the macro economy will achieve a soft landing in the third quarter. Judging from the performance of the three驾horsemen, investment demand is strong, and the growth rate of terminal consumption continues to slow down. In May, the total retail sales of consumer goods in society grew by 16.9% year on year, lower than the market's expectation of 17.4% year on year, and down 0.2 percentage points from April. In May, the actual export growth was 2.5%, down 9.5 percentage points from April, excluding the impact of export price increases and RMB appreciation. In May, investment demand was still strong. Excluding the factor of investment price rise, investment actually grew by 19.0% in May, up 0.6 percentage points from April. Since the central bank raised the deposit reserve ratio in mid May, the liquidity of the banking system has been continuously tight. On June 14, the central bank once again raised the deposit reserve ratio, making the already tight funding surface further tighten. After this adjustment, the money market interest rate rose again, driving up the treasury yield. On June 21, the SHIBOR7 day interest rate had soared to 8.33%, a new high since February this year, and the Shibor overnight interest rate also rose to a high of 7.14%. We believe that the pressure on macro funds will not be eased before the end of June, and the fluctuation of short-term capital interest rates will increase. First of all, since June is the key period for banks' semi-annual report evaluation, it is a traditional peak season for capital demand in itself; Secondly, since the super storage rate of financial institutions at the end of the first quarter was 1.5%, it is expected that the super storage rate of banks will further decrease after this preparation is raised, and the marginal effect on the capital market will be significantly amplified; Thirdly, the implementation of the average daily loan to deposit ratio by commercial banks makes the strategy of banks to move off-balance sheet assets at the end of the month ineffective; Finally, since the liquidity tension caused by the last increase in the deposit reserve ratio has not been alleviated, the increase in the deposit reserve ratio this time will further amplify the fluctuation of short-term capital interest rates in terms of both capital stock and psychological expectations. The price turning point is hidden, and the tightening policy tends to be cautious. The CPI in May rose by 5.5% year on year, hitting a new high in 34 months. However, from the perspective of month on month data, the price trend has shown some positive changes, among which the PPI rose by 0.3% month on month, down 0.2% from April, and the price of raw materials also fell by 0.5% month on month. Under the influence of the tailing up factor, the CPI is likely to hit a new high in this round of inflation in June and July, but then prices will slowly fall back, and it is expected to fall back significantly in the fourth quarter. It is expected that the year-on-year increase of CPI in November and December this year will fall back to around 4%. From the perspective of inflation trend, if the inflation pressure in the second half of the year can be effectively alleviated, the decline in prices will be a probable event. From the perspective of economic downside risks, the real economy has shown signs of economic decline at this stage, and the micro survey data also shows that the demand of the real economy has shown a trend of decline. In terms of the degree of monetary tightening, the central bank's decision to raise the reserve requirement ratio and the expected interest rate hike will have a marginal effect on the economy. Therefore, we expect that the decline in inflation month on month will be a catalyst for the policy turning point. In terms of time, the tightening policy will still be cautious in July and August 2011. It is difficult to change the pattern of bottoming out before August. We expect that the funding pressure in June will remain high, and the market will still continue the pattern of bottoming out in the short term. Affected by the tailing factor, the CPI in June is at risk of continuing to rise. However, food prices will stabilize in the second half of the year, and the year-on-year growth rate will decline. It is expected that prices will peak in June and July and retreat in August. In the context of inflation inflection point and economic decline, the further implementation of tightening policies in the second half of the year tends to be cautious. The market is still under pressure from inflation before the decline of inflation is verified by data, and the market continues to bottom out in the short term. However, we believe that the market is expected to welcome a reversal in August and will show an ""N"" shape for the whole year. After August, the decline of inflation tends to be clear, and the core of the policy will shift from controlling prices to stabilizing growth and promoting transformation, and the macro economy will bottom out in the third quarter. At that time, investors' expectations will improve, and the power that restrains the market will be significantly reduced. After August, the market is expected to welcome a trend reversal.

小物件大乐趣实用家具装扮新年生活农历新年到了，各家各户都在忙碌地准备着新年的居家用品，很多消费者都会在年前选择一些小茶几、休闲椅、小玄关柜等小件家具来装扮爱家，这些小家具实用且养眼，很适合新年居家使用。小茶几增添几分温暖新年里，难免会有亲朋好久的聚会，两三人的小聚，一款用来摆放茶水、点心的小茶几就很有必要。浅淡木色茶几或原木茶几非常适合与现今流行的浅色系列沙发相配，其造型简单，但讲究精致，色调温和，没有繁杂的功能，和简洁明快的沙发相配，展现出居室的唯美。这些小茶几可根据使用需要灵活地挪动它们，生活中也多了一份方便和轻松，为改换客厅的样子提供了方便，家人、朋友在新年里也会得到新鲜的感受。新年里，三五好友围绕着小茶几喝茶聊天、打纸牌，那份节日的温暖自然流淌心底。小鞋柜点亮局部空间一般家庭，玄关的空间相对都很狭小，此时，镶上镜子的小鞋柜可以使空间显得敞亮，而且非常便于出门前整理衣冠，客人造访时也不显得局促。各种造型的镜面镶嵌在带有顶线的柜体中，显得大气、干净，适当加入一些白色的点缀还可以改变深木色的沉闷印象，为鞋柜增添一份舒适感。而镜子旁边设计的两排挂钩，不仅方便了使用，也使空间整洁而不凌乱。目前，人们一般在进门处摆放鞋柜，习惯于在此换鞋以卸外界之尘。市场上的鞋柜，有“屏风式”、“低柜式”、“转角式”等。选择时在色彩和造型上应与整个居室风格一致，如“屏风式”设计，鞋柜内的空间大，可分上下层，上部以储藏全家换季鞋子，以盒装存放，排列有序，下部可分几层，如上层是进家后所换拖鞋，下层为日常换鞋之用，使用时十分方便。“懒人”沙发带来假日享受如今，一种不注意“形象”的“懒人沙发”开始成为都市人家中的新宠。它让从办公室正襟危坐的白领们回家后能像一滩泥似的坐在上面，无拘无束甚至“得意忘形”。新年假期是一个休闲的好时机，一款“懒人沙发”让你的假期舒适而安逸。你可以当它是靠背椅、单人床、大沙发、肥座垫，只要你喜欢，随便折腾好了，这是一种感觉，完全放松的，带着些温软、简单和自由的呼吸，在新年的喧闹中，开启另一年的梦想。“懒人沙发”是指以耐磨抗拉布质或皮质为面料，以发泡聚苯乙烯小球填充的软家居，其设计理念是不断打破陈规，按科学的人体工程理论设计，满足“任何形体、任何地点、任何地表”的需要。同时采用可拆洗的外布料，尽可能维护简单舒适的生活方式。其魅力在于，只要它放在那里，你就忍不住想要去坐一坐，一旦你坐上去，就会被饱满的粒子热情拥抱，总之，它能在一刹那间最忠诚最完全地满足你的需要。“休闲椅”独享新年的乐趣椅子或许是家居产品中最富于变化的生力军之一，总是带给我们盛大的视觉体验。居室里的大部分家具，包括陈列柜、电视柜、沙发等不会轻易更换，时间长了难免缺乏新意，在新年的扮家计划里，多几把造型别致的休闲椅子，常常会神奇地成为目光的焦点。新年的美好时节里，独坐一把浪漫随性的休闲椅，安享唯美的生活情致，享受最惬意的居家生活。休闲椅在各个不同空间有不同的选择。客厅是公共区域，比较热闹，所以休闲椅一定要颜色跳跃醒目，风格独特，成为一大风景，同时也要让人坐起来舒适，与沙发搭配得当。卧室家具种类不多，在卧室中添置一把休闲椅是一个人调整心情的方法之一。卧室里的休闲椅要与卧室环境匹配，颜色和款式不要太过跳跃，以免“打扰”到安静的空间。书房的休闲椅则更要求功能性和舒适度的统一。		正向	"The small objects have great fun and practical furniture to decorate the New Year's life. The lunar New Year is coming, and every family is busy preparing new year's household goods. Many consumers will choose some small coffee tables, recliners, small foyers and other small pieces of furniture to decorate their homes at the end of the year. These small pieces of furniture are practical and beautiful, very suitable for New Year's home use. The small tea table adds a few warm New Year's festivals. It is inevitable that relatives and friends will have a long gathering. A small tea table for two or three people to place tea and snacks is very necessary. The light wood coffee table or the log coffee table is very suitable to match the light color series sofa that is popular nowadays. Its shape is simple but exquisite, the color is warm, and there is no complicated function. It is matched with the simple and lively sofa to show the beauty of the room. These small tea tables can be moved around flexibly according to the needs of use, and there is also a convenience and ease in life, which provides convenience for changing the appearance of the living room. Family members and friends will also get a new feeling in the New Year. In the New Year, a group of good friends gather around the tea table to drink tea, chat and play paper cards, and the warmth of the festival naturally flows to the bottom of my heart. Small shoe cabinets light up the local space. Generally speaking, the space of the porch of a family is relatively small. At this time, the small shoe cabinet inlaid with a mirror can make the space look bright, and it is very convenient to tidy up clothes and hats before going out. It is not cramped when visitors come. Various shapes of mirrors are inlaid in the cabinet with top lines, which looks atmospheric and clean. Appropriately adding some white decorations can also change the dull impression of dark wood, adding a sense of comfort to the shoe cabinet. The two rows of hooks designed beside the mirror are not only convenient to use, but also clean and tidy. At present, people usually place shoe cabinets at the door and get used to changing shoes here to unload dust from the outside world. The shoe cabinets on the market include ""screen style"", ""low cabinet style"", ""corner style"", etc. When choosing, the color and shape should be consistent with the style of the whole room, such as the ""screen style"" design. The space in the shoe cabinet is large, which can be divided into upper and lower layers. The upper part is used to store the family's seasonal shoes in boxes, arranged in order. The lower part can be divided into several layers, such as the slippers after entering the house in the upper layer and the daily shoes in the lower layer. They are very convenient to use. ""Lazy"" sofa brings holiday enjoyment Nowadays, a ""lazy sofa"" that does not pay attention to ""image"" has begun to become a new favorite in urban families. It lets the white-collar workers who sit in the office like a mud sit on it after they go home. They are free and even ""forget their manners"". New Year's holiday is a good time to relax. A ""lazy sofa"" makes your holiday comfortable and leisurely. You can treat it as a back chair, a single bed, a big sofa, or a fat seat cushion. Just mess around if you like. This is a feeling, completely relaxed, with some warmth, simplicity and freedom of breathing. In the noise of the New Year, we will open up another year's dream. ""Lazy sofa"" refers to a soft home furnishing filled with small foamed polystyrene balls, which is made of wear-resistant and tensile cloth or leather. Its design concept is to constantly break the rules and design according to the scientific theory of human engineering to meet the needs of ""any shape, any location, any surface"". At the same time, the detachable outer cloth is adopted to maintain a simple and comfortable lifestyle as far as possible. Its charm lies in the fact that once it is placed there, you can't help but want to sit on it. Once you sit on it, you will be warmly embraced by the full particles. In short, it can satisfy your needs most faithfully and completely in an instant. ""Leisure chair"" enjoys the fun of the New Year. The chair is perhaps one of the most dynamic and changeable home products, always bringing us a grand visual experience. Most of the furniture in the room, including display cabinets, TV cabinets, sofas, etc., will not be easily replaced. After a long time, they are inevitable to lack innovation. In the New Year's family dressing plan, several more exquisite leisure chairs will often magically become the focus of attention. In the beautiful season of the New Year, sitting alone on a romantic and casual chair, enjoying the beauty of life and the most comfortable home life. Leisure chairs have different choices in different spaces. The living room is a public area, very lively, so the leisure chair must be eye-catching with jumping colors and unique style, becoming a major landscape. At the same time, it should also make people sit comfortably and match the sofa properly. There are not many types of bedroom furniture. Adding a leisure chair in the bedroom is one of the ways for a person to adjust his mood. The leisure chair in the bedroom should match the bedroom environment. The color and style should not jump too much so as not to ""disturb"" the quiet space. The leisure chair in the study requires more functions and comfort."

It is reported that in the coming days, Can Yige will not only travel across the country to hold ""Can Yige Listening"" concert, but also warm up for the new album. At the Guangzhou concert of Fast Women on December 19, Can Yige is expected to appear in the new skirt style in the new album, and once again sing the classic song ""Leo"" after being rearranged. At the Shanghai concert of the Fast Women's Tour on October 7, when Can Yige sang the controversial song ""Leo"", he pointed to the sky and complained that he had not plagiarized, and said to the fans that it might be the last time to sing the song, because of the copyright problem, it might not be included in the personal album, which made many music fans who like the song feel sorry. But recently, when exposing the tracks of the new album, Can Yige's first main single was ""Leo"". Unlike the previous version, the new version of Leo was sprinkled with a simple whistle melody, and the simple melody gently spread in the ear, which still won the support of many fans. It seems that the re arranged ""Leo"" will still be the representative track of Can Yige. When accepting interviews from major media in recent days, Cao Yige wore a blue skirt, and the girlish dress gave off the children's breath of Cao Yige. Cao Yige not only expressed his sincere love for skirts, but also revealed that he hoped to take the sexy route after 25 years old, just like ""short-haired women can also be sexy and lovely"" in Leo. According to the performance party, at the Guangzhou concert on December 19, Cao Yige is expected to appear on the stage for the first time in a skirt and once again sing ""Leo"", while other fast women, such as Jiang Yingrong, Li Xiaoyun, and Huang Ying, will continue to bring more wonderful performances.

国信证券：银行挑梁关注中游证券通1.市场判断：加速上涨后的调整6月份市场在银行等权重板块推动下存在加速上涨可能，进而则可能引发真正的一轮调整，建议从补涨思路选择板块与个股，从而兼顾到策略性防御。2.行业配置：银行挑梁，关注中游本月最看好的三个行业依次为金融(银行、券商、保险)、钢铁、石油化工；前瞻性的看好钢铁、电解铝、化工、航运、造纸等中游行业中受益经济复苏、景气回升的行业。主要理由与逻辑：(1)息差拐点、估值洼地、流动性再泛滥、欧美经济与股市回升等利多因素将支撑金融尤其是银行板块上涨，进而推动指数繁荣。(2)前瞻性看好钢铁、电解铝、化工、航运、造纸等中游行业景气回升。因为这是实体经济真正复苏的重要判据。汽车地产两大先导性产业的复苏拉动经济走出谷底，2季度工业生产将持续回升，市场对于经济复苏的信心增强最终会引发资金增配钢铁等中游板块。(3)看好油价，谨慎对待煤炭、有色。欧美经济复苏态势基本确立，避险需求降低下的美元汇率走低推高商品市场，加上季节性因素，油价在3季度可相对乐观，有望推动化工等中游行业的产品价格。虽然我们对煤炭仍然看好，但在基金普遍超配和经历大幅上涨之后，新的机会需要等待到4季度，我们看好的大同煤业、平煤股份、盘江股份、中油化建则需要视资产注入事件的时点。有色板块业绩支撑较弱，不具备安全边际，建议逢高减持。(4)市场风格转换本质上是补涨行为，这也是提高投资组合防御性的一个重要因素，我们认为补涨的主要板块将集中在中游行业(钢铁、电解铝、化工、造纸、交通运输等)、消费品领域(食品饮料、商业)。3.个股选择策略与重点推荐组合自上而下，以及结合国信行业分析师自下而上的推荐，我们建议的6月份重点推荐组合为：建设银行、工商银行、招商银行、中国平安、辽宁成大、酒钢宏兴、鞍钢股份、中国联通、青岛海尔、华泰股份、辰州矿业、鑫科材料、云南城投、中天城投、山西三维、柳化股份、福耀玻璃、国阳新能、中国远洋、五粮液。		正向	Guoxin Securities: The bank selects the main beam to focus on the midstream securities pass 1. Market judgment: After the acceleration in June, the market may rise under the promotion of the banking and other weighted sectors, which may trigger a real round of adjustment. It is suggested to choose the sector and individual stocks from the perspective of making up the rise, so as to take both strategic defense into account. 2. Industry configuration: The bank selects the main beam and focuses on the midstream. The three industries I like best this month are finance (banking, securities, insurance), steel and petrochemical industry; Steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemical industry, shipping, paper and other midstream industries that benefit from economic recovery and rising prosperity are promising. Main reasons and logic: (1) The inflection point of interest spread, valuation depression, liquidity flooding again, the recovery of the US and European economy and stock market and other favorable factors will support the rise of the financial sector, especially the banking sector, and then promote the prosperity of the index. (2) Steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemical industry, shipping, paper and other midstream industries are promising in terms of recovery. Because this is an important criterion for the real recovery of the real economy. The recovery of the two leading industries of automobile and real estate will pull the economy out of the bottom, and industrial production will continue to rise in the second quarter. The market's confidence in economic recovery will eventually trigger increased funds to be allocated to the midstream sector such as steel. (3) Be optimistic about oil prices and cautious about coal and nonferrous metals. The recovery trend of the US and European economies has been basically established. The dollar exchange rate fell under the background of reduced risk aversion, pushing up the commodity market. Together with seasonal factors, oil prices can be relatively optimistic in the third quarter, and it is expected to promote the product prices of the midstream industry such as chemical industry. Although we are still optimistic about coal, after the general over allocation of funds and the experience of a substantial increase, the new opportunity needs to wait until the fourth quarter. The asset injection time point of Datong Coal Industry, Pingmei Shares, Panjiang Shares and Sinopec needs to be considered. The performance support of the nonferrous metal sector is weak and there is no safety margin. It is suggested to reduce the position when it is high. (4) The conversion of market style is essentially a complementary rising behavior, which is also an important factor in improving the defense of the investment portfolio. We believe that the main sectors of complementary growth will focus on the midstream industry (steel, electrolytic aluminum, chemical industry, paper, transportation) and the consumer goods sector (food and beverages, commerce). 3. Stock selection strategy and key recommendation combination From top to bottom, and in combination with the bottom-up recommendation of Guoxin Industry analysts, the key recommended combination we suggest for June is: China Construction Bank, ICBC, China Merchants Bank, Ping An of China, Liaoning Chengda, Jiu Steel Hongxing, Ansteel, China Unicom, Qingdao Haier, Huatai Stock, Chenzhou Mining, Xinkes Material, Yunnan Chengtou, Zhongtian Chengtou, Shanxi Three Dimension, Liu Hua Stock, Fuyao Glass, Guoyang New Energy, China Ocean Shipping, Wuliangye.

欧元区救援基金主管：欧元不会崩溃新浪财经讯北京时间11月25日晚间消息，欧元区救援基金主管克劳斯-雷格林(KlausRegling)表示，即便葡萄牙等其他国家步希腊和爱尔兰的后尘、要求救援，也不存在债务危机导致欧元崩溃的可能性。雷格林周四在一份德国报纸上发表了上述评论，称尽管欧元可能出现贬值，外围弱国所遭遇的困境不会危及欧元区16国所共同使用的货币。他说：“完全不存在这种危险。没有任何国家会自愿放弃欧元，对于弱国而言这么做无异于经济自杀，对于强国而言同样如此。”不过他表示同意德国总理安格拉-默克尔(AngelaMerkel)的看法，就欧元而言，欧洲的确“形势十分严峻”。法国和德国外长均作出信心表态，称他们的国家有能力向爱尔兰提供快速援助，就像今年早些时候对希腊那样。他们表示，爱尔兰最近的紧缩政策将有助于提升大家对欧元的信心。与此同时，他们发出警告，欧盟需要作出政策改进以预防其他国家陷入危机螺旋，同时建立危机发生后实施干预的机制。(诚之)	安格拉-默克尔,克劳斯-雷格林,雷格林,诚之	正向	"The head of the eurozone rescue fund: the euro will not collapse. Sina Finance News reported on the evening of November 25, Beijing time. Klaus Regling, the head of the eurozone rescue fund, said that the euro would not collapse due to the debt crisis, even if Portugal and other countries followed Greece and Ireland in seeking rescue. Regling made the above remarks in a German newspaper on Thursday, saying that although the euro may depreciate, the difficulties faced by the peripheral weak countries will not threaten the currency used by the 16 countries in the eurozone. He said: ""There is no danger at all. No country will voluntarily give up the euro. It is equivalent to economic suicide for the weak countries and the strong countries."" However, he agreed with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Angela Merkel) that the situation in Europe was ""very serious"" in terms of the euro. The French and German foreign ministers both made confident statements, saying that their countries were able to provide rapid assistance to Ireland, as they did to Greece earlier this year. They said that Ireland's recent austerity policy will help enhance people's confidence in the euro.

瑞星发布Q3网络钓鱼报告：网民损失超50亿元10月12日，瑞星发布《2010年第三季度网络钓鱼报告》，报告指出，现在每天出现1万余个新钓鱼网站，其中95%是由机器自动生成，传统反钓鱼技术很难识别。除了传统意义上的钓鱼网站之外，网络诈骗与客户端软件结合、甚至与传统电话诈骗结合，成为新型诈骗的显著特点，比如刷钻、刷信用等已经成为黑客赚钱常用的手法。瑞星安全专家指出，由于第三季度包括了暑假出游高峰及中秋假期，网民们通过网络订票、网络购物、上网游戏的交易量相对上升，所以造成其因钓鱼诈骗遭受的损失以及间接损失，比去年同期大幅上升，据估算可能高达50至70亿元。瑞星报告中也列举了一些案例，包括“QQ刷钻”、“淘宝刷信用”等新型钓鱼诈骗开始肆虐。但这些网站通常会直接骗取用户的手机话费和账户里的钱，因此危害性极大。而且这些活动本身就属于不合法的灰色地带，即使网民被骗，也往往会因为“干这个本来就不对”而忍气吞声。8月下旬，瑞星“云安全”系统的反钓鱼功能正式上线，并为“瑞星全功能安全软件2011测试版”提供智能反钓鱼的云端支持。自启用至今，共截获47万多个钓鱼网站(以URL计算)，比未启用前的拦截数量提高数十倍。从最新截获的钓鱼网站数据来看，约有20%的钓鱼网站寿命仅有一天，80%的钓鱼网站存活不超过一个星期。这就使得采用传统方式拦截钓鱼网站效果有限，有超过70%的钓鱼网站成为漏网之鱼。瑞星安全专家表示，即将推出的瑞星2011新版软件，将采用智能化的方式，根据钓鱼网站的颜色、布局、行为特征等进行判断，拦截有效率达90%以上。无论钓鱼网站怎么变化域名、怎么更改自己的特征，都逃不出瑞星的“慧眼”。“中奖骗局”等占钓鱼网站九成根据《瑞星报告》数据显示，本季度共截获55万个钓鱼网站(8月之前以传统方式截获8万余个)，且呈不断加速的趋势。其中，以“假中奖”及“假购物网站”等方式出现的钓鱼网站居多，占据总体数量的90%以上，而在涉及到具体事件时，某一类“李鬼”网站则会出现相应的“井喷”。比如，在新浪“微博一周年”活动期间冒出的大量“抽奖网站”，或者在暑运临近到来时，涌现的各种逼真的“航空公司官网”，这一类钓鱼网站制作精良，如果不仔细甄别地址，单从页面信息上很难分辨真伪。瑞星安全专家对每月新增的典型网站进行追踪监测发现，虽然钓鱼网站的数量及形式在不断增加，但网站的平均生存周期及点击次数却在逐步降低。目前，80%以上钓鱼网站存活不会超过一个星期，有的甚至只存活短短几个小时。这说明，随着“钓鱼手法”的持续曝光，人们的安全意识在不断提升，也促使钓鱼网站“与时俱进”地变换欺骗方式，以更加具有迷惑性的面貌出现。QQ刷钻是如何骗钱的著名的聊天软件QQ有多种会员级别，需要充值才可获得，有时候使用一定的技巧，可以在较短时间内升级为高级会员，享受更大的存储空间、QQ聊天记录在线存储等多种贴心服务。黑客利用网民急于升级为高级会员的心理，号称通过使用某种软件，可以利用腾讯系统的漏洞，在较短时间内少花钱甚至不花钱升级为高等级会员。在百度上搜索“QQ刷钻”，可以找到70万条结果，根据瑞星公司的监测，在搜索结果的第一页显著位置，就有所谓“QQ刷钻外挂”下载，这些软件有两种骗钱手法：第一种，直接在软件里捆绑木马，强制修改IE首页、弹出广告等，获取利益。这种手法在用户使用后很容易识破，现在不大常见。第二种手法则比较高明，用户运行“刷钻外挂”后，软件会提示“填入手机号即可升级到黄钻”等。实际上当你填入手机号后，会要求“开通某某套餐”，软件界面会狡辩说“套餐只是为了验证手机号真伪，不收取费用”，其实会收取名目繁多的各类套餐费用。		正向	"Rising released Q3 phishing report: netizens lost more than 5 billion yuan On October 12, Rising released the ""2010 Third Quarter Phishing Report"", which pointed out that now more than 10000 new phishing websites appear every day, 95% of which are automatically generated by machines, and traditional anti phishing technology is hard to identify. In addition to the traditional sense of phishing websites, online fraud combined with client software, and even combined with traditional telephone fraud, has become a significant feature of new fraud, such as brushing diamonds and brushing credits, which have become a common way for hackers to make money. Rising security experts pointed out that since the third quarter includes the peak summer travel and the Mid Autumn Festival holiday, the transaction volume of netizens through online ticket booking, online shopping and online games has risen relatively, causing their losses and indirect losses due to phishing fraud to rise sharply compared with the same period last year, and it is estimated that the loss may be as high as 5 billion to 7 billion yuan. The Rising Report also lists some cases, including the new type of phishing fraud such as ""QQ Brushing Drill"" and ""Taobao Credit Brushing"", which has begun to rage. But these websites usually directly defraud users' mobile phone bills and money in their accounts, so they are extremely harmful. Moreover, these activities themselves belong to the illegal gray area. Even if netizens are cheated, they will often hold their breath because ""this is not right in the first place"". In late August, the anti phishing function of the Rising ""Cloud Security"" system was officially launched, providing intelligent anti phishing cloud support for the ""Rising Full Function Security Software 2011 Test Edition"". Since its launch, a total of more than 470000 phishing websites (calculated by URL) have been seized, dozens of times more than the number of interceptions before its launch. From the latest data of the captured phishing websites, about 20% of the phishing websites only live for one day, and 80% of the phishing websites do not live more than a week. This makes it limited to intercept phishing websites in a traditional way, and more than 70% of the phishing websites become漏网之鱼. Rising security experts said that the new version of Rising 2011 to be launched will adopt an intelligent approach to judge the color, layout, behavior characteristics, etc. of the phishing website, with an interception success rate of more than 90%. No matter how the phishing website changes its domain name or how it changes its own characteristics, it can not escape the ""smart eye"" of Rising. According to the data of Rising Report, ""lottery fraud"" and other phishing websites account for 90% of the phishing websites. According to the data of Rising Report, a total of 550000 phishing websites (more than 80000 by traditional way before August) were captured this quarter, and the trend is accelerating continuously. Among them, the most common phishing websites are those that appear in the form of ""fake lottery"" and ""fake shopping websites"", accounting for more than 90% of the total number. When it comes to specific events, a certain kind of ""Li Gui"" website will have a corresponding ""gush"". For example, a large number of ""lottery websites"" that emerged during the ""Sina Weibo One Year"" event, or a variety of realistic ""airline official websites"" that emerged when the summer transport was coming near, this kind of phishing websites are well produced. If you don't carefully identify the address, it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity from the page information. Rising security experts found that although the number and form of phishing websites are increasing, the average survival cycle and click times of the websites are gradually decreasing by tracking and monitoring the typical websites added each month. At present, more than 80% of the phishing websites will not survive for more than a week, and some will only survive for a short time of hours. This shows that with the continuous exposure of ""fishing skills"", people's security awareness is constantly improving, which also promotes the phishing website to change its cheating method ""in line with the times"", so as to appear in a more confusing way. QQ Brushing Diamonds is a well-known chat software QQ, which has several member levels and requires recharge to obtain. Sometimes, using certain skills, you can upgrade to a senior member in a short time and enjoy a variety of considerate services, such as larger storage space and online storage of QQ chat records. Hackers take advantage of the fact that netizens are eager to upgrade to senior members, claiming that by using a certain software, they can use the vulnerability of Tencent's system to upgrade to a higher level member in a short time without spending money. By searching for ""QQ Brushing Drill"" on Baidu, you can find 700000 results. According to the monitoring of Rising Company, there is a so-called ""QQ Brushing Drill"" plug-in download in a prominent position on the first page of the search results. These software has two ways to make money: The first one is to directly bind the trojan in the software to force the modification of the IE home page, pop-up advertisements, etc. to make profits. This approach is easy for users to crack after use, and now it is less common. The second approach is more sophisticated. After the user runs the ""Brushing Drill Plug-in"", the software will prompt ""Enter the mobile phone number to upgrade to the Yellow Diamond"", etc. In fact, when you enter your mobile phone number, you will be asked to ""open a certain package"". The software interface will argue that ""the package is only for verifying the authenticity of the mobile phone number, and no fees are charged"", but it will actually charge various package expenses."

比人更懂地球Sprint定制LG环保Remarq文/王彬人们每天都在呼吁环保，更准确的说，应该是科学家时刻都在努力唤醒人们的环保意识，但是又有多少人真的听得进去，并且从以身作则地有实际行动呢？如果被问到，你了解地球有多少？你是否真的了解低碳生活？如果一部手机可以计算人一天所产生的二氧化碳量，并且与植物排放入大气的比较，你是否会购买呢？如果答案是肯定的，这部Sprint定制的LG环保手机Remarq再合适不过了。除能够实现上述功能外，Remarq自身也是做到了彻头彻尾的环保。机身部分由可回收的塑料材质组成，整体可回收物料的利用率超过87%。甚至连机器的包装盒都是从废纸再利用做成，包装内没有纸质说明书，用户可在线查找相关资料。不过手机仍配备了滑盖式QWERTY键盘，并配有130万像素摄像头，以及QVGA屏幕。回到刚刚的问题，这样一部手机你会购买吗？为了环保，整机可以说是基本上都是回收废料再提炼而成，所以运营商也明智地将其定位在两年合约零消费的水平。真心希望可以唤醒人们丧失多年的环保概念，手机将在5月9日正式发布。		正向	Sprint custom LG environmental Remarq Wen/Wang Bin People call for environmental protection every day, or more accurately, scientists are always trying to awaken people's environmental awareness. But how many people really listen and take concrete actions as an example? If you are asked, how much do you know about the earth? Do you really know the low carbon life? If a mobile phone can calculate the amount of carbon dioxide generated by a person in a day and compare it with the emission of plants into the atmosphere, will you buy it? If the answer is yes, this Sprint customized LG green mobile phone Remarq is just right. In addition to being able to achieve the above functions, Remarq itself has also achieved thorough environmental protection. The fuselage is made up of recyclable plastic materials, and the utilization rate of recyclable materials as a whole exceeds 87%. Even the machine's packing box is made from recycled waste paper, and there is no paper manual in the package. Users can search for relevant information online. However, the mobile phone is still equipped with a sliding QWERTY keyboard, a 1.3 million pixel camera, and a QVGA screen. Back to the question just now, will you buy such a mobile phone? In order to protect the environment, the whole machine can be basically recycled and refined, so the operator also wisely positioned it at the level of zero consumption in two years. I sincerely hope that people can be awakened from the lost environmental concept for many years, and the mobile phone will be officially released on May 9
个性选手屡遭淘汰红歌会被质疑缺乏原创(图)新浪娱乐讯业内唯一一个国字头的选秀节目中国红歌会眼下已经结束了全国晋级赛第一部分的比拼，胜出的全国12强选手目前正在南昌进行周日(8月2日)红歌英雄汇第一场的准备。然而，眼下这个以重温经典为主的歌会却因淘汰个性选手而遭到缺乏原创性的质疑。个性选手纷纷败北经过了三年的举办，今年在这个被认为受中老年观众追捧的节目中出现了更多八零后九零后选手。在他们中，有主修声乐的科班生，也有不少走所谓“民族通俗”路线的酒吧歌手。尽管老评委们一再称自己很高兴看到年轻人唱红歌，然而这些给被观众称为“有想法”的歌手经过了几轮的淘汰之后却纷纷离开舞台。将《飞得更高》、《奔跑》等作品中融入新元素的叮当组合在第一轮比赛中就惨遭淘汰，而改编经典《小河淌水》为灵魂乐版本的梁凡在突围战第二场也败下阵来。老歌新唱遭反对红歌会被质疑缺乏原创流行红歌手纷纷败北遭到了不少年轻观众的不满，这些新红歌演唱者实力不俗又有想法，被淘汰实在不应该，可这些受年轻观众追捧的个性选手在老评委处却没有得到太高的评价。叮当组合等选手在海选时就曾被评委指出随意改编老歌是对原作者的不敬，梁凡在彩排时还曾被工作人员要求换歌。就此，评委蒋大为在沈阳赛区接受采访时曾表示，新红歌不是改编老的作品，而是写出真正反映这个时代的原创作品。事实上，认为红歌需要原创的不止评委蒋大为一人，最近就有业界人士指出红歌会鼓励选手演唱经典，没有原创作品产生，节目本身不具市场化。不过也有人认为，喜欢红歌的人大多是些思想正统生活态度积极的观众，重温经典的理念刚好迎合了他们的口味。据红歌会栏目组一位工作人员称，周日在江西电视台进行的红歌英雄会第一场中，大部分歌手还是会选择演唱经典老歌，但也不排除个别选手演唱原创作品的可能性。(大拇指)	梁凡,蒋大为	负向	"The personality contestant is frequently eliminated. The Red Song Conference, the only Chinese word in the industry, has ended the first part of the national promotion competition. The top 12 winners in China are currently preparing for the first round of the Red Song Hero Conference in Nanchang on Sunday (August 2). However, the song festival, which is mainly about reviewing classics, has been questioned for lack of originality because of the elimination of personality contestants. After three years of holding, there were more post-80s and post-90s contestants in this program, which is considered to be popular among middle-aged and elderly viewers. Among them, there are music majors and many bar singers who follow the so-called ""national popular"" route. Although the old judges repeatedly said that they were happy to see young people sing red songs, these singers who were called ""thoughtful"" by the audience left the stage after several rounds of elimination. The Dangdang team, which integrates new elements into works such as ""Flying Higher"" and ""Running"", was unfortunately eliminated in the first round, and Liang Fan, who adapted the classic ""Small River Water"" into a soul music version, also lost in the second round of the breakout war. The old song was opposed. The popular red singers were defeated, which caused a lot of young viewers to complain. These new red song singers are very talented and have ideas. It is really unfair to eliminate them. However, these individual contestants favored by young viewers did not get too high evaluation from the old judges. Dangdang and other contestants were once pointed out by the judges to randomly改编old songs as a disrespect to the original author. Liang Fan was also asked by the staff to change songs during the rehearsal. In this regard, Judge Jiang Dawei said in an interview in Shenyang that the new red song is not to rewrite the old works, but to write the original works that truly reflect this era. In fact, Judge Jiang Dawei is not the only one who thinks that red songs need creation. Recently, industry insiders have pointed out that the Red Song Conference encourages contestants to sing classics without creating original works, and the program itself is not marketable. However, some people also believe that those who like red songs are mostly viewers with orthodox ideology and positive life attitude, and the concept of reviewing classics just caters to their taste. According to a staff member of the Red Song Conference column group, most singers will still choose to sing classic old songs in the first round of the Red Song Hero Conference held by Jiangxi TV on Sunday, but it is not ruled out that some contestants will sing original works.

李天一打人未满18周岁尚不具备承担刑责条件本报记者叶涵在这起事件中，李双江(微博)之子李天一未满18周岁，但涉嫌寻衅滋事和故意伤害，且因没有取得驾照还涉嫌无照驾驶。而李双江梦鸽夫妇作为李天一的监护人，在这起事件中又需承担怎样的法律责任呢？网上就此议论纷纷，各种说法都有，昨天记者请教了浙联律师事务所主任戴和平律师。北京海淀警方昨日发给媒体的声明称，苏某、李某因涉嫌寻衅滋事罪已被海淀公安分局依法拘留，目前正在进一步审理中。戴和平律师介绍，寻衅滋事罪，是指在公共场所无事生非，起哄闹事，殴打伤害无辜，肆意挑衅，横行霸道，破坏公共秩序的行为。如被证实，可处5年以下有期徒刑、拘役或者管制。如是14周岁以上却未满18周岁的未成年人，则可以从轻或减轻处罚。但《刑法》同时规定，已满14周岁不满16周岁的人，只对犯故意杀人、故意伤害致人重伤或者死亡、强奸、抢劫、贩卖毒品、放火、爆炸、投毒罪的，负刑事责任，其他的不构成刑事责任。根据现有资料，李天一出生于1996年4月，到今年的9月刚好是15周岁多5个月，不满16周岁，因此假如其出生年月无误，则不用承担刑事责任。李双江夫妇可能被追究民事责任戴律师表示，在此案中，受害者可以向李天一的监护人即李双江及梦鸽追究民事责任，伤者可索取民事赔偿，包括医药费、误工费、营养费及精神损失费等。此外，李天一肇事时无证驾驶宝马车也成为焦点。一位知情者称，车先前是李双江妻子梦鸽的，是一辆白色宝马。今年5月份，他曾陪同李双江之子在“宝马亿佰欧改装俱乐部”进行改装，变成了以黑色为主体，橘色镶边的改装豪车，改装费用约27万元。根据法律规定，改变车身颜色、更换发动机、车身或者车架，未在变更后10日内向车辆管理所申请变更登记的，由公安机关交通管理部门处警告或者200元以下罚款；擅自改变机动车外形和已登记的有关技术数据的，由公安机关交通管理部门责令恢复原状，并处警告或者500元以下罚款。由于未成年人不得考取驾照，李天一属于无照驾驶，根据规定可由公安交通管理部门处200元以上2000元以下的罚款，可以并处15日以下拘留。	叶涵,李天一,戴和平,李双江,苏某,梦鸽	负向	"In this case, Li Tianyi, the son of Li Shuangjiang (microblog), was under 18 years old, but he was suspected of寻衅滋事and intentional injury, and he was also suspected of driving without a license because he did not obtain a driver's license. Li Shuangjiang and Meng Ge, as Li Tianyi's guardian, what legal responsibility should they bear in this incident? There has been a lot of discussion on the Internet about this, and all kinds of opinions have been expressed. Yesterday, the reporter consulted Dai Heping, the director of Zhelian Law Firm. The statement sent by the Beijing Haidian police to the media yesterday said that Su and Li had been detained by the Haidian Public Security Branch on suspicion of the crime of寻衅滋事, and they are being further tried. Lawyer Dai Heping introduced that the crime of寻衅滋事refers to the act of causing trouble for no reason in public places, making a fuss, beating and injuring the innocent, wantonly provoking, bullying and disrupting public order. If verified, he can be sentenced to less than 5 years' imprisonment, criminal detention or public security. If a minor aged 14 years old but under 18 years old, he/she may be given a lighter or lesser punishment. However, the Criminal Law also stipulates that those who have reached the age of 14 but not yet 16 years old will only be held criminally responsible for intentional killing, intentional injury causing serious injury or death, rape, robbery, drug trafficking, arson, explosion and poisoning. According to the existing data, Li Tianyi was born in April 1996. It was exactly 15 years and 5 months old in September of this year, less than 16 years old. Therefore, if his birth date is correct, he will not be held criminally responsible. Lawyer Dai said that in this case, the victim could hold Li Tianyi's guardian, Li Shuangjiang and Mengge, civil liable, and the injured could claim civil compensation, including medical expenses, miswork expenses, nutrition expenses and mental damage expenses. In addition, Li Tianyi's driving of the BMW car without a license when he was at fault also became the focus. An informed person said that the car was Meng Ge, Li Shuangjiang's wife, and it was a white BMW. In May of this year, he accompanied Li Shuangjiang's son to modify the ""BMW Yibai Europe改装Club"", which became a modified luxury car with black as the main body and orange edging, with a modification cost of about 270000 yuan. According to the law, if the body color of the vehicle is changed, the engine, body or chassis is replaced, and the vehicle management department is not applied for change registration within 10 days after the change, the public security traffic management department shall give a warning or a fine of less than 200 yuan; If the外形of the motor vehicle is changed or the relevant technical data that have been registered is changed without authorization, the public security traffic management department shall order the restoration to the original status and give a warning or a fine of less than 500 yuan. Since minors are not allowed to take the driver's license examination, Li Tianyi is driving without a license. According to the regulations, the public security traffic management department can give a fine of more than 200 yuan and less than 2000 yuan, and may be detained for less than 15 days."

美联储维持0-0.25%基准利率区间不变新浪财经讯北京时间1月28日凌晨3点15分，美联储在结束为期两天的利率会议后宣布，维持0-0.25%的基准利率区间不变。此举符合市场的普遍预期。联邦公开市场委员会(FOMC)在会后发表的政策声明指出，预计将在较长时间内维持超低利率政策，将在三月底终止采购抵押贷款支持证券项目。此外，与上一份声明相比，联储对经济前景的判断略微乐观一些。联储还称，将在三月结束针对银行的信贷拍卖项目。一些分析师评论道，在为期两天的闭门会议中，联储官员在利率和经济前景方面上有许多问题要谈论，但他们在公开场合不会发表太多言论。联储前董事劳伦斯-迈耶(LaurenceMeyer)称：“从联储将采取何种行动的角度看，这可能是一次平淡无奇的会议，但从其他角度看它又特别令人感兴趣。”巴克莱资本的经济学家迪安-马基(DeanMaki)表示，联储主席伯南克第二任期提名引发的争议只会让联储变得更低调。本周四参院将就是否批准伯南克连任进行表决。市场分析师普遍预期奥巴马总统对伯南克再任联储主席的提名将获得通过。另一个令人感兴趣的问题是美国经济的前景。联储官员早已表示，他们并不认为失业率在短期内会有太大改善。多数经济学家认为，在劳动力市场出现明显的改善迹象之后联储才可能启动紧缩政策。因此，分析人士普遍预期FOMC在会后声明中将再度强调联邦基金利率有必要在相当长一段时间内维持在历史超低水平。多数联储观察家认为，今天联储将重申多数特别流动性工具将于2月1日终止，此外联储可能声明采购1.25万亿美元抵押贷款支持证券的计划将按原计划于3月底结束。联储观察家还表示，在声明无重大变化的表象之下可能掩藏着联储官员对退出策略的激烈争论。FOMC在12月上一次会议的声明中曾指出，将在“未来的会议上讨论在较长期内推行货币政策的替代性措施”。观察家认为，这无异于公开了一个秘密：现在联储官员还不清楚最优的退出方案是什么。	迪安-马基,马基,伯南克,奥巴马,DeanMaki,LaurenceMeyer,劳伦斯,迈耶,劳伦斯-迈耶,迪安	正向	"The Federal Reserve maintained the benchmark interest rate range of 0-0.25% Sina Finance News reported at 3:15 a.m. Beijing time on January 28. The Federal Reserve announced after the two-day interest rate meeting that it would maintain the benchmark interest rate range of 0-0.25%. This move is in line with the general expectation of the market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) pointed out in its policy statement after the meeting that it is expected to maintain the ultra-low interest rate policy for a long time, and the mortgage-backed securities purchase project will end at the end of March. In addition, the Fed's judgment on the economic prospects is slightly more optimistic than the previous statement. The Fed also said that the credit auction project targeting banks will end in March. Some analysts commented that Fed officials had many issues to discuss on interest rates and economic prospects at the two-day closed-door meeting, but they would not say much in public. Laurence Meyer, a former Fed director, said: ""This may be an uneventful meeting from the perspective of what the Fed will do, but it is particularly interesting from other perspectives."" Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital, said that the controversy caused by Bernanke's nomination for a second term as Fed chairman would only make the Fed more low-key. The Senate will vote on Thursday on whether to approve Bernanke's reappointment. Market analysts generally expect that President Obama's nomination of Bernanke for another term as Fed chairman will be approved. Another interesting issue is the prospect of the U.S. economy. Fed officials have long said that they do not think the unemployment rate will improve much in the short term. Most economists believe that the Federal Reserve will not start the tightening policy until there are obvious signs of improvement in the labor market. Therefore, analysts generally expect that the FOMC will again emphasize in its statement after the meeting that the federal funds rate needs to remain at a historically ultra-low level for a considerable period of time. Most Fed observers believe that the Fed will reiterate today that most special liquidity tools will end on February 1, and the Fed may also declare that the $1.25 trillion mortgage-backed securities purchase plan will end at the end of March as scheduled. Fed observers also said that there may be a fierce debate among Fed officials on the exit strategy under the appearance that there is no significant change in the statement. The FOMC pointed out in its statement at the last meeting in December that ""alternative measures to implement monetary policy for a long time will be discussed at future meetings"". Observers believe that this is no different from revealing a secret: Fed officials do not know what is the best exit plan at present."

据称深圳反腐行动可能牵涉一大批开发商2005年至2009年，深圳房价暴涨的四年里，有几位民营地产商人格外引人注目，其中三人是星河地产集团董事长黄楚龙、卓越地产集团董事长李华、京基地产公司董事长陈华。他们可以以协议出让等非常规手段在深圳市中心地段拿地，在深圳房价暴涨过程中受益颇多，因此身处深圳地产的风暴眼中。中心区拿地高手黄楚龙本报记者张睿发自深圳深圳房地产界的大腕儿中，不得不提星河地产的董事长黄楚龙。这位习惯别人称他为“龙哥”，总自称“潮州佬”的地产商人，从1979年到深圳做工程创业至今，已经成为深圳中心城区数一数二的“大哥”。坊间传言，黄楚龙眼下已离开了深圳。时代周报记者多次寻访黄楚龙，6月12日上午，在星河地产公司，只见其办公室门开着，门口留有一双拖鞋。记者立即拨打其手机，但直至截稿时，黄楚龙的电话一直都被转至语音信箱，黄楚龙杳无音信。过江猛龙黄楚龙星河地产在深圳赫赫有名。深圳的出租车司机，说起星河的项目都如数家珍。“星河的房子都卖得很好，因为地段特别好。”21世纪不动产(21世纪不动产博客)的一位经纪人告诉时代周报记者，“黄老板实力很强，总能在中心城区拿到好地。”深圳地铁一号线CBD核心区的三个地铁站周边，聚集了星河地产开发的四个项目。同许多地产商的发展历程相似，黄楚龙也是从建筑工人起家的。1979年，他在深圳建特区伊始就前来创业，“泥水匠”的活儿做得风生水起，后来慢慢开始做起包工头，承接了深圳第一大道深南大道(上海宾馆至上步路)的建设工程。靠着做包工头淘得的第一桶金，1998年，黄楚龙成立了深圳怡和企业公司，即星河地产的前身。黄楚龙摇身一变，成为一个开发商。1994年4月，黄楚龙成立深圳市新怡和实业发展有限公司，先后开发了祥和花园、怡和楼、海悦华城等多个项目。1999年12月，新怡和更名为深圳市星河房地产开发有限公司。深圳著名房地产评论员“图腾镜”，在其博客上记录了万科集团董事长王石(王石博客)、星河地产董事长黄楚龙和世联地产(世联地产博客)顾问股份有限公司董事长陈劲松在一次饭桌上的“论道”。席间，陈劲松感叹，深圳民营房地产企业都没能走出去时，黄楚龙马上产生共鸣：“不错，我也走过很多城市。深有感触的是：人生地不熟，水土又不服。中午喝5斤白酒，晚上还要喝6斤，再喝下去，命都要陪进去了，故而不得不撤。”就是这位在其他城市“人生地不熟”的商人，却将其在深圳的地产事业经营得如鱼得水。“在深圳，万科、招商等上市公司往往拿不到中心区的地块，中心区的地块都被几个深圳的民营房企垄断了。”深圳某大型房地产企业的负责人向时代周报记者透露。黄楚龙的星河，就是这几家“中心区垄断大户”之一。2002年，位于福华三路和滨河大道之间的星河国际顺利开售，让黄楚龙真正在深圳中心区站稳了脚跟。到2005年，星河地产的项目全面开花。并赶上了2005-2007年，深圳房价飞涨的好时候。根据深圳地产咨询机构香地#zhPoint#半求工作室的统计分析，在深圳的CBD,每100平方米商品建筑中，就有12平方米是星河地产供应的。“官司门”抖落前生事同其他地产商相比，星河的土地储备不算多，却贵在“稀缺”。在藏龙卧虎的深圳地产界，这条过江猛龙能够击败众多对手，选地的眼光和拿地的能力自然不言而喻。2003年2月，黄楚龙在深圳首次进行的土地拍卖会上，以1.8亿元的总价、免息8年分期付款的方式，将如今的星河发展中心和丽思#zhPoint#卡尔顿项目一举拿下。2003年12月23日，黄楚龙又突然将目光放到关外，以2.5亿元的价格拍下龙岗区一幅17万平方米的地块。如今，地块所在的龙岗中心城，正在以规划中龙岗政治、经济、文化中心的身份大兴土木。黄楚龙拿地的能力不止于雄厚的资金实力。时代周报记者查阅深圳国土房管局的资料发现，黄楚龙在中心区大获成功的星河国际和星河世纪两个项目，权属来源均为“协议出让”。其中，星河国际项目的取得时间是1999年。而星河世纪大厦的受让日期是2004年9月13日，权属来源也是协议出让。2004年8月31日土地大限后，所有经营性用地都要通过招、拍、挂方式转让，星河是如何以协议出让的方式获得星河世纪大厦项目的用地呢？就在时代周报记者多方查证之时，6月16日，一宗以星河世纪大厦为标的物的案件，在福田区人民法院公开审理。黄楚龙获得星河世纪项目的相关情节，在这个案件中若隐若现。时代周报记者悉，星河世纪地块原属深圳市“还地于民”政策涉及的地块之一，使用权属于岗厦实业股份有限公司。2000年3月，由东永峰公司牵线搭桥，深圳岗厦与锦峰公司和东永峰公司签署了一份合作开发的协议，由岗厦公司提供商住用地，东永峰公司和锦峰公司提供建设资金，联合开发该地块。建成后岗厦公司分得物业11000平方米，其余物业归东永峰公司和锦峰公司所有。但在开发建设过程中，却陡生变数。按照原告方锦峰公司86名员工和股东的说法，2004年1月13日，锦峰公司的法定代表人同东永峰公司和岗厦公司签订协议，退出了该地块的开发。2004年1月12日，东永峰公司将这个项目转给了星河地产。原告方认为，锦峰公司法定代表人未召开董事会和股东会，未听取工会和职工意见就退出该项目的开发，且仅仅收回前期投资成本，让一个原本可以盈利的项目在开发中途拱手让人，造成了锦峰员工和股东的经济损失；且认为在项目操作中，包括锦峰公司的大股东深圳市福田投资发展公司、东永峰公司、锦峰公司法定代表人等几名被告有恶意串通的行为，遂将其悉数告上法庭；而福田区人民政府，也被原告认为支持并促成其他被告的侵权行为而成为又一被告。案情线索复杂、扑朔迷离。至今深圳市国土房管局的资料仍然显示星河世纪项目开发企业是深圳东永峰实业有限公司，而星河地产如何介入、通过协议出让方式获得星河世纪项目的细节，还是一个谜。星河地产总经理刘世成对时代周报记者表示：“他对此事并不清楚。”黄楚龙的江湖情结深圳地产界的人士说起这位“龙哥”，总免不了豪爽、重义气、朋友多、人脉广这些评价。黄楚龙的江湖情结，也奠定了他在圈子内的地位。深圳市工商局公开资料显示，黄楚龙最早成立的怡和企业公司，就有深圳市福田区沙头街道办事处以主管单位的身份作股东。黄楚龙的豪气，不仅体现在做地产项目上，关于其子2007年豪华婚礼的描述和图片在网上流传甚广。黄楚龙的一位老乡还爆料，黄楚龙邀请了村里大约500人去酒店大吃一顿，并且还给每人封了400元的红包，被网友们称为“史上最牛婚礼”。熟悉黄楚龙的人都发现，他的手腕和脖颈上都挂着佛珠。有知情人士透露：“黄老板一方面是会赚钱的商人，另一方面是礼佛散财的信徒。”黄楚龙经营企业的理念也时常为业内津津乐道。时代周报记者探访星河地产在星河发展中心17-24层的新总部时，发现贴在不同楼层的黄氏语录—“你好、我好、大家好，才是真的好”；“先做人，后做事，外圆而内方”。我要评论	陈劲松,黄楚龙,王石,李华,刘世成,黄老板,张睿,陈华	正向	"It is reported that the anti-corruption campaign in Shenzhen may involve a large number of developers. From 2005 to 2009, when the housing prices in Shenzhen soared for four years, several private real estate businessmen were particularly eye-catching, including Huang Chulong, Chairman of Xinghe Real Estate Group, Li Hua, Chairman of Excellence Real Estate Group, and Chen Hua, Chairman of Beijing Base Real Estate Company. They can take unconventional means such as land acquisition by agreement to get land in the central area of Shenzhen, and benefit a lot from the process of sharp rise in housing prices in Shenzhen, so they are in the eye of the storm of real estate in Shenzhen. Zhang Rui, a reporter from Shenzhen, a land acquisition expert in the central area, has to mention Huang Chulong, the chairman of Xinghe Real Estate, a big shot in the real estate industry of Shenzhen. This real estate developer, who is used to be called ""Brother Long"" by others and always calls himself ""Chaozhou Lad"", has become the top ranking ""big brother"" in the central urban area of Shenzhen since he started his engineering career in Shenzhen in 1979. It is rumored that Huang Chulong has left Shenzhen. Reporters of Time Weekly have visited Huang Chulong many times. On the morning of June 12, at Xinghe Real Estate Company, his office door was open and a pair of slippers was left at the door. The reporter immediately dialed his mobile phone, but until the press release, Huang Chulong's phone was always transferred to the voice mailbox, and Huang Chulong was missing. Huang Chulong, a fierce dragon crossing the river, is well-known in Shenzhen. Taxi drivers in Shenzhen talk about Xinghe's projects as if they were treasures of their own family. ""Xinghe's houses sell well because they are in a special location."" A broker of 21st Century Real Estate (21st Century Real Estate Blog) told the reporter of Time Weekly that ""Boss Huang is very powerful and can always get good land in the central city area."" Around the three subway stations in the CBD core area of Shenzhen Metro Line 1, there are four projects developed by Xinghe Real Estate. Similar to the development experience of many real estate developers, Huang Chulong also started from a construction worker. In 1979, at the beginning of the construction of Shenzhen Special Zone, he came to start his business. The ""mason's"" job was very popular. Later, he slowly began to act as a contractor and undertook the construction project of Shenzhen's first大道深南路 (Shanghai Hotel to Shangbu Road). With the first pot of gold made as a contractor, in 1998, Huang Chulong founded Shenzhen Yihua Enterprise Company, the predecessor of Xinghe Real Estate. Huang Chulong transforms himself into a developer. In April 1994, Huang Chulong established Shenzhen Xinyue Industrial Development Co., Ltd., which has successively developed a number of projects such as Xianghe Garden, Yihua Building, and Haiyue Huacheng. In December 1999, Xinyuehe was renamed Shenzhen Xinghe Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. Shen Zhen, a well-known real estate commentator in Shenzhen, recorded on his blog that Wang Shi (Wang Shi Blog), chairman of Vanke Group, Huang Chulong, chairman of Xinghe Real Estate, and Chen Jinsong, chairman of Sino Union Real Estate (Sino Union Real Estate Blog) had a ""discussion"" at a dinner table. During the dinner, Chen Jinsong lamented that when Shenzhen's private real estate enterprises were unable to go out, Huang Chulong immediately resonated: ""Yes, I have been to many cities. I'm not familiar with the land and water. I had five catties of white wine for lunch and another six catties in the evening. If I drink it again, I will have to give my life away, so I have to withdraw."" It is this businessman who is ""unfamiliar with life and death"" in other cities, but his real estate career in Shenzhen is like a fish in water. ""In Shenzhen, listed companies such as Vanke and China Merchants often can't get land in the central area, and the land in the central area is monopolized by several private real estate enterprises in Shenzhen."" Shen Zhen, a leader of a large real estate enterprise in Shenzhen, revealed to the reporter of Time Weekly. Huang Chulong's Xinghe is one of the major land monopolizers in the central area. In February 2003, Huang Chulong, at the first land auction in Shenzhen, won the Xinghe Development Center and Ritz#zhPoint#Carlton projects at a total price of 180 million yuan and an interest free installment payment for 8 years. On December 23, 2003, Huang Chulong suddenly focused on the land outside the pass, and took a 170000 square meter land in Longgang District at the price of 250 million yuan. At present, Longgang Central City, where the land is located, is building a lot of land as the planned political, economic and cultural center of Longgang. Huang Chulong's ability to acquire land goes beyond his strong financial strength. The data from Shenzhen Land and Housing Administration Department found by the reporter of Time Weekly shows that the two projects of Huang Chulong, Xinghe International and Xinghe Century, which have been successfully developed in the central area, are ""agreement transfer"". Among them, the Xinghe International project was obtained in 1999. The acquisition date of Xinghe Century Building is September 13, 2004, and the source of rights is also an agreement to transfer. After the land deadline on August 31, 2004, all land for business purposes must be transferred through bidding, shooting and hanging. How did Xinghe obtain the land for the Xinghe Century Building project in the way of agreement transfer? When the reporter of Time Weekly was verifying from all sides, on June 16, a case with Xinghe Century Building as the subject was publicly heard in Futian District Court. Huang Chulong's relevant plot of winning the Xinghe Century project is looming in this case. The reporter of Time Weekly learned that the Xinghe Century plot was one of the plots involved in the ""land return to the people"" policy of Shenzhen, and the right to use was owned by Gangxia Industrial Stock Co., Ltd. In March 2000, at the invitation of Dongyongfeng Company, Shenzhen Gangxia signed a cooperation and development agreement with Jinfeng Company and Dongyongfeng Company, under which Gangxia Company provided commercial and residential land, and Dongyongfeng Company and Jinfeng Company provided construction funds to jointly develop the land. After completion, Gangxia Company gets 11000 square meters of property, and the rest of the property belongs to Dongyongfeng Company and Jinfeng Company. But there are many variables in the process of development and construction. According to the plaintiff, 86 employees and shareholders of Jinfeng Company, on January 13, 2004, the legal representative of Jinfeng Company signed an agreement with Dongyongfeng Company and Gangxia Company to withdraw from the development of the land. On January 12, 2004, Dongyongfeng transferred the project to Xinghe Real Estate. The plaintiff believes that the legal representative of Jinfeng Company withdrew from the development of the project without convening the board of directors and the shareholders' meeting, and without listening to the opinions of the trade union and employees, and only recovered the investment cost in the early stage, which handed over a project that could originally make a profit to others in the middle of development, causing economic losses to Jinfeng employees and shareholders; and it is believed that in the project operation, several defendants, including the major shareholder Shenzhen Futian Investment Development Company, Dongyongfeng Company, and the legal representative of Jinfeng Company, had malicious collusion, so they filed a lawsuit against them; Futian District People's Government, was also regarded as another defendant because it supported and promoted the infringement of other defendants. The case is complicated and confusing. Up to now, the data of Shenzhen Land and Housing Administration Department still shows that the development enterprise of Xinghe Century Project is Shenzhen Dongyongfeng Industrial Co., Ltd., and how Xinghe Real Estate became involved and obtained the details of Xinghe Century Project through the agreement transfer is still a mystery. Liu Shicheng, general manager of Xinghe Real Estate, said to the reporter of Time Weekly: ""I don't know about this matter."" Huang Chulong's江湖in the real estate industry of Shenzhen When people talk about this ""Brother Long"", they always praise him for being generous, righteous, having many friends and wide contacts. Huang Chulong's江湖in the real estate industry of Shenzhen also laid the foundation for his status in the circle. The public information of Shenzhen Industry and Commerce Bureau shows that the earliest Yihua Enterprise Company established by Huang Chulong has the Sha Tou Street Office of Futian District, Shenzhen as a shareholder in the capacity of the competent unit.

Gold Online News Police set up a card at the toll station to check for drugs. A man and a woman were caught on a passenger bus. Finally, they followed the藤to find their online and online lines. Surprisingly, one of the drug traffickers was a judicial police officer. Recently, the Intermediate Court of Guiyang City tried the case and made a first instance announcement. At around 14:00 on November 24, 2007, the police in Guiyang set up a card at the Guiyang Jinguan Toll Station to check and stop. On a coach from Liupanshui to Guiyang, 410 grams of heroin was found on a woman, and another man, Hu Yuanjie (a native of Zijin County, 57 years old), who was traveling with the woman, was also caught. After Hu Yuanjie was arrested, he said he was willing to take credit and help the public security organ catch his online Yunnan people Tie Fa Cui and Ma Yuhuo. At about 10:00 am on November 29, in a hotel on Baojian Road, Ludian County, Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province, Tie Fecui and Ma Yuhuo, who were engaged in drug trafficking, were arrested by the public security personnel, and 468 grams of drugs were seized on the spot. Later, the police, based on the clues provided by Hu Yuanjie, arrested the drug dealer Wang Dehui at a hotel in Xishan District, Kunming City at about 14:00 on December 2, and seized 3050 grams of drugs. After Wang Dehui was arrested, he voluntarily explained that the 3050 grams of heroin he sold was given to him by a man named Ning Gongwei for sale. At that time, it was agreed that Wang Dehui would look for buyers. After the drug was sold, Wang Dehui would pay 7.5 million yuan to Ning Gongwei as a benefit fee for Wang Dehui. Ning Gongwei asked Wang Dehui to put 750000 yuan of drug money into two bank cards respectively, and send the card numbers of the two bank cards to Wang Dehui by mobile phone text message. With the cooperation of Wang Dehui, the public security officers caught Ning Gongwei in Lincang City, Yunnan Province on the afternoon of March 7, 2008. After investigation, Ning Gongwei was a judicial police officer of the Judicial Bureau of Gengma County, Lincang City, Yunnan Province. According to Ning Gongwei, in November 2007, he discussed with Wang Dehui about the sale of heroin. The heroin was obtained from a Myanmar.

专家：火箭腾空有三大隐患姚明不再受伤将是奇迹新浪体育讯　北京时间12月5日消息，star-telegram.com报道，综合现有信息，仔细地负责任地预测：休斯顿火箭将会以西部第五结束这个常规赛。火箭休赛期收获罗恩-阿泰斯特后，这种预测与那些膨胀的言论大相径庭，你知道，某些所谓专家看好这支球队能挺进总决赛。现在的火箭，看上去深受一个问题的困扰，那就是伤病。早在火箭的训练营期间，就有消息说经历过职业生涯首次手术后，麦蒂的膝盖仍然很疼。过去的四场比赛，麦蒂就因这个问题高挂免战牌。而且，据最新消息显示，这个7届全明星球员在接下来三周，都不会出现在球场上。过去三个赛季，麦蒂总共缺席了62场比赛。毋庸讳言，麦蒂是他这个年代最具才华的篮球运动员，但是在29岁这个年龄——或许，你会惊讶他竟然是如此年轻，经历过11个NBA赛季的敲打后，他已经伤病缠身。当麦蒂18岁以高中生身份进入这个联盟后，谁会想到11年之后的他会是今天这个样子。除了麦蒂的膝伤，火箭的另外两员主将姚明和阿泰斯特也各有麻烦，前者是脚，后者是头，其中任何一个“发作”，火箭的前景都不容乐观。过去三年，因为不同部位的伤病，姚明总共缺席了86场比赛。作为一个7尺6寸310磅的中锋，当姚明来回奔跑不断起跳时，他的身体承受着常人难以想象的压力。上赛季，姚明因为舟骨骨折错失了35场比赛，在火箭最需要他的时候赛季报销。手术后没过多长时间，姚明就超负荷运转，代表他的祖国参加了北京奥运会。所以，如果这个赛季姚明能全勤，那将是一个奇迹。再说说阿泰斯特。必须承认，阿泰斯特不缺乏天赋，他可以在攻防两端都打出统治级的表现，可在他的职业生涯里，他却时而弄出打架、虐待动物、为了宣传唱片而请假等麻烦事。麦蒂的膝、姚明的脚和阿泰斯特的头，这三个因素叠加，使得火箭成了联盟中最难以令人放心的球队。所有预测火箭有能力角逐总冠军的家伙都不会忘了加上一个前提——如果姚麦能保持健康，如果阿泰斯特不再惹是生非。当被问起球队的健康问题时，火箭主教练里克-阿德尔曼如是说：“我倒是想问你，‘明天我会拥有哪些球员(比赛和训练)？’至于球员的进出，这是一个永远没有头尾的话题。”毫无疑问，火箭的确很有竞争力，他们很长一段时间都是西南赛区的头名，在伤病满营的情况下，他们现在实际上做得还不错。因为那波22连胜，上赛季的火箭是最两人称奇的球队之一。而且，在后10场胜利中，球队中并没有姚明。除了1971-1972赛季湖人狂飙33连胜，火箭是历史上连胜场次最长的球队。但这些又代表了什么呢？	麦蒂,姚明,阿泰斯特,里克-阿德尔曼	正向	"Experts: The rocket has three major security risks. It will be a miracle that Yao Ming is no longer injured. Sina Sports News reported on December 5, Beijing time. According to the existing information, it is carefully and responsibly predicted that the Houston Rockets will end this regular season as the fifth in the West. After the Rockets' offseason harvest Ron Artest, this forecast is quite different from those inflated remarks. You know, some so-called experts think this team can make it to the finals. The current rocket seems to be plagued by a problem, that is, injury. As early as during the training camp of the Rockets, it was reported that after experiencing the first operation of his career, McGrady's knee was still very painful. McGrady has been exempt from war for this problem in the past four games. Moreover, according to the latest news, this seven-time All Star player will not appear on the court in the next three weeks. In the past three seasons, McGrady has missed 62 games in total. There is no need to hide that McGrady is the most talented basketball player of his generation. However, at the age of 29 - perhaps, you will be surprised that he is so young. After 11 NBA seasons, he has been injured. When McGrady entered the league as a high school student at the age of 18, who would have thought that he would be what he is today in 11 years. In addition to McGrady's knee injury, Yao Ming and Artest, the other two main players of the Rockets, also have their own troubles. The former is his foot and the latter is his head. The prospects of the Rockets will not be optimistic if any one of them ""attacks"". In the past three years, Yao Ming has missed 86 games due to injuries in different parts. As a 7-foot 6-inch 310 pound center, Yao Ming's body is under unimaginable pressure from ordinary people when he runs back and forth and jumps constantly. Last season, Yao Ming missed 35 games due to a navicular fracture at the time when the Rockets needed him most, and his season was lost. Not long after the operation, Yao Ming was overloaded and played on behalf of his motherland in the Beijing Olympic Games. So, if Yao Ming can be full-time this season, it will be a miracle. Let's talk about Artest. It must be admitted that Artest is not short of talent. He can play a dominant role on both sides of the attack and defense. However, in his career, he sometimes gets into trouble such as fighting, animal abuse, and asking for leave for the sake of publicizing records. The combination of these three factors, namely McGrady's knee, Yao Ming's foot and Artest's head, makes the Rockets the most worrying team in the league. All the guys who predict that the Rockets have the ability to compete for the championship will not forget to add a precondition - if Yao Miao can keep healthy, if Artest stops causing trouble. When asked about the health of the team, Rick Adelman, the head coach of the Rockets, said: ""I'd like to ask you, 'Which players will I have tomorrow (game and training)?' As for the flow of players, it is an endless topic."" There is no doubt that the Rockets are indeed very competitive. For a long time, they were the top of the Southwest Division. At present, they are actually doing well in the case of a lot of injuries. Because of that 22-game winning streak, last season's Rockets was one of the most amazing teams. Moreover, Yao Ming was not in the team in the last 10 victories. In addition to the Lakers' 33 consecutive victories in the 1971-1972 season, the Rockets are the team with the longest consecutive victories in history. But what does that mean?"
两岁娃一脚将茶几踢出缺口消费者当众怒砸“纸”家具欢欢喜喜搬进新家，却不想买回的“实木茶几”竟被2岁半的孩子一脚就踢出一个缺口来。仔细一看，才发现茶几表层薄薄的木皮下面竟全是蜂窝纸板。昨日，家住恒大名都的李先生和向先生气愤地来到万家丽路上某知名家居卖场，向商家讨个说法。消费者几锤下去砸开“纸”家具李先生和向先生同住恒大名都小区，是邻居。今年3月，他们一起在这家家居卖场的左右布艺沙发系列门店花25700元买回了两套沙发、两个茶几和两台电视柜。向先生一次性就支付了全款。“我之所以一次性付款，看中的就是‘左右’这个品牌，还有当时专柜工作人员宣称茶几和电视柜都是全实木的。”向先生表示。不过，让人意想不到的是，10月9日，李先生2岁半的孩子在家里玩耍时，不慎一脚踢到茶几上将其踢出一个口子。李先生仔细检查这个缺口，才发现木皮下面是一些硬纸片。昨日下午4时许，气愤的李先生和向先生将茶几和电视柜搬到这家家居卖场前坪，当众砸开。几锤下去再用力一拉，家具就被分成几片。里面不是木头，而是塞满了蜂窝状的硬纸板。商家蜂窝纸是新工艺，从未承诺是实木随后，记者跟随芙蓉区东屯渡工商所工作人员和向先生、李先生一起来到左右布艺沙发系列门店。店内销售人员对“口头承诺是实木家具”一说给予了否认，门店负责人也表示，他们从未向消费者承诺卖出的是实木家具，他们也并不销售实木家具。记者在现场仔细查看发现，店内确实没有实木家具的宣传，商品价目表上也没有标注其产品用的什么材质。那么，即便不是实木家具，用纸板做家具又是符合规定的吗？门店负责人随后拿出一叠证明产品合格的材料，并声称向先生和李先生购买的沙发是左右品牌，但茶几和电视柜不是左右牌的，而是他们的合作伙伴“文化龙”家具，该家具在宣传图册上明确标示是实木皮与高密度板制作而成，是两位消费者没有注意。“用蜂窝纸制作家具是业内很多家具厂商都在使用的方式，蜂窝纸节能环保，也是符合国家有关标准的。”这位负责人同时表示。工商部门要在合同上注明家具材质在仔细查看被消费者砸坏的家具，并向买卖双方了解情况后，芙蓉区东屯渡工商所所长陈钦表示，还需要进一步调查了解蜂窝纸工艺是不是符合相关国家标准和质量要求，同时要详细了解商品生产的具体流程。“目前暂不能确定左右沙发是否存在欺诈消费者的行为，工商部门将对此事展开调查。”	向先生,陈钦,李先生	负向	"A two-year-old child kicked a gap in the coffee table, and the consumer angrily smashed the ""paper"" furniture. He moved into a new house happily, but he didn't want the ""solid wood coffee table"" to be kicked into a gap by a two and a half year old child. Looking carefully, I found that there was a honeycomb cardboard under the thin wood skin of the coffee table. Yesterday, Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang, who live in Evergrande Mingdu, came angrily to a well-known home store on Wanjialilu Road to ask the merchant for an explanation. Consumers hammer and hammer to open the ""paper"" furniture. Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang live in the Evergrande Mingdu Community, and they are neighbors. In March this year, they spent 25700 yuan to buy two sets of sofas, two coffee tables and two TV cabinets in the store of Huoyou Bouyei Sofa Series in this home store. Mr. Xiang paid the full amount at one time. ""The reason why I paid in one payment is that I like the 'Left and Right' brand, and the counter staff claimed that the coffee table and TV cabinet were all solid wood."" Mr. Xiang said. However, unexpectedly, on October 9, Mr. Li's 2.5 year old child kicked a hole in the coffee table while playing at home. Mr. Li carefully examined the gap and found that there were some hard paper chips under the wooden skin. At about 4:00 pm yesterday, the angry Mr. Li and Mr. Xiang moved the coffee table and TV cabinet to the front of the home store and smashed them in public. With a few hammers and a hard pull, the furniture was divided into several pieces. It's not wood inside, but it's full of honeycomb cardboard. The merchant's honeycomb paper is a new technology, and it has never promised to be solid wood. Later, the reporter followed the staff of Dongtundu, Furong District, and Mr. Xiang and Mr. Li to the left and right cloth sofa series stores. The sales staff in the store denied that ""oral commitment is solid wood furniture"", and the store manager also said that they never promised consumers to sell solid wood furniture, and they do not sell solid wood furniture. The reporter found on the spot that there was no publicity of solid wood furniture in the store, and there was no indication of what material its products were used on the price list. Then, even if it is not solid wood furniture, is it legal to use cardboard for furniture? The store manager then took out a pile of materials to prove that the product was qualified, and claimed that the sofa purchased by Mr. Xiang and Mr. Li was the left and right brand, but the coffee table and TV cabinet were not the left and right brand, but their partner ""Culture Dragon"" furniture, which was clearly marked on the promotional brochure as being made of solid wood skin and high density board, but the two consumers did not notice. ""The use of honeycomb paper to make furniture is a way used by many furniture manufacturers in the industry. Honeycomb paper is energy saving and environment friendly, and it also meets the relevant national standards."" The responsible person also said. The industrial and commercial department shall indicate the furniture material in the contract. After carefully examining the furniture smashed by the consumer and learning about the situation from both buyers and sellers, Chen Qin, Director of Dongtundu Industrial and Commercial Office of Furong District, said that we need to further investigate whether the honeycomb paper process meets the relevant national standards and quality requirements, and at the same time, we need to learn about the specific process of commodity production in detail. ""At present, it is not yet clear whether the left and right sofas have defrauded consumers. The industrial and commercial department will investigate this matter."""

台湾偶像剧一周收视：《痞子英雄》意犹未尽新浪娱乐讯本周(6.22——6.28)《痞子英雄》播出电视版的完结篇，结局意犹未尽，收视率飙到开播以来的最高点，以4.0的平均收视击败同时段金曲奖颁奖典礼，拿下收视冠军。而周日档的《福气又安康》也以4.36的收视率冲上开播以来最高点，男女主角陈乔恩、蓝正龙、邱泽坐摩天轮庆功，寓意收视继续攀高。《痞子英雄》：意犹未尽的结局《痞子英雄》以24集结束电视版的剧情，结局当中，陈在天、小马、吴英雄三人作为正义一方勇战雇佣兵组织萨科奇首脑，周渝民等人大展拳脚功夫的武打戏成为大结局中的高潮。许多的悬念被留到电影版。由于导演的野心是不止做一部电视剧这么简单，因此观众们也只好在猜测着剧情中等待电影版问世。严格说起来，电视版只能算是故事的三分之二，人物的关系框架刚刚形成，真正的重头戏还在后头。这种电视+电影标新立异的做法尽管很有新意，但就电视版而言，却是个过分仓促的结局。何小玫的突然出现，陈在天与陈琳的感情线索，新出现幕后组织天堂的真正目的，这都是电视剧留下的大把悬念。充满悬念的结局让相当一部分观众感到意犹未尽。尽管结局看起来有点莫名其妙，这部剧仍以4.06的收视率完美收官。纵观自一开始就号称要“代表台湾目前最高制作水平”的《痞子英雄》，的确在许多方面为台湾偶像剧开拓新领域，无愧宣传时提出的口号。无论是尽量像美剧的紧凑节奏靠拢的剧情，还是以高成本制作的爆破枪战场面，都让人对台湾偶像剧产生全新认识：偶像剧除了情情爱爱，还能有如《越狱》般环环相扣的高智商剧情，让观众也能够带着悬念和猜谜的乐趣参与偶像剧。一部真正的好剧，各方面都要配合得天衣无缝，其中责任最大的当然是观众们最关注的演员，他们在镜头下用心表演，观众们能否理解剧情，多半要靠他们。这部剧集聚了台湾电视圈的大批优秀新老演员，姜是老的辣，老演员的老戏骨精神自然史毋庸置疑。青年一辈中赵又廷、陈意涵等人卖力演出，给观众们留下深刻印象，赵又廷的酷，陈意涵的可爱，在这部戏当中淋漓尽致地展现，可以预见到的是，通过这部制作优良的好剧，他们的演艺之路将更加顺畅。整部戏的灵魂人物是仔仔周渝民，他发挥出表演九年的功力，将有史以来最好的表演都奉献给痞子陈在天这个角色。就连蔡岳勋导演也高调评价说周渝民已经脱离偶像派，开始进入演员的成熟期。《福气又安康》领跑周日档偶像剧《福气又安康》日前已经播出第四集，连续四周收视夺冠，让女主角陈乔恩“收视女王”的宝座愈坐愈稳。周日档偶像剧目前是《福气》一枝独秀的局面，中视播出的韩剧《花样男子流星花园》与华视的《敲敲爱上你》在收视率上根本无法与之抗衡。偶像剧向来最喜欢以男女主角的甜蜜吻戏做卖点来吸引收视率，在第五集预告中，就出现男主角蓝正龙和陈乔恩的吻戏，相信到时会引发《福气又安康》收视率的小高潮。(小二/文)周日档偶像剧收视率排行周日21:30-24:00(2009.6.28)1福气又安康(台视)4.362花样男子流星花园(中视)2.83敲敲爱上你(华视)0.61	陈意涵,陈琳,蔡岳勋导演,陈在天,何小玫,邱泽,周渝民,蔡岳勋,仔仔,周正龙,陈乔恩,小二,姜是,赵又廷,小马,吴英雄	正向	"Taiwan idol drama weekly ratings: ""Bashful Hero"" is not yet over Sina Entertainment News This week (6.22-6.28) ""Bashful Hero"" broadcast the finale of the TV version. The ending is not yet over. The ratings soared to the highest point since its launch, defeating the Golden Melody Awards ceremony at 4.0 on average, and won the ratings championship. The Sunday drama ""Fuchie You An Kang"" also reached the highest point since its launch with a rating of 4.36. The leading actors Chen Qiaoen, Lan Zhenglong and Qiu Ze sat on the Ferris wheel to celebrate their success, meaning that the ratings continued to climb. ""Bashful Hero"": The ending of the play is not yet over. The 24 episodes of Bashful Hero ended the TV version. In the end, Chen Zaitian, Xiaoma, Wu Yuxiong and other three people fought bravely as justice against Sarkozy, the leader of the mercenary organization. The kung fu play of Zhou Yuming and other people became the climax of the ending. Many suspense was left to the film version. Since the director's ambition is not just a simple TV play, the audience have to wait for the film version to come out while guessing the plot. Strictly speaking, the TV version can only be regarded as two thirds of the story. The framework of the relationship between characters has just formed, and the real highlight is still in the future. Although this approach of TV + film is novel, it is an overly hasty ending in terms of TV version. The sudden appearance of He Xiaomei, the emotional clue between Chen Zaitian and Chen Lin, and the true purpose of the new backstage organization Paradise are all suspense left by the TV drama. The suspenseful ending made a considerable number of viewers feel that they were not yet fed up. Although the ending seems a bit inexplicable, the drama still ended perfectly with a ratings of 4.06. Looking back on the ""Bashful Hero"", which has been claiming to ""represent the highest production level in Taiwan at present"" since the beginning, it has indeed opened up new fields for Taiwanese idol dramas in many aspects, living up to the slogan proposed during the publicity. Whether it is a compact plot that tries to get close to the pace of American TV series, or the blasting gun battle scene produced at high cost, it makes people have a new understanding of Taiwanese idol dramas: idol dramas can also have intelligent plots like ""Prison Break"" that can be linked together with love and love, so that the audience can also participate in the idol drama with suspense and puzzles. A really good play requires seamless coordination in all aspects, and the biggest responsibility is of course the actors who are most concerned by the audience. They perform carefully under the camera, and the audience must rely on them to understand the plot. The play has gathered a large number of excellent new and old actors in Taiwan's television circle. Jiang is old and spicy, and the spirit of old actors' old play bones is naturally unquestioned. Zhao Youting, Chen Yihan and other people in the younger generation worked hard to give the audience a deep impression. Zhao Youting's coolness and Chen Yihan's loveliness in this play were fully demonstrated. It can be foreseen that their artistic road will be smoother through this well produced good play. The soul of the whole play is Zhou Yumin, a child. He has played for nine years and has devoted his best performance to the role of Chen Zaitian, a rogue. Even Director Cai Yuehuan highly evaluated that Zhou Yumin had脱离idol and began to enter the mature period of actors. ""Fuchie You An Kang"", a Sunday drama, has been leading the Sunday drama ""Fuchie You An Kang"" has broadcast the fourth episode, and has won the top four weeks in a row, making the leading actress Chen Qiaoen's ""Queen of Ratings"" more and more stable. At present, the Sunday drama is a lonely show of ""Fuchai"". The South Korean drama ""Meteor Garden"" broadcast by China Television and the drama ""Knocking on You"" by China Television are completely unable to compete with it in terms of ratings. Idol dramas have always liked to use the sweet kiss drama of the leading actors and actresses as a selling point to attract ratings. In the fifth episode trailer, there was a kiss drama between Lan Zhenglong and Chen Qiaoen. It is believed that it will trigger a small climax of ""Fuchie You An Kang"" ratings. ( Xiao Er/"

山东史上最牛外援有尴尬近几年混迹西亚并不得意新浪体育讯　萨马基·沃克加盟山东黄金让CBA瞩目，不过从他的简历表上，除了2005——2006赛季最后效力于步行者之外，最近几年沃克的行踪成了疑问，实际上，这几年他没有干别的，除了打IBL这样的低级别比赛，沃克一直在“混”西亚。1996——2006年间，沃克分别为小牛、马刺、湖人热队、奇才和步行者队效力，平均每场比赛贡献5.4分和4.8个篮板球。在步行者经历了一个只打了7场比赛的尴尬后，沃克到低级别的IBL联赛为一支名为森塔芭芭拉突破者队效力，之后，他开始了他的海外之旅，先是加盟了叙利亚第二大城市阿勒颇的扎拉俱乐部，然后转会到了约旦的约旦泽恩俱乐部，并在那里为球队赢得了迪拜国际公开赛的亚军，那场比赛他们输给了黎巴嫩的里雅迪俱乐部。2008——2009赛季，他加盟了黎巴嫩的萨格西俱乐部，在那里，他为这支球队效力了一个月。不过在那里的一段时间沃克过得并不愉快，他表示，“自己的俱乐部队友水平太低，我把球传给他们，他们几乎不知道怎么打”，同时，因金融危机，该家也不能兑现沃克的合同待遇，这让曾经在科比和奥尼尔身边助阵并获得一枚总冠军戒指的他不得不离开黎巴嫩，并在中国的CBA找到了新工作。(康王河)	萨马基·沃克,科比,沃克,康王河,奥尼尔	负向	"The most powerful foreign aid in the history of Shandong has been embarrassing in recent years, and has been混ing in Western Asia without success. Sina Sports News Samaki Walker joined Shandong Gold, which made CBA the center of attention. However, in recent years, Walker's whereabouts has been a question except that he played for the Pacers in the last season of 2005-2006. In fact, in recent years, he has been ""mixing"" in Western Asia except playing in low-level competitions such as IBL. From 1996 to 2006, Walker played for the Mavericks, Spurs, Lakers, Heat, Wizards and Pacers respectively, averaging 5.4 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. After an embarrassing experience in the Pacers that only played 7 games, Walker played for a team called Senta Barbara Breakers in the lower level IBL League. After that, he started his overseas journey. First, he joined the Zarla Club in Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria, and then transferred to the Jordan Zhen Club in Jordan, where he won the runner-up of the Dubai International Open for the team. They lost to Riadi Club of Lebanon in that game. In the 2008-2009 season, he joined the Saugxi Club of Lebanon, where he played for a month. However, Walker didn't have a good time there, he said, ""my club teammates are too low. I pass the ball to them, and they almost don't know how to play"". At the same time, due to the financial crisis, the family could not honor Walker's contract, which forced him to leave Lebanon and find a new job in the CBA of China. (Kang Wang River)"

黄金周建材促销热市场冷低迷行情难突破“金九”已踏空，“银十”或可期。“十一黄金周”是各大建材商家不愿错失的销售良机，也被不少消费者认为是一年内市场价格最低的时段。全国各地卖场纷纷推出各种促销活动：优惠折扣、现金抽奖、样品特价、赠品礼包、限量抢购、千元竞拍、总裁签售……活动一波接一波，规模和力度堪称一年之最。本报驻全国各地20多个记者采访后得知，总体来看，“十一”期间的促销情况没有商家预计那么好，市场情势不容乐观，卖场促销凉意袭人；不过也有局部地区、个别卖场表现不错。市场观望气氛浓厚北京，天气微凉，但是各大卖场以及商家假日促销的热情不减，铆足了劲，期望能在国庆长假期间有所斩获。“十一”促销期间，记者来到北四环居然之家，见到很多店面都门庭冷落，包括美标这样的国际品牌，店内产品也无人问津，箭牌卫浴展厅入口处的人员相对较多，因店内打5、6折，吸引了不少顾客。据罗马卫浴的导购员介绍，今年他们店面销售额与往年相比下降了一半，整个卖场的销售也不如以前，比较冷清。在“十一”期间，居然之家瓷砖区更显冷清，每家店内都没有什么顾客。据业内经销商介绍，今年很多品牌销售额都处于下滑阶段，能保持与往年持平就算是表现不错。华耐工作人员顾程在面对北京销售困境时比较乐观。据他介绍，今年瓷砖的销售额还处于上升，只是增加幅度与往年相比要小一些。“金九银十”虽然说是销售旺季，但北京受到限房政策的影响，让很多潜在的消费群体都处于观望的状态，目前还很难打开这个局面。记者从北京海淀区建材城、万家灯火装饰城、“好家居”建材装饰市场等大型卖场了解到，民众的真实购买需求被抑制，市场观望气氛浓厚，预计“银十”销售量也很难取得突破性进展。市场遇冷行情低迷上海市宜山路建材市场地处热闹的徐家汇商圈，是当地最大的建材家装市场之一。在科拉胜、兴力达、喜盈门、佳饰家等卖场，大小促销活动不断。据记者观察，“十一”黄金周前三天个别品牌企业人气较旺，如TOTO卫浴，但总体上行情低迷。据了解，上半年科拉胜建材市场的收入比3年前缩水了六七成。记者在走访过程中了解到，一些商家在苦苦坚守之后，已经考虑转行了。9月底以来，受台风“纳沙”影响，广西东南地区持续降雨，整个国庆黄金周的商家促销活动几乎全部“泡汤”。国庆之前，不少经销商都指望“这个黄金周冲销量”，按往年行情来看，国庆节作为产品促销的最重要节点之一，可占到全年销售额的15%-17%。然而国庆以来持续强降雨天气，给消费者外出购物造成极大不便。南宁富安居(琅东)建材广场的客流量比平时多了一些，但是与卖场的喜庆气氛相比，还是显得冷清。部分商家表示，“金九银十”变“冷九寒十”，全年惨淡几成定局。在“十一”黄金周期间，成都陶瓷市场几家欢喜几家愁。富森·美家居和红星美凯龙在国庆长假的头两天人气不减，而博美装饰城(西门)和新世纪装饰城却显得多少有些冷清，人流量明显不及前两个市场。富森华润建材、安华卫浴、金意陶等行业知名品牌的店面销售人员忙得不亦乐乎，俨然成为国庆促销大戏的主角；而大多数二三线品牌的销售情况比平常好不了多少。昆明各大建材市场上，记者看到在促销的带动下，各建材市场的人流量比平时有了显著提升。在走访中，部分商家对“十一”期间的销售量表示满意，基本上达到预期。但整个市场的销售情况仍然没有预期的理想。消费潜力有待释放在以往“金九银十”期间，建材行业的销售状况与商家的让利促销活动有很大关系，商家只要在节假日发起促销活动，销售情况都会不错。今年的建材行业受楼市调控政策以及轮番加息银根紧缩的影响，与楼市现状一样一直处于低迷的状态。据不完全统计，9月全国楼市销量再度出现显著下滑。全国主要城市9月以来新房周均销售量环比下降25%，其中，一线城市下降31%，二线城市下降22%，三线城市下降23%。		负向	"The Golden Week building materials promotion market is cold and depressed, and it is hard to break through the ""Golden September"" has been missed, and ""Silver October"" may be expected. The ""National Day Golden Week"" is a good opportunity for major building materials merchants to miss, and it is also considered by many consumers to be the lowest market price in a year. Shopping malls across the country have launched various promotional activities: discount discounts, cash lottery, sample special prices, gift packages, limited purchase, thousand yuan bidding, president's signature sale... Activities are wave after wave, and the scale and strength are the most in a year. After more than 20 reporters stationed in various parts of the country interviewed, it is learned that in general, the promotion situation during the ""11th"" period is not as good as the businessmen expected, the market situation is not optimistic, and the promotion of the store is cold; However, there are also local areas and individual stores that perform well. The market is waiting for the weather in Beijing, which is slightly cool, but the enthusiasm of major stores and merchants for holiday promotion is unabated. They are very motivated and hope to make some achievements during the National Day holiday. During the ""National Day"" promotion, the reporter came to Jinzhijia, North Fourth Ring Road, and saw that many stores were deserted, including international brands such as American Standards. There was no one in the store who asked about the products. The personnel at the entrance of Arrow Sanitary Ware Exhibition Hall were relatively较多. Because the store was giving 50% and 60% off, it attracted many customers. According to the sales guide of Rome Bathroom, this year's store sales decreased by half compared with the past, and the sales of the whole store were not as good as before, which was relatively quiet. During the ""11th"" period, the tile area of Jinzhijia was even colder, and there were no customers in each store. According to the industry dealer, this year's sales of many brands are in a declining stage, and it is considered a good performance to maintain the same level as in the past. Gu Cheng, a staff member of Huanae, was more optimistic in the face of Beijing's sales dilemma. According to him, the sales of tiles this year is still increasing, but the increase is smaller than that in previous years. ""Golden September and Silver October"" is said to be the peak sales season, but the restriction of housing policy in Beijing has made many potential consumer groups wait and see. At present, it is still difficult to open up this situation. The reporter learned from large shopping malls such as Beijing Haidian Building Materials City, Wan Jiajia Lighting Decoration City, and ""Good Home"" Building Materials Decoration Market that the real purchase needs of the people have been restrained, the market is waiting, and it is expected that the ""Silver October"" sales will be hard to make a breakthrough. The market is cold and depressed. Shanghai Yishan Road Building Materials Market, located in the busy Xujiahui business circle, is one of the largest local building materials home decoration markets. There are many promotional activities in the stores such as Kolasun, Xinglida, Xiyingmen and Jia Shijia. According to the reporter's observation, the popularity of individual brand enterprises was very strong in the first three days of the ""Eleven"" Golden Week, such as TOTO Bathroom, but the overall market was depressed. It is understood that the income of Kolasun Building Materials Market in the first half of this year has shrunk by 60% and 70% in three years. The reporter learned through his visit that some businessmen have considered changing their jobs after hard efforts. Since late September, due to the impact of Typhoon ""Nasha"", southeast Guangxi has had continuous rainfall, and the promotion activities of National Day Golden Week have almost all ""spoiled"". Before National Day, many dealers were counting on ""this golden week to boost sales"". According to the market trend in previous years, National Day, as one of the most important nodes of product promotion, can account for 15% - 17% of the annual sales. However, the continuous heavy rainfall since National Day has caused great inconvenience to consumers' shopping outside. The passenger flow of Fuanju (Langdong) Building Materials Square in Nanning is somewhat more than usual, but it is still quiet compared with the festive atmosphere of the store. Some businessmen said that ""Golden September and Cold October"" changed to ""Cold September and Cold October"", and the whole year was almost doomed to be bleak. During the ""National Day Golden Week"", several ceramic markets in Chengdu were happy and several were worried. Fushun · Meijiaju and Hongxing Meikailong were still popular on the first two days of the National Day holiday, while Bomei Decoration City (West Gate) and Xinjishiji Decoration City were somewhat deserted, and the traffic was significantly less than the other two markets. The sales staff of the stores of Fushun Huazhong Building Materials, Anhua Sanitary Ware, King Yitao and other industry famous brands were very busy, and they became the main actors of the National Day promotion; However, the sales situation of most second and third tier brands is not much better than usual. In the major building materials markets of Kunming, the reporter saw that under the promotion, the traffic of the building materials markets had significantly increased compared with the normal level. During the visit, some businessmen expressed satisfaction with the sales volume during the ""Eleven"" period, basically reaching the expected level. However, the sales situation of the whole market is still not as good as expected. Consumption potential needs to be released During the previous ""Golden September and Silver October"", the sales situation of the building materials industry had a lot to do with the concession and promotion activities of the businessmen. The businessmen would do well as long as they launched promotion activities on holidays. This year's building materials industry is affected by the real estate market regulation policy and the tight monetary policy of interest rate hikes, and is in a depressed state like the real estate market. According to incomplete statistics, the national real estate sales volume declined significantly again in September. Since September, the average weekly sales volume of new houses in major cities across the country has decreased by 25% compared with the previous month, including a decrease of 31% in first tier cities, 22% in second tier cities, and 23% in third tier cities."

On the 13th local time, a South Korean fishing boat mistakenly entered Japan's exclusive economic zone, and the captain was detained by the Japanese side for ignoring the warning. The ships of the Japan Coast Guard and the South Korea Marine Police Department briefly confronted each other, but then carried out a joint investigation. The fishing boat ignored the warning and escaped. The Japanese media reported that at around 10:30 on the 13th, the patrol ship of the Japanese Fisheries Department found a suspicious ship in the Japanese exclusive economic zone near Hyogo County, so it tracked the ship's movements and finally found that the ship was a South Korean fishing boat engaged in crab fishing in the Japanese exclusive economic zone. The patrol ship of the Fisheries Department immediately asked the ship to stop and stop working for inspection, while the South Korean fishing boat found that its whereabouts were exposed, so it ignored the warning and escaped from the scene. The Japanese patrol boat immediately notified the maritime security hall ship cruising in the nearby sea area to assist in capturing the South Korean fishing boat. At about 11:30, the Japanese side intercepted the South Korean fishing boat and arrested the captain on the grounds of violating the relevant fisheries laws of its own country. But this news has not been confirmed by the South Korean side. It is reported that the fishing boat called the police during the escape process. After receiving the news, the frigate No. 5001 belonging to the South Korean sea police rushed to the scene. After communication between the two sides, the Japanese side expressed its willingness to jointly investigate this matter with the South Korean side. After investigation and verification by both parties, ""South Korean fishing boats really infringe on Japan's exclusive economic zone. The South Korean media later confirmed that the fishing boat that entered the Japanese exclusive economic zone was the ""33 Shuanglong"". But both sides have different views on the fishing boat's intrusion into Japan's exclusive economic zone. The South Korean media did not agree with the South Korean fishing boat's operation in Japan's exclusive economic zone. The media quoted a South Korean government official as saying that the fishing boat only accidentally entered Japan's exclusive economic zone and did not operate because the engine broke down and drifted to Japan's waters with the waves. The Japan Coast Guard did not use ""confrontation"" to describe the meeting of the two countries' maritime security forces. The South Korean government expressed the hope that this incident would not affect the cooperation atmosphere between the two countries.

陈水扁机要费案今日再审要求吴淑珍须出庭应讯中新网9月19日电据台湾《联合报》报道，台北地方法院今天开庭审理“国务机要费”案，陈水扁妻子吴淑珍日前递送陈明状，表示因身体不佳无法到庭，但遭合议庭驳回；合议庭并指示台大医院搬运病床、急救设施及药品到第八法庭，医师及护士今天到庭待命，显现今天非要吴淑珍到庭不可的决心。吴淑珍十六日委任律师向法院递状，表示她“几近每天昏厥一至二次”，无法出庭；但合议庭以她未附诊断证明，且台大医院已配合法院做好医疗准备，吴淑珍出庭不致有立即的生命危险，驳回她的声请。陈水扁办公室昨天发布新闻稿，否认吴淑珍曾提出请假要求，表示是向法院提出刑事“陈明状”，恳请法院偕同台大专业医疗人员了解吴淑珍是否适合出庭。至于外传陈水扁可能以“辅佐人”身分陪同吴淑珍出庭；亲扁人士透露，扁、珍的身分同属被告，陈水扁“不适宜、也没必要”担任吴淑珍的辅佐人。扁办虽否认吴淑珍向法院“请假”，但台北地院行政庭长黄俊明说，被告递状是否属于请假，要看内容而定；吴淑珍陈明状有请假的意思。法界人士认为，扁办否认吴淑珍请假，辩称只是递“刑事陈明状”，但明眼人一看内容，就是在请假，扁办何必玩文字游戏。吴淑珍委任律师李胜雄、廖学兴十六日下午向法院递交陈明状指出，吴淑珍六月底骨折，必须支撑抬高；上个月又感冒，迄今未愈，最近一周几乎每天昏厥一至二次。台北地院指出，合议庭决定每开庭半小时就休息十分钟，若有必要，吴淑珍可以躺在法庭准备的病床上应讯，而且有台大医院医疗设备及专业医护人员在法庭内待命，吴淑珍必须到庭应讯。另据报道，为顺利传讯吴淑珍，台大医院应法院要求，指派医护人员及急救相关设备进驻。不过，遭指派到庭待命的医护都避之唯恐不及。据了解，台大急诊部最后只能经由协调，由一名医师和一名护理人员今天到台北地院待命，对吴淑珍可能的状况，急诊部已沙盘推演。陈水扁办公室称吴淑珍并未提出请假要求机要费案将再开庭陈水扁称吴淑珍近日昏倒两次	陈水扁,吴淑珍,李胜雄,廖学兴,黄俊明	负向	"Chen Shui-bian's special case was reviewed again today, and Wu Shuzhen was required to appear in court. China News Network, September 19- The Taipei District Court opened a hearing today on the ""State Council's Special Fee"" case. Chen Shui-bian's wife, Wu Shuzhen, recently submitted a statement, saying that she was unable to appear in court due to poor health, but it was rejected by the court; The court also instructed the University of Taiwan Hospital to move beds, emergency facilities and medicines to the eighth court. Doctors and nurses were on standby in court today, showing the determination that Wu Shuzhen must appear in court today. Wu Shuzhen entrusted a lawyer to submit a statement to the court on the 16th, saying that she ""almost faints once or twice a day"" and cannot attend the court; However, the court rejected her application because she did not attach a diagnosis certificate, and the University of Taiwan Hospital has made medical preparations in accordance with the court. Wu Shuzhen's appearance in court will not cause immediate danger to her life. Chen Shui-bian's office issued a press release yesterday, denying that Wu Shuzhen had made a leave application, and said that it was a criminal ""statement"" to the court, asking the court to accompany the medical staff of Taiwan University to find out whether Wu Shuzhen was suitable to appear in court. As for the rumor that Chen Shui-bian may accompany Wu Shuzhen to court as an ""auxiliary person""; People close to Bian revealed that Bian and Zhen were co defendants, and Chen Shui-bian was ""not suitable or necessary"" to serve as Wu Shuzhen's assistant. Although Banto's office denied that Wu Shuzhen had ""leave"" from the court, Huang Junming, the administrative court director of the Taipei District Court, said that it depends on the content of the defendant's status whether it belongs to leave; Wu Shuzhen's statement was to take leave. Legal circles believe that Banto's office denied that Wu Shuzhen had leave, arguing that it was just a ""criminal statement"", but anyone with discerning eyes can see that it is taking leave. There is no need for Banto's office to play word games. Li Shengxiong, a lawyer entrusted by Wu Shuzhen, and Liu Xuexing pointed out in the statement submitted to the court on the afternoon of the 16th that Wu Shuzhen broke her bones at the end of June and had to be lifted up to support her; Last month, I had a cold and I haven't recovered until now. I almost faint once or twice a day in the past week. The Taipei District Court pointed out that the court decided to have a rest for ten minutes every half an hour. If necessary, Wu Shuzhen can lie on the sickbed prepared by the court to respond to the court. There are medical equipment and professional medical staff of the University of Taiwan Hospital on standby in the court. Wu Shuzhen must appear in court. According to another report, in order to successfully pass the news to Wu Shuzhen, the court asked the University of Taiwan Hospital to dispatch medical staff and emergency related equipment. However, the medical staff assigned to wait in court are afraid to avoid it. It is understood that the Department of Emergency Medicine of Taiwan University can only coordinate with a doctor and a nurse to wait in the Taipei District Court today. The Department of Emergency Medicine has made a sand table exercise on the possible condition of Wu Shuzhen. Chen Shui-bian's office said that Wu Shuzhen did not apply for leave. The case of Chen Shui-bian's resignation will be reopened. Chen Shui-bian said that Wu Shuzhen had fainted twice recently"

张瑞希《妻子的诱惑》再演复仇女观众：很可怕本报讯(记者张晓禾)近来，韩国SBS每日剧《妻子的诱惑》显示出了惊人的潜力，不仅在韩国收视率一路攀升，在中国，也有众多网友每天守在网上看最快的更新。《妻子的诱惑》到底是用何种法宝将观众“诱惑”住的呢？温顺妻也有愤怒的一天这是关于一个传统的韩国女人被丈夫和好友背叛、几乎被害死，后来以另一个身份复仇的故事。女主角恩才(张瑞希饰)是一个温顺、善良的妻子，而她的丈夫早在他们结婚前就和她的好姐妹有染，婚后也一直在猎艳。恩才的好姐妹一直很妒忌恩才嫁到富有的家庭，在恩才结婚前就勾引了她的未婚夫，出国几年读书回国后，继续勾引她的丈夫，并在恩才怀孕后，还从国外接来一个小男孩说是和恩才的丈夫生的孩子，后来为了顺利和恩才丈夫结婚，逼着恩才离婚，还与恩才丈夫合谋把恩才害得掉下海，在以为恩才死了后，他们就快乐地结婚去了。恩才被救后孩子没了，也没有联系自己的亲人，在暗中看到她死后夫家婆婆、前夫和那个好友还是不断陷害、伤害她的家人，十分气愤，就决定以另一个身份出现，勾引自己的前夫，等前夫和那个女人分手后，再把他狠狠抛弃……人物性格极端是看点除剧情引人入胜外，极具极端性的人物角色也起到了调味料的作用。使尽浑身解数欺辱儿媳的婆婆(金宝拉饰)以及与婆婆一同干尽坏事的恩才的好姐妹申爱丽激起了观众的愤怒。当剧情发展到恩才落水后被健宇救起之时，观众一面暗骂恶夫郑焦彬与无恶不作的申爱丽，一面从善良的智障姑姑(吴英实饰)那儿寻找着安慰。“人鱼小姐”张瑞希的卖力表演同样是该剧的一大法宝。正是有了她的卖力演出，《妻子的诱惑》才得以成功地引起了观众的共鸣。3招让女人更受欢迎会打扮恩才化名闵素姬“重生”后上的第一节课便是着装打扮，在不断的模仿和学习中，她从一个略为土气的大脸姑娘变成人见人爱的惊艳女郎，容颜虽相似，气质却不同，所有人都识不破她的真正身份。该剧在韩国时装界引发“张瑞希效应”，她在剧中穿过的服饰被不少服装公司疯狂效仿。有内涵对“秀外慧中”一词，恩才理解最深。为了演好留学归来的闵素姬这一角色，恩才废寝忘食学习外语、游泳、高尔夫、跳舞、绘画、理财，焦彬自己都称：“以前女人接近我，我觉得都是为了钱，但是闵小姐你这么有钱，这么有才华，能看得上我，我真是三生有幸……”会撒娇恩才是个“不会撒娇”的女人，即便面对婆婆的百般刁难和丈夫的背叛，她也一声不吭。但化身闵素姬后，她在前夫面前，细语柔情地说话；跟情敌发生冲突时，只要焦彬一出现，她立刻装出受害者的可怜模样，激起焦彬的保护欲。网友不赞同恩才的复仇方式恩才在剧中由单纯善良的贤妻变成充满仇恨的复仇女子，180度的大转身让观众看得过瘾的同时，也为她感到心疼。观众李小姐就说：“虽然恩才之后变得更漂亮、更有内涵了，但却很可怕，我们再也看不到她以前的清纯可人了，她无时无刻都在盘算如何复仇，这样的人物在影视剧中出现可以，在现实生活中我们都不想看到。”观众张女士也表示：“我只爱恩才后来的外形和内涵，并不赞同她极端的复仇方式，她在复仇的同时其实也在伤害自己。”	吴英实,金宝拉,张晓禾,张瑞希,郑焦彬,健宇,恩才,闵素姬,申爱丽,张女士	正向	"The recent Korean SBS daily drama ""Wife's Temptation"" has shown amazing potential, not only the ratings in South Korea have been rising all the way, but also many netizens in China keep watching the fastest updates online every day.

内置显卡六款支持3D加速安卓手机推荐科技发达的今天，3D早已深入我们的生活。游戏玩家都喜欢自己电脑的3D功能强大，可以玩大型3D游戏。随着手机与平板电脑的硬件不断升级，掌上终端设备的性能越来越强大，部分手机处理3D任务早就不在话下，例如NvidiaTegra2这款CPU，内置了GeForceGPU，3D性能堪比老款PC。漫漫旅途，拿着手机坐在车里，玩一把效果绚丽的3D游戏。不仅对自己来说是一种享受，同时也能获得周围人羡慕的目光。到底哪些手机的处理器是支持3D加速功能的呢？下面就让我们来看看吧。推荐机型：LGOptimus2X(参数报价图片论坛软件)(P993)参考价格：2680元手机特色：外观帅气硬朗，性能霸气强悍简约时尚、帅气硬朗的LGP993，搭载了全球首款移动终端双核处理器NvidiaTegra2，性能是现有智能手机的10倍，作为全球第一款双核手机，引导手机进入双核时代。它的性能相当强大，集成NVIDIAGeForceGPU，可带来出色的移动3D游戏体验和快速响应的3D界面。LGP993采用直板造型，外形简洁时尚，拿在手里稍微有些大，很有分量感。虽然接口位置突兀，但整体感觉不错，机身顶部防尘盖上大大的HDMI字样，很是吸引人。同时，银色装饰条设计为机身背部增添了一番清新的感觉，不过银色装饰条不耐磨，容易留下划痕。一颗800万像素摄像头与LED闪光灯一齐位于机身上部。LGP993正面配有一块4.0英寸的电容触摸屏幕，400x800像素的分辨率，1600万色的色彩数趋于主流。显示非常出色，LGP993搭载了Android2.2的智能操作系统，配合LG的二次开发界面，具有滑动解锁功能、最多七分屏等实用功能，而且3D效果也非常明显，支持GSM/WCDMA的网络制式。LGP993使用了NvidiaTegra2双核处理器，主频高达1GHz，支持3D加速，运行大型3D游戏的时候，这款CPU的强劲得以完全体现。内存组合为8GBROM+512MBRAM，可以轻松的应对各种储存和程序安装，完全不必担心ROM不够使用。不过仅有1500mAh的电池应对双核CPU和4.0寸超大屏幕显得有些力不从心。编辑点评：这款手机帅气硬朗，屏幕分辨率也很高，显示效果亮丽，拍照效果出众，加上支持3D加速的双核芯片，支持1080P视频录制，无一不让它成为人们心目中的性感机神。但是RAM相对而言不是很大，日后升级的是很可能会受到些许影响，续航时间也让人头疼。		正向	Built-in graphics card recommends six 3D acceleration Android mobile phones. Today, with the development of science and technology, 3D has long been deeply integrated into our lives. Gamers all like their computers' 3D function is very powerful, which can play large 3D games. With the continuous upgrading of mobile phone and tablet computer hardware, the performance of handheld terminal devices is becoming more and more powerful, and some mobile phones have long been able to handle 3D tasks, such as NvidiaTegra2 CPU, which has a GeForceGPU built in, and its 3D performance is comparable to that of the old PC. On a long journey, holding a mobile phone in a car and playing a beautiful 3D game is not only a kind of enjoyment for yourself, but also a way to get envious looks from people around you. Which mobile phone processors support 3D acceleration? Let's have a look. Recommended model: LGOptimus2X (parameter quotation picture forum software) (P993) Reference price: 2680 yuan Mobile phone characteristics: Handsome and tough appearance, simple and fashionable style, LGP993, with the world's first dual-core processor NvidiaTegra2 for mobile terminals, has a performance ten times that of the existing smart phones. As the world's first dual-core mobile phone, it leads the mobile phone into the dual-core era. Its performance is quite powerful, integrated with NVIDIAGeForceGPU, it can bring excellent mobile 3D game experience and quick response 3D interface. LGP993 adopts a straight plate shape, with a simple and fashionable shape. It is slightly large in your hand and has a lot of weight. Although the interface position is abrupt, the overall feeling is good. The large HDMI on the dust cover at the top of the fuselage is very attractive. At the same time, the silver trim strip is designed to add a fresh feeling to the back of the fuselage, but the silver trim strip is not wear-resistant and easy to leave scratches. An 8 million pixel camera and an LED flash are located at the top of the fuselage. LGP993 is equipped with a 4.0 inch capacitive touch screen on the front, with a resolution of 400x800 pixels and 16 million colors, which is trending to the mainstream. The display is very good. LGP993 is equipped with the Android2.2 intelligent operating system. Together with LG's secondary development interface, it has the functions of slide unlocking, up to seven screen division and other practical functions. Moreover, the 3D effect is very obvious and supports the network system of GSM/WCDMA. LGP993 uses NvidiaTegra2 dual-core processor, with the main frequency as high as 1GHz, which supports 3D acceleration. When running large 3D games, the power of this CPU is fully reflected. The memory combination is 8GBROM+512MBRAM, which can easily handle various storage and program installation. There is no need to worry about the lack of ROM. However, the 1500mAh battery is not enough to deal with the dual-core CPU and the 4.0 inch super large screen. Editor's comment: This mobile phone is handsome and tough, the screen resolution is very high, the display effect is bright, and the photo effect is excellent. Together with the dual-core chip that supports 3D acceleration and supports 1080P video recording, it is sexy and sexy in people's hearts. However, the RAM is not very large, and it is likely to be affected in the future, and the battery life is also a headache.

巴基斯坦军方称冲突地区恢复平静需一年新华网巴基斯坦拉瓦尔品第6月6日电（记者李敬臣饶博）巴基斯坦军方发言人阿巴斯少将6日说，预计全部清除西北部冲突地区的武装分子，并使当地恢复平静还需要一年左右的时间。阿巴斯是当天在巴三军公关部总部举行的新闻发布会上回答提问时作上述表示的。他说，巴安全部队从4月底在西北部地区开始军事行动以来已经累计打死1305名武装分子，安全部队方面也有105人死亡。过去24小时里，安全部队继续在西北边境省多个地区展开行动，在斯瓦特河谷地区打死17名武装分子，安全部队方面有1人身亡。阿巴斯说，安全部队将继续在冲突地区驻扎。他说，目前安全部队还没有决定是否要前往南瓦济里斯坦部落地区打击武装分子，这将取决于政府的决定。阿巴斯还说，被取缔的宗教组织“执行先知穆罕默德法典运动”头目苏菲·穆罕默德并没有被捕。该组织4日曾向媒体宣称苏菲·穆罕默德被捕。巴基斯坦西北边境省政府今年2月与“执行先知穆罕默德法典运动”达成协议，同意一旦塔利班武装盘踞的斯瓦特河谷地区恢复和平，将在包括斯瓦特河谷地区在内的马拉根德区实行伊斯兰教法。该协议4月13日得到国民议会（下院）一致通过。但这一地区的塔利班武装拒绝放下武器并占领一些政府机构，袭击安全部队检查站。巴安全部队随后分别对迪尔、布内尔和斯瓦特地区发起军事行动，全面打击塔利班武装。	阿巴斯,饶博,李敬臣,穆罕默德,苏菲·穆罕默德	正向	"The Pakistani military said that it would take about a year to restore peace in the conflict area. Xinhua News Agency, Rawal Pindi, Pakistan, June 6 (Reporter Li Jingchen Rao Bo) The Pakistani military spokesman, General Abbas, said on the 6th that it was expected that it would take about a year to eliminate the armed elements in the northwest conflict area and restore local peace. Abbas made the above statement when he answered questions at a press conference held by the Pakistani Army Public Relations Department on the same day. He said that the Pakistani security forces had cumulatively killed 1305 militants since the military operation in the northwest region at the end of April, and 105 people died on the side of the security forces. In the past 24 hours, the security forces continued to operate in many areas of the North West Frontier Province, killing 17 militants in the Swat Valley area and one person on the side of the security forces. Abbas said that the security forces will continue to station in the conflict area. He said that the security forces had not yet decided whether to go to the South Waziristan tribal area to fight the militants, which will depend on the decision of the government. Abbas also said that the leader of the banned religious organization ""Execute Prophet Mohammed's Canon Movement"", Sufi Mohammed, was not arrested. The organization once claimed to the media on the 4th that Sufi Mohammed had been arrested. The provincial government of Pakistan's northwest border area reached an agreement with the ""Execute Prophet Mohammed's Canon Movement"" in February this year, agreeing that once the Swat Valley area where the Taliban are stationed is restored peace, the Islamic law will be implemented in the Malagand District, including the Swat Valley area. The agreement was unanimously approved by the National Assembly (Lower House) on April 13. However, the Taliban in this area refused to lay down their arms and occupy some government institutions, and attacked the security forces checkpoints. The Pakistani security forces then launched military operations in Dir, Buner and Swat areas respectively to fully combat the Taliban."
暴风影音“损失”千万清除低俗广告互联网企业甘愿自断广告财路？暴风影音CEO冯鑫近日表示，暴风影音将于今年元月开始进行广告物料净化检查，继续“去广告”行动，这项措施将导致暴风影音损失近千万元年收入。据悉，此次事件源起有网友借用暴风影音2011新年版左下角边框悬浮广告语——“15岁少女凹凸有致”，在微博留言给冯鑫，表示对暴风影音上的低俗广告的不满。网友留言两日后，冯鑫在微博上回应：“为彻底摆脱‘15岁少女凹凸有致’的讽刺以及给大家观赏不快感，我们终于决心在承受收入损失的前提下，做广告物料净化检查。这是暴风继去除播放窗体上按钮广告后，可能损失年收入千万级以上的第二次‘去广告’行动，2011年元月执行！”而冯鑫本人也在之后的采访中证实了微博中的内容。目前，国内视频网站在带宽、服务器上的烧钱速度过快，成本投入过高，导致即便是收入达到了亿元级别的一线视频网站也难以盈利，而广告收入则是视频网站实现盈亏平衡的重要渠道。这意味着，连续两次清除年利润千万级别的广告，对于暴风影音来说无异于是一种“自杀行为”。对此，业内人士表示，将冯鑫两次砍掉广告的举措与暴风影音力推高清视频放在一起来分析，这说明视频行业的竞争焦点已转移到了用户体验上。站在3亿左右视频网民的角度，视频行业会越来越注重体验的竞争。冯鑫下决心清除低俗广告，是其看重用户体验，拓展视频市场份额的长远投资。冯鑫曾经宣布暴风影音大约在2012年启动纳斯达克上市之旅，此番一系列连续塑造口碑的举措可以看成是暴风影音做好“长跑”的准备，也可以看成是在调整自身业务，运作更加健康的思路。冯鑫宣布清除低俗广告后，很多微博网友留言表示支持。而这种行为被肯定的背后更重要的因素是用户的感受被企业所尊重。商报记者张绪旺	张绪旺,冯鑫	正向	"The Storm Video ""lost"" tens of millions to clean up vulgar advertisements. Internet enterprises are willing to cut off their advertising money? Feng Xin, CEO of Storm Video, recently said that Storm Video will start to purify advertising materials in January this year, and continue the ""de advertising"" action, which will lead to a loss of nearly ten million yuan of annual income for Storm Video. It is reported that this incident originated from a netizen who borrowed the floating advertisement in the lower left corner of the 2011 New Year's Edition of Storm Video - ""15 year old girls are concave and convex"". They left a message in microblog to Feng Xin to express their dissatisfaction with the vulgar advertisement on Storm Video. Two days after the netizens left a message, Feng Xin responded on microblog: ""In order to get rid of the irony of '15 year old girls are concave and convex' and give everyone an unpleasant feeling, we have finally decided to do advertising material purification under the premise of bearing income loss. This is the second ""de advertising"" action of Fengbao after removing the button advertisement on the playback window, which may lose more than ten million yuan of annual income, and will be implemented in January 2011!"" Feng Xin himself also confirmed the content in the microblog in the subsequent interview. At present, domestic video websites are burning money too fast on bandwidth and servers, and the cost investment is too high, which leads that even the first-line video websites with income reaching the billion yuan level are difficult to make profits, and advertising income is an important channel for video websites to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. This means that the continuous removal of advertisements with an annual profit of tens of millions of yuan is a kind of ""suicidal behavior"" for Storm Video. In this regard, industry insiders said that Feng Xin's two advertising cuts and Storm's promotion of HD video should be analyzed together, which shows that the focus of competition in the video industry has shifted to user experience. From the perspective of about 300 million video Internet users, the video industry will pay more and more attention to the competition of experience. Feng Xin's determination to eliminate vulgar advertisements is a long-term investment in expanding the video market share in view of the user experience. Feng Xin once announced that Fengbao would start its journey to list on NASDAQ in 2012. This series of continuous reputation building measures can be seen as a preparation for Fengbao to do a good job in ""long distance running"", or as an adjustment of its own business and a more healthy way of thinking. After Feng Xin announced the elimination of vulgar advertisements, many microblog users left messages to show their support. The more important factor behind this behavior being affirmed is that the feelings of users are respected by enterprises. Zhang Xuwang, a business reporter"
爵士vs湖人前瞻：科比重任在肩紫金军送人9连败新浪体育讯　北京时间4月5日消息，保罗-加索尔本赛季还没有休战过，如果他能够继续出战，那么洛杉矶湖人队(55胜21负)对犹他爵士队(36胜41负)的主场连胜应该可以延续。九连胜刚刚被终结的湖人队急需反弹，科比-布莱恩特和队友们不会放过主场赢球的任何机会。在输给掘金队后，湖人队结束九连胜，他们与西部领头羊马刺队的差距被拉开到两场半。不过与冲击西部头号种子相比，湖人队更看重的是球员健康，可坏事往往是一起上门。加索尔在第三节扣篮时被内内犯规，他的右膝被对手撞到，经过检查西班牙人右膝骨头挫伤，他能否出场要等到赛前确定。“实际上我的感觉要比昨天好了许多，这是一个不错的信号，我感觉不错。”加索尔对记者表示。加索尔自我感觉不错，但菲尔-杰克逊愿意冒险吗？毕竟湖人队是要争取总冠军的球队，一场常规赛的胜负并没有那么重要，因此“禅师”很可能会安排加索尔休息。安德鲁-拜纳姆在与掘金队交锋时也膝盖受伤，他的情况要好许多，明天应该可以出战。有了拜纳姆和拉玛尔-奥多姆的存在，湖人队内线就可以确保一定的竞争力，这也可能促使加索尔被安排休息。加索尔在内线的重要性不言而喻，如果他无法出场，其他内线必须要给予球队更多的帮助，而作为球队领袖的科比当仁不让要承担更多责任。湖人队还需要五场胜利达到60胜，此前杰克逊带领球队拿到60胜后都成功夺冠。“在场上总会有起伏，你不需要太在意人们的称赞和批评，”科比说道，“你只需要做好应该做的事情，发挥出最高的水平。”就象科比所说的，与爵士队交锋他们只需要打出自己的最高水平即刻。包括季后赛，湖人队在主场已连续17次击败爵士队，自从2006年1月2日起他们就没有在主场输给过爵士队。上周六做客盐湖城时，湖人队逆转最多17分落后战胜对手，他们有五人得分上双，明天他们同样需要进攻中能有多点开花的表现。爵士队近况糟糕，他们已经遭遇八连败，自2005年3月5日-20日后他们就没有过九连败，2004-05赛季是他们27年来唯一一个胜率不到五成的赛季。可输给国王队后，他们距离赛季胜率不足五成只差一场败仗。爵士队战绩不佳，伤病是一个原因，德文-哈里斯、安德烈-基里连科、拉加-贝尔都受到伤病困扰，这削弱了他们的实力。基里连科和贝尔恐怕无法在洛杉矶复出，哈里斯要取决于赛前的情况。不过在内线爵士队还有艾尔-杰弗森和保罗-米尔萨普，他们两人都有很强的冲击力，他们的发挥直接影响球队在洛杉矶的命运。预计双方首发阵容湖人队：费舍尔、科比、阿泰斯特、奥多姆、拜纳姆爵士队：沃特森、海沃德、迈尔斯、米尔萨普、杰弗森(Melody)	西班牙人,科比,科比-布莱恩特,杰弗森,安德鲁-拜纳姆,贝尔,迈尔斯,加索尔,保罗-米尔萨普,拉玛尔-奥多姆,阿泰斯特,沃特森,安德烈-基里连科,拉加-贝尔,保罗-加索尔,奥多姆,菲尔-杰克逊,哈里斯,德文-哈里斯,基里连科,海沃德,费舍尔	正向	"Jazz VS Lakers: Kobe Bryant has a heavy responsibility on his shoulders. The purple and gold army sent people nine consecutive defeats. Sina Sports News On April 5, Beijing time, Paul Gasol has not retired this season. If he can continue to play, the Los Angeles Lakers (55-21) should be able to extend their home winning streak against the Utah Jazz (36-41). The Lakers, who have just ended their nine game winning streak, are in urgent need of a comeback. Kobe Bryant and his teammates will not miss any chance to win at home. After losing to the Nuggets, the Lakers ended their nine consecutive games, and the gap between them and the Spurs, the leader of the West, was widened to two and a half games. However, compared with the impact of the top seed in the West, the Lakers value the health of the players, but bad things often come together. Gasol was fouled by Nene when he dunked in the third quarter, and his right knee was hit by his opponent. After examination, the Spaniard's right knee was bruised, and it remains to be seen until before the game whether he can play or not. ""In fact, I feel much better than yesterday, which is a good sign. I feel good."" Gasol told the journalist. Gasol feels good about himself, but is Phil Jackson willing to take risks? After all, the Lakers are the team that wants to win the championship. A game of the regular game is not so important, so the ""Zen Master"" may arrange for Gasol to have a rest. Andrew Bynum also suffered a knee injury in the game against the Nuggets. His situation was much better and he should be able to play tomorrow. With Bynum and Lamar Odom, the Lakers' internal line can ensure a certain competitiveness, which may also lead to Gasol being arranged to have a rest. The importance of Gasol in the interior is self-evident. If he can't play, other insiders must give the team more help. As the leader of the team, Kobe is not to be outdone to take more responsibilities. The Lakers need five more victories to reach 60 victories. Previously, Jackson led the team to win 60 victories and successfully won the championship. ""There will always be ups and downs on the court, and you don't need to care about people's praise and criticism,"" Kobe said. ""You just need to do what you should do and play at the highest level."" As Kobe said, they only need to play their highest level in their battle with the Jazz. Including the playoffs, the Lakers have beaten the Jazz 17 times in a row at home. Since January 2, 2006, they have never lost to the Jazz at home. Last Saturday, when they visited Salt Lake City, the Lakers reversed the highest 17 point loss to their opponents. Five of them scored in double figures. Tomorrow, they also need an attack that can have many flowers. The Jazz are in a bad situation. They have suffered eight consecutive losses. Since March 5-20, 2005, they have never had nine consecutive losses. The 2004-05 season was the only season in 27 years with a winning rate of less than 50%. However, after losing to the Kings, they were only one defeat away from the winning rate of less than 50% in the season. The poor performance of the Jazz is due to injuries. Devin Harris, Andre Kirilenko and Raja Bell are all injured, which weakens their strength. Kirilenko and Bell are afraid that they can not return to Los Angeles. Harris depends on the situation before the game. However, the Jazz still have El Jefferson and Paul Millsap in the interior, both of whom have strong impact. Their performance will directly affect the fate of the team in Los Angeles. The expected starting lineup of both sides: Lakers: Fisher, Kobe, Artest, Odom, Bynum Jazz: Watson, Hayward, Miles, Millsap, Jefferson (Melody)"

周二A股市场继续上扬沪指收复3200今日投资周二A股市场继续上扬，沪指收复3200点。上证指数收于3235.36点，涨1.25%；深圳成指收于13682.2点，涨1.45%。两市A股共有1520只股票上涨，73只股票下跌。成交金额有所放大，上海市场从上一交易日的1638亿升至1947亿元；深圳市场从1071亿元增加到1223亿元。受芝加哥采购经理人指数好于预期以及金融股上涨带动，美股周一小幅上扬。11月芝加哥采购经理人指数从10月的54.2上升至56.1,高于53.0的市场预期。道指与标准普尔500指数本月均上涨了5%以上，创自7月以来最大单月涨幅。2009年11月，全国制造业采购经理指数(PMI)为55.2%，与上月持平。该指数已连续九个月位于临界点50%以上，表明制造业经济总体保持平稳回升态势。这显示出在一系列“保增长”的宏观调控政策作用下，当前中国经济已基本熨平由国际金融危机带来的异常波动。在未来一段时期之内，政府投资的力度将逐步趋于平缓，经济增长将逐步由政府投资主导的复苏向市场自我良性复苏进行转变，因此短期内，经济可能缺乏进一步提升的动力，而呈现出持续稳步回升的态势。在前期一系列宏观经济调控措施的作用下，经济增长正在朝着企稳向好的方向发展，对未来中国经济的增长仍然保持乐观的预期。大盘蓝筹弱于中小市值股票，中国石化涨0.08%，中国石油涨0.22%，中国平安涨0.48%。国家医保目录正式发布，医药板块全线上扬，康缘药业涨6.47%。中央财政将投入900多亿用于污水行业，环保类股票则延续强势表现，菲达环保涨停。海南的国际旅游岛建设引起中央媒体的广泛关注，海南国际旅游岛获批在即，海南板块开始走强，罗顿发展涨5.43%。产品价格上涨空间大的行业近期走势强劲，包括钢铁、水泥、部分化工产品等，宝钢股份涨7.83%，冀东水泥涨6.15%。另外，造纸、家具和纺织机械等板块居涨幅前列，船舶制造、金融和传媒娱乐等板块相对较弱。市场快速调整后传言很多，虽然每个消息都没得到证实和证伪，也无法解释市场下跌时板块联动关系，但是却成为理解市场调整的理由。同时机构的担忧情绪也在增强，担忧是否会像8月份下跌那样引发连锁反应。从多数机构的观点来看，他们认为市场不会像8月份下跌一样引起连锁反应，并基本认可目前A股市场调整的幅度已经基本到位。虽然在中央经济工作会议召开之前，市场对政策的担心会仍然存在，短期市场还将呈现震荡格局。待宏观政策调控思路进一步明朗后，市场有望再现升势，股指中枢震荡上行是大趋势。		正向	"On Tuesday, the A-share market continued to rise, and the Shanghai Stock Index recovered 3200. On Tuesday, the A-share market continued to rise, and the Shanghai Stock Index recovered 3200. The Shanghai Stock Index closed at 3235.36 points, up 1.25%; The Shenzhen Composite Index closed at 13682.2, up 1.45%. A total of 1520 stocks of A-shares in the two cities rose and 73 fell. The trading volume has increased. The Shanghai market rose from 163.8 billion yuan on the previous trading day to 194.7 billion yuan; The Shenzhen market increased from 107.1 billion yuan to 122.3 billion yuan. The US stock market rose slightly on Monday, driven by the better-than-expected Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index and the rise of financial stocks. The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index in November rose from 54.2 in October to 56.1, higher than the market expectation of 53.0. The Dow Jones Index and the S&P 500 Index have both risen by more than 5% this month, the largest single month rise since July. In November 2009, the national manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 55.2%, the same as last month. The index has been above the critical point of 50% for nine consecutive months, indicating that the manufacturing economy as a whole is maintaining a stable recovery trend. This shows that the current Chinese economy has basically smoothed out the abnormal fluctuations caused by the international financial crisis under the influence of a series of macro-control policies of ""growth protection"". In the coming period, the strength of government investment will gradually tend to moderate, and economic growth will gradually change from a recovery dominated by government investment to a self benign recovery of the market. Therefore, in the short term, the economy may lack the motivation to further improve, but it will show a trend of continuous steady recovery. Under the influence of a series of macroeconomic regulation measures in the earlier period, economic growth is developing in the direction of stabilizing and improving, and we still maintain an optimistic expectation of the future growth of the Chinese economy. The large market blue chip is weaker than small and medium-sized market value stocks. Sinopec rose 0.08%, China National Petroleum Corporation rose 0.22%, and Ping An of China rose 0.48%. The national medical insurance catalog has been officially released, and the pharmaceutical sector has risen across the board. Kangyuan Pharmaceutical rose 6.47%. The central government will invest more than 90 billion yuan in the sewage industry, and environmental protection stocks continue to perform strongly, Feida Environmental Protection stops rising. The construction of Hainan International Tourism Island has attracted the wide attention of the central media. Hainan International Tourism Island has been approved, and Hainan Province has begun to strengthen. Luodun Development has risen 5.43%. The industry with large price increase space of products has been strong recently, including steel, cement, some chemical products, Baosteel shares rose 7.83%, Jidong Cement rose 6.15%. In addition, the paper making, furniture and textile machinery sectors are among the top gainers, while the shipbuilding, finance and media entertainment sectors are relatively weak. There are many rumors after the market adjusts rapidly. Although each news has not been verified or falsified, and it is also impossible to explain the sector linkage relationship when the market falls, it becomes the reason to understand the market adjustment. At the same time, the worry of institutions is also increasing, worrying whether it will trigger a chain reaction like the decline in August. From the perspective of most institutions, they believe that the market will not cause a chain reaction like the decline in August, and basically agree that the current adjustment of A-share market has basically reached the level. Although the market's worries about policies will still exist before the central economic work conference is held, the market will still show a volatile pattern in the short term. After the macro policy regulation idea is further clarified, the market is expected to rise again, and the central trend of the stock index is rising."

阿巴斯呼吁以色列对加沙地带军事行动不要升级新华网拉姆安拉12月22日电(记者赵悦杨媛媛)巴勒斯坦民族权力机构主席阿巴斯22日对以色列近来连续轰炸加沙地带的做法发出警告，呼吁以对加沙地带的军事行动不要升级。阿巴斯是在会见欧盟驻巴勒斯坦地区代表克里斯蒂安·贝尔热时作上述表示的。他说，以色列对加沙地带采取任何新的军事行动都会对和平进程造成严重影响，将导致国际社会为巴以和平所付出的努力遭受失败。阿巴斯向欧盟代表介绍了以色列拒绝在被占领土上停建犹太人定居点后巴以局势的最新发展，并呼吁欧盟在巴以和平进程中发挥更多作用。近日，以色列派遣战机及坦克轰炸加沙地带的军事行动增多，主要打击控制着加沙地带的巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动(哈马斯)的军事据点等目标。在从20日深夜至21日晚不到24小时的时间内，以色列战机共对加沙地带发动10次轰炸，造成6名巴勒斯坦人受伤。以军方称，这是对加沙地带武装人员向以色列发射火箭弹的回应。近来，以军与加沙地带武装人员冲突频发。据以色列军方统计，今年双方已发生约100起冲突，包括双方交火、发射火箭弹和定点空袭等。2008年12月27日至2009年1月18日，以色列以阻止加沙地带武装人员向以发射火箭弹为由，对加沙地带发动了代号为“铸铅行动”的大规模军事打击，造成1400多名巴勒斯坦人丧生、5500多人受伤。	赵悦,贝尔热,杨媛媛,阿巴斯	负向	"Abbas called on Israel not to upgrade the military operation in the Gaza Strip Xinhua News Agency, Ramallah, December 22 (Reporter Zhao Yue, Yang Yuan Yuan) Palestinian President Abbas warned on the 22nd that Israel's continuous bombing of the Gaza Strip recently, and called on Israel not to upgrade the military operation in the Gaza Strip. Abbas made the above remarks when he met Christian Berger, the representative of the EU in the Palestinian area. He said that any new military action of Israel in the Gaza Strip would have a serious impact on the peace process, which would lead to the failure of the efforts made by the international community for peace in Palestine and Israel. Abbas introduced the latest developments in the situation in Palestine and Israel to the EU representative after Israel refused to stop building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and called on the EU to play a greater role in the peace process between Palestine and Israel. In recent days, Israel has increased its military operations of sending fighters and tanks to bomb the Gaza Strip, mainly targeting military strongholds and other targets controlled by the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Gaza Strip. In less than 24 hours from the night of the 20th to the night of the 21st, Israeli fighters launched 10 bombings on the Gaza Strip, injuring six Palestinians. The Israeli military said it was in response to the rocket launch by armed personnel in the Gaza Strip to Israel. In recent days, the conflict between the Israeli army and the armed personnel in the Gaza Strip has occurred frequently. According to the statistics of the Israeli military, the two sides have had about 100 conflicts this year, including firing, rocket launching and定点air raids. From December 27, 2008 to January 18, 2009, Israel launched a large-scale military strike codenamed ""Cast Lead Operation"" in the Gaza Strip in order to prevent the armed personnel in the Gaza Strip from launching rockets to Israel, causing more than 1400 Palestinian deaths and more than 5500 injuries."

《肉中刺》重庆热拍斯琴高娃宋春丽破不和传闻本报讯(记者刘咏戈)近日，由俞钟执导，孙逊、斯琴高娃、宋春丽等人主演的谍战戏《肉中刺》在重庆拍摄。昨日，记者驱车来到剧组拍摄地渝北龙兴古镇，斯琴高娃正在拍摄来渝后的第一场戏，正是与宋春丽的对手戏。之前传闻两人在拍摄电视剧《娘》后闹翻，甚至一度拒绝同台演出。但昨日面对记者，两人不仅分吃零食还亲密地探讨剧本，大秀姐妹情。斯琴高娃打封闭拍戏斯琴高娃在剧中饰演国民党一位高官的母亲，身份尊崇，因有亲共行为而遭到保密局特务的暗杀。而宋春丽则饰演斯琴高娃的好姐妹，身份是地下党的副书记。记者在现场看到，两人的戏份是边包饺子边闲话家常，有亲戚带人来看家里的古董。但就这一场戏反复拍了一下午，刚刚赶到重庆的斯琴高娃明显很疲惫，在拍摄间歇还拿出一个药箱，倒出好几种药服用，斯琴高娃苦笑着告诉记者，她是打着封闭坚持演戏的：“我腿脚不好是老毛病了，这几天还感冒了，嗓子也不好。来的时候刚打的封闭，针头直接打进肘部骨头了，否则根本不能坚持。”一旁的宋春丽则关切地拿出一袋话梅，“吃吃这个吧，提神还润喉。”于是两人一边同吃话梅一边聊起了各自身体状况。不是姐妹胜似姐妹之前《娘》剧热播荧屏的时候，曾有媒体披露两大主演宋春丽跟斯琴高娃严重不和，甚至在参加某档节目录制时拒绝同台。宋春丽曾对此作出过澄清，但斯琴高娃从未对此做出回应。昨日再次同场飚戏，斯琴高娃坦言很过瘾：“我不想回应那些无聊的报道，越说越错，你们也看到了，我们没有什么飙不飙戏，一切都很自然。在戏外，我们无话不谈，都这把年纪了，我们都很珍惜彼此的感情。要说我们不和的，请他来现场看看。”言罢，斯琴高娃拿着剧本与宋春丽探讨起来，期间有说有笑。	刘咏戈,俞钟,斯琴高娃,孙逊,宋春丽	正向	"""The Thorn in the Flesh"" is a hot shot in Chongqing. S琴 Gao and Song Chunli break the news that I (Reporter Liu Yongge) recently, the spy drama ""The Thorn in the Flesh"" directed by Yu Zhong and starring Sun Xun, S琴 Gao, Song Chunli and others is being shot in Chongqing. Yesterday, the reporter drove to Longxing Ancient Town in Yubei, where S琴 Gao was shooting his first play after coming to Chongqing, which was exactly the opposite of Song Chunli. Previously, it was rumored that the two broke up after shooting the TV drama ""Mother"", and even refused to perform on the same stage for a time. But yesterday,面对the reporter, the two not only shared snacks but also discussed the script intimately, showing sisterhood. S琴 Gao plays a closed play in which S琴 Gao plays the mother of a high-ranking Nationalist official in the play, who is respected because of her pro communal behavior and is assassinated by the special agents of the Confidential Bureau. Song Chunli plays the good sister of S琴 Gao, whose identity is the deputy secretary of the underground party. The reporter saw at the scene that their play was to have dumplings while chatting. Relatives brought people to see the antiques at home. But this play was shot for an afternoon. S琴 Gao, who had just arrived in Chongqing, was obviously very tired. During the shooting, he also took out a medicine box and took several medicines. S琴 Gao smiled bitterly at the reporter and said, ""I have been playing a closed play because my legs and feet are not good. I have a cold these days and my throat is not good. When I came, I had just got a closed hand. The needle was directly injected into the elbow bone, otherwise I could not stick to it."" Song Chunli, on the other side, took out a bag of loquat, ""Eat this, it can refresh your mind and moisturize your throat."" So the two talked about their physical condition while eating loquat. When the drama ""Mother"" was popular on the screen before, the media revealed that Song Chunli and S琴 Gao were seriously inharmonious, and even refused to share the stage when participating in the recording of a program. Song Chunli has made a clarification on this, but S琴 Gao has never responded. Yesterday, once again, S琴 Gao frankly said, ""I don't want to respond to those boring reports. The more you say, the worse. You can see that we have nothing to do with the play. Everything is very natural. Outside the play, we have nothing to talk about. We are all at this age, and we all cherish each other's feelings. If you say we are not in harmony, please let him come to the scene."" After that, S琴 Gao took the script to discuss with Song Chunli, and there was a lot of talk and laughter during the process."

At the same time, the net profit of China Netcom in the first half of the year reached 5.877 billion yuan, up 11.9% compared with the same period in 2007. China Netcom said that this was mainly due to the impact of factors such as tax rate changes and non cash transaction income. China Netcom's traditional fixed telephone business was severely challenged in the first half of 2008, especially the local fixed telephone users continued to lose and their income continued to decline. As of June 30, the number of local telephone users of China Netcom was 108 million, a decrease of 2.31 million from the end of 2007, including 1.49 million fixed telephones and 811000 Xiaolingtong.

The fixed telephone and Xiaolingtong investment ratio was only 4.4%, down 13.2 percentage points from the same period last year. At a time when the fixed network voice business has shrunk dramatically, China Unicom announced that it would vigorously expand the innovative business represented by broadband, and the broadband service revenue increased by 38.8% to 8.859 billion yuan, accounting for 21.8% of the total revenue, 6.1 percentage points higher than the same period last year. As of June 30, the total number of China Netcom broadband users reached 23.36 million, higher than 17.12 million in the same period of the previous year, and the number of broadband users increased to 23.98 million by the end of July. Li Fushen, CFO of China Netcom, said that the company plans to add 8 million broadband users every year from 2008 to 2010. - China News Network (China News, reporter Zhao Jin) Yesterday, China Unicom (00762.

Introduction: Faye Wong, the queen of heaven, has become a fashion effect in the entertainment industry. That is, whenever Faye Wong wears something, uses something or says something, it will become the focus of the public and the media. From travel to food, clothing, housing and transportation. Want to know what clothes Faye Wong wears and what bags she carries? Then follow her with the editor in a hurry. Faye Wong's appearance at the premiere of the movie ""Will Love"" was the biggest highlight of the whole press conference. The black and white dress was really lovely with the naughty red scarf and red shoes. But the most eye-catching thing is the pink crystal bear iPhone (mobile phone online) 4 mobile phone case that Sister Fei has begun to show off at the concert in Taiwan. Although I don't know what brand this crystal mobile phone case is, it has been a hit on the Internet because of Wang Fei's love. All kinds of customized prices are very expensive, but there is still a promising future with the charm of Faye Wong. Faye Wong wears a pair of red leather shoes, black fat lantern trousers, a white loose shirt and a black long coat. The simple and unconventional dress is paired with a clean make-up, which is so calm and charming that only Faye Wong can be beautiful. The loose shirt with irregular white hem, black lantern trousers and red large head shoes are very stylish, but I think it will be impossible for another person to wear such charm in a simple way. Faye Wong recently appeared in a tide dress in a certain place. Although the overall dress style is not bright enough, it is simple but fashionable. The wide shoulder waist design of the gray tweed overcoat is both atmospheric and very prominent. A blue gray Longchamp handbag is very eye catching. This handbag is also the basic classic style of the brand, which has been sought after for many years. The大气'style, practical texture and economical price are also very kind to Sister Fei."
专家支招：自考常见题型的答题方法四、几种常见题型的答题方法1、单项选择题：如果能很快地、准确地把正确答案找出来最好，如果没有把握，就应采用排除法，即应从排除最明显的错误备选项开始，把接近正确答案的备选项留下，再分析比较剩下的备选项，进一步逐一否定，最终选定正确答案。其实，许多单项选择题的4个备选项中，除1个正确外，其余3个并非完全错误，只是不符合此题目的要求而已，有的备选项是命题者从其他章节中移植过来作为干扰项。看一下题目顺序，再回忆对照教材的顺序，就能作出正确选择。2、多项选择题：许多多项选择题往往出自于某一基本问题，命题者把该问题的几个要点作为正确选项。干扰项当中，有的干扰项一看就知道是错误的，则立即排除，而有的干扰项是无法一下判定对错的，甚至其本身就没错，只是被放错了位置，同单项选择题一样，看命题和教材顺序选择，依然有效。另外，选中后，一定要按照字母A、B等备选项顺序书写。3、名词解释：答案要简练、概括、准确，只要理解了。用自己的话去解释也可以，不必拘泥于原文。如答不上，则顾名思义，根据题目去猜想、解释其义。4、简答题：要努力地搜索记忆中的答案要点，作答时，答案要有层次性，要突出要点并且工整地写在试卷上，语言要做到简洁明了。不管想出了几点，作答时一定要分段，切忌把几个要点写在一个自然段之中。5、论述题：列出答案要点，然后对要点逐一展开叙述，把自己的能力全部发挥出来，要在深度上和广度上努力，内容多多益善。必要时，可以先在草稿纸上列出答案要点，思考一下，看能阐述多少。如果时间紧张，那就直接把几个要点作答在试卷上（注意分段并留一定空白以备叙述），然后发挥形象思维能力，千万不要怕胡思乱想，尽可能地对要点进行展开叙述。坚决做到在答案要点的基础之上多些内容。五、弥补1、选择题的弥补。单项选择题当中如果还有几个怎么也做不出的话，干脆孤注一掷，统一选择一个备选项，即统一选择或A、或B、或C、或D.一般来讲，找回一分没问题，运气好的话，有时会找回更多分。多项选择题难度就大多了，实在想不出的话，ABCDE全部都选上，效果如何，就看运气了。2、非选择题的弥补。对每一道选择题的题目及答案（包括不正确的选项）和已经做好的其他非选择题的题目及答案进行反复阅读，有时会一下猛然醒悟而反应过来。如果还是不行，那就只有编写一些答案要点写上，但编写的东西必须是所考课程的内容，而不要张冠李戴，并从宏观角度出发（即下大包围）去阐述，尽量做到自圆其说。六、休息考完一科后，找地方去休息吧，千万不要参加考生之间的议论或互相对答案，也不要自己看书对答案。考过的已经过去，再想都无用，应抓紧时间清醒头脑，此时，越放松越好，这实际上是为考好下一科做的精神准备。七、小结以上技巧有五、六个大点及17、8个小点，考生朋友如果都运用得好，即每一点均能够“意外”地至少多得1分的话，合计起来就是20分左右，效果是不言而喻的。结语。千技巧万技巧，最根本的技巧还是努力地学习知识、掌握知识。综合笔者多年的自考经验，最有效的技巧是做到以下几点：1、熟悉大纲。《考试大纲》是学习和考核的依据，对课程的知识点、考核要求、难易程度、考试题型等作了规定。推荐——全国高等教育自学考试委员会颁布的《考试大纲》。2、钻研教材。教材是《考试大纲》所规定课程知识的具体化和系统阐述，考题均出自教材。推荐——全国高等教育自学考试委员会指定的教材。3、借助辅导用书。辅导用书是帮助消化、理解大纲和教材的老师。建议选用不仅能帮助顺利通过自考，还能够提高思维能力、记忆能力等综合能力的辅导用书。推荐——《自考专科公共课图表速记》和《自考本科公共课图表速记》（四川人民出版社出版）4、掌握学习方法。良好的学习方法能达到事半功倍的效果。推荐——《自考方法谈》（在www.zikao211.com搜索）。5、运用考试技巧。推荐——本文。考生朋友做好以上几点，一定能够做到一次过关。更多信息请访问：新浪自考频道自考论坛自考博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。		正向	"Experts' advice: four methods of answering common questions in self-examination, 1. Single choice questions: It is best to quickly and accurately find out the correct answer. If there is no guarantee, the elimination method should be used, that is, the most obvious wrong options should be eliminated first, leaving the options close to the correct answer, then analyze and compare the remaining options, further negate them one by one, and finally select the correct answer. In fact, in the four options of many single choice questions, in addition to 1 correct one, the other three are not completely wrong. They just do not meet the requirements of this question. Some options are transferred from other chapters by the proposer as interference items. Look at the order of the questions, then recall the order of the textbook, and you can make the right choice. 2. Multiple choice questions: Many multiple choice questions often come from a basic question, and the test question sets several key points of the question as the correct option. Among the interference items, some interference items can be immediately eliminated because they are obviously wrong, while others can not be judged right or wrong at once, or even there is nothing wrong with them, but they are in the wrong place. Like the single choice question, look at the proposition and the order of the textbook to choose, which is still effective. In addition, after selecting, be sure to write in the order of options A, B and so on. 3. Definition of terms: The answer should be concise, summary and accurate. Just understand it. You can also explain it in your own words, and you don't have to stick to the original text. If you can't answer, just take the name literally and guess and explain its meaning according to the question. 4. Simple questions: Try to search for the key points of the answer in your memory. When answering questions, the answer should be hierarchical, highlighting the key points and neatly written on the examination paper. The language should be concise and clear. No matter how many points you think of, you must divide them into paragraphs when answering questions. Never write several key points in a natural paragraph. 5. Discussion questions: List the key points of the answer, and then expand the key points one by one. Try your best to develop your abilities in depth and breadth. The more content, the better. If necessary, you can first list the key points of the answer on the draft paper, think about it, and see how much you can explain. If time is tight, just write several key points on the examination paper (pay attention to segmentation and leave some space for narration), and then give full play to your imaginal thinking ability. Never be afraid of wild thinking, and try to expand the key points. We must do our best to add more content on the basis of the key points of the answer. 5. Make up for 1. Make up for the choice questions. If there are still several single choice questions that you can't do, you might as well take a desperate move and choose one option, that is, choose A, B, C or D. In general, there is no problem in getting back one point. If you are lucky, you will get back more points at times. Multiple choice questions are much more difficult. If you really can't think of them, select ABCDE, and the effect depends on luck. 2. Make up for non-choice questions. Read repeatedly the title and answer of each choice question (including incorrect options) and the title and answer of other non-choice questions that have been completed. Sometimes, you will suddenly wake up and respond. If it still doesn't work, you can only write some key points of the answer, but what you write must be the content of the course you are going to take, not Zhang Guan Li Dai, and start from a macro perspective (that is, make a large encirclement) to elaborate, and try to make sense of it. 6. Have a rest. After passing one subject, go to have a rest. Do not participate in the discussion or answer questions among examinees, or read books to answer questions. The test is over. It's useless to think about it. You should seize the time to clear your head. At this time, the more relaxed you are, the better. This is actually a mental preparation for doing well in the next subject. 7. Summary The above skills have five or six major points and 17 or 8 small points.

用友伟库网创新思维SaaS应用步入快车道7月8日，用友在线正式宣布激活伟库网(www.wecoo.com)，用作新的SaaS业务运营平台，以新平台、新技术、新模式、新应用为主要特点，专注于打造企业的贴心“好管家”。有评论认为，厚积薄发的用友SaaS一举树立了在业界的比较优势。10日在宁波，国内规模最大、最权威的第二届中国软件运营服务大会——“2008SaaS在中国”隆重举行，100多家软件提供商、互联网公司、电信和增值业务提供商，以及200多家企业用户参加了此次盛会。用友软件携伟库网独揽“中小企业类”产品创新大奖，并被评价为“最有潜力SaaS厂商”。“2008SaaS在中国”——第二届软件运营服务大会主题定位于“SaaS应用切入与创新”，这与用友一贯坚持的理念不谋而合。“获得中小企业类的创新奖，表明业界对用友的市场定位、客户需求理解及不断探索新产品的战略高度高度认可”。一位参会的专业人士对此表示。随着伟库网的正式运行，用友以“草根思维”创新SaaS理念，从中小企业切入，以不断创新的产品服务于企业管理与商务。“力做亚洲SaaS市场的领头羊”，用友软件高级副总裁兼在线事业部总经理杨祉雄信心满怀。“草根思维”创新SaaS服务理念2008年初，用友SaaS尚在研发阶段，就提出了“服务于中小型企业”的定位。和行业的竞争对手相比，在SaaS业务运作上，用友的起步似乎略显晚了一点。早在两年前，已有企业高调地宣称推出SaaS服务；市场方面，关于SaaS的相关话题及舆论炒作也相继而来。然而直到今天，目前国内尚没有任何一家公司在SaaS业务上获得切切实实、具有足够说服力的成绩。计世资讯的一位专家对这个新兴市场做了一番解读：有的产品只定位于电子商务，有的集中于财会，而对于有着4200万中小型企业市场的管理软件产品，却很缺乏。正是基于这点，用友在经过前期的充分市场调研，后期历时一年的研发，在“沉寂”了两年后提出了“草根思维”的客户定位策略。“用友SaaS锁定入门级用户，服务最为广泛的草根企业。”杨祉雄说：这些大多是50人以下，营业额在1000万元以下，业务经营相对单一，管理较为简单，大多是初创型公司。对于目标市场的清晰界定，这一创新理念体现了用友在SaaS领域独具慧眼。“创新不一定就是在业内第一个敢于尝试进军新的领域，提出更为先进、有效的理念或服务形式，更能体现其创新的核心价值所在。”计世咨讯的这位专家表示，从软件在线运营的产业视角来看，用友的积淀具有相当的竞争优势，这也让诸多专家纷纷看好用友SaaS。不难看出用友在SaaS业务运作上的深思熟虑。一方面，几乎所有的SaaS厂商都将目标用户锁定在中小企业，但是对于草根企业的关注并不多，用友恰恰在竞争激烈的SaaS市场找到了一片蓝海，而这个领域又如此之大，足以对用友的SaaS业务形成有力的支撑。受到服务成本、需求成熟度等因素的影响，50人以下的小型企业用户往往被传统管理软件厂商视为“非经济客户”、成为管理软件“市场中的长尾”。基于对企业管理特征和需求的把握，用友对不同规模的客户进行细分实现全生命周期的客户经营，并提出用SaaS模式满足初创型小企业的管理与商务需求，这样用友就实现了对不同规模、不同阶段用户的全面涵盖。只做概念对行业的发展未必有利，SaaS作为一种新模式被推出，必定要体现其技术架构上的先进性、服务理念上的创新、更加安全可靠的运维平台、以及更先进的应用和服务支持。业内一位人士对SaaS的发展提出了更深刻的思考。	杨祉雄	正向	"On July 8, Yonyou Online officially announced the activation of Weiku Network (www.wecoo.com) as a new SaaS business operation platform, focusing on creating a considerate ""good housekeeper"" for enterprises, with the main characteristics of new platform, new technology, new model and new application. It is commented that Yonyou SaaS, which has accumulated thick and thin, has established a comparative advantage in the industry. On the 10th day in Ningbo, the second largest and most authoritative China Software Operation Service Conference in China - ""SaaS in 2008"" was grandly held, with more than 100 software providers, Internet companies, telecommunications and added value service providers, and more than 200 enterprise users attending the conference. Yonyou Software, together with Weiku Network, won the ""Small and Medium Enterprises"" product innovation award and was evaluated as ""the most potential SaaS manufacturer"". ""SaaS in 2008"" - the theme of the Second Software Operation Service Conference is positioned as ""SaaS application cutting in and innovation"", which coincides with the consistent adherence of Yonyou. ""Winning the innovation award of small and medium-sized enterprises shows that the industry highly recognizes the market positioning, customer needs understanding and the strategy of constantly exploring new products of Yonyou"". A professional participant said. With the official operation of Weiku Network, Yonyou innovated the SaaS concept with ""grass root thinking"", focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, and served enterprise management and business with constantly innovative products. ""Be the leader of the Asian SaaS market"", Yang Zhixiong, Senior Vice President of Yonyou Software and General Manager of the Online Division, is full of confidence. ""Grass root thinking"" innovates the SaaS service concept. At the beginning of 2008, when Yonyou SaaS was still in the R&D stage, it proposed the positioning of ""serving small and medium-sized enterprises"". Compared with the industry competitors, Yonyou seems a little late in the operation of SaaS business. As early as two years ago, some enterprises had announced the launch of SaaS services in a high-profile manner; In the market, the relevant topics and public opinion speculation about SaaS have also come one after another. However, up to now, no company in China has achieved substantial and convincing results in the SaaS business. An expert of World News made an interpretation of this emerging market: some products are only positioned in e-commerce, some focus on accounting, and there is a lack of management software products for the 42 million small and medium-sized enterprise market. It is based on this point that Yonyou proposed the customer positioning strategy of ""grass root thinking"" after two years of ""silence"" following a full market research in the early stage and a year of research and development in the later stage. ""Yonyou SaaS focuses on entry-level users and serves the most extensive grassroots enterprises."" Yang Zhixiong said: These are mostly start-up companies with less than 50 people, less than 10 million yuan in business turnover, relatively single business operations and relatively simple management. The clear definition of the target market reflects Yonyou's unique vision in the SaaS field. ""Innovation does not necessarily mean that it is the first in the industry to try to enter a new field, but it is more advanced and effective to propose concepts or service forms, which reflects its core value of innovation."" said the expert of World News and Information, from the perspective of the industrial perspective of software online operation, Yonyou's accumulation has considerable competitive advantages, which also makes many experts optimistic about Yonyou SaaS. It is not difficult to see that Yonyou has given careful consideration to the operation of SaaS business. On the one hand, almost all SaaS manufacturers have targeted small and medium-sized enterprises, but there is not much attention to grass root enterprises. Yonyou has found a blue sea in the fierce SaaS market competition, and this field is so large that it can form a strong support for Yonyou's SaaS business. Influenced by factors such as service cost and demand maturity, small enterprise users with less than 50 people are often regarded as ""non economic customers"" by traditional management software manufacturers and become the ""long tail"" of management software in the ""market"". Based on the grasp of the characteristics and needs of enterprise management, Yonyou subdivides customers of different scales to achieve full life cycle customer management, and proposes to meet the management and business needs of small enterprises at the start-up stage with the SaaS mode, so that Yonyou realizes the comprehensive coverage of users of different scales and stages. Doing concepts is not necessarily beneficial to the development of the industry. As a new model, SaaS must reflect its advanced technology architecture, innovation of service concept, more secure and reliable operation and maintenance platform, and more advanced application and service support. An industry insider has put forward a deeper thinking on the development of SaaS"
《极速赛车手》专为儿童拍摄周日全面公映(图)本报讯8月10日，《极速赛车手》将在内地影院全面上映，这是奥运会期间首部上映的好莱坞大片。该片是继《黑客帝国()》系列后，沃卓斯基兄弟的首部导演作品，中国演员余男(blog)和韩国偶像Rain(听歌)参与。另外，IMAX巨幕版本也将同时上映。故事小学生都能看懂自2003年《黑客帝国》系列结束后，沃卓斯基兄弟休息了整整3年，这期间只监制了一部《V字仇杀队》。《极速赛车手》是专门拍给少年儿童看的电影，所以在这部电影中你看不到复杂的故事和哲学思考，只剩下如万花筒一般绚烂的色彩和小学生都能看懂的故事。为了表达两兄弟对日本动漫大师吉田龙夫原作的怀念，全片大量采用绿幕拍摄，背景甚至模拟成了二维动画。赛车“马赫5号”空中换胎《极速赛车手》中的赛车“马赫5号”尽显威力，在片中大玩超越、漂移、翻转、碰撞等动作，还具有空中换胎、发射子弹等功能。导演还借助近1000个电脑特效镜头，将“马赫5号”和它的竞争对手放到沙漠、雪山等地比赛。演员余男与Rain扮姐弟为迎合亚洲市场，出品方华纳兄弟邀请中国演员余男、韩国偶像Rain、日本明星真田广之参演，其中余男和Rain在片中扮演姐弟。	沃卓斯基,余男,吉田龙夫,Rain	正向	"""Speed Racer"", a film shot for children, was fully released on Sunday (picture) On August 10, ""Speed Racer"" will be fully released in mainland cinemas, the first Hollywood blockbuster during the Olympic Games. The film is the first director's work of the Wachowski brothers after the ""Matrix ()"" series, with Chinese actor Yu Nan (blog) and Korean idol Rain (listening music) participating. In addition, the IMAX giant screen version will also be released at the same time. The story has been understandable to primary school students since the end of the ""Matrix"" series in 2003. The Wachowski brothers took a full three years off. During this period, they only produced ""V for Vendetta"". ""Speed Racer"" is a film shot for children and teenagers, so in this film, you can't see complicated stories and philosophical thinking, but only the colorful colors like a kaleidoscope and the stories that primary school students can understand. In order to express the brothers' memory of Yoshitaka Yoshida, the original work of Japanese animation master, the whole film adopts a large number of green screen shooting, and even the background is simulated into two-dimensional animation. The racing car ""Mach 5"" changes tires in the air. The racing car ""Mach 5"" in ""Speed Racer"" shows its power. It plays a lot of actions such as overtaking, drifting, flipping and collision in the film, and has the functions of air tire change and bullet launching. The director also used nearly 1000 computer special effects cameras to put ""Mach 5"" and its competitors in the desert, snow mountain and other places for competition. Yu Nan and Rain, the actors who play as brothers and sisters, cater to the Asian market. Warner Bros., the producer, invited Chinese actor Yu Nan, South Korean idol Rain and Japanese star Hideaki Sanada to play as brothers and sisters in the film."
大福证券建议增持国泰航空目标价18港元大福证券国泰于2008年蒙受巨大亏损86.96亿元，乃主要由于金融海啸及其后油价暴跌导致大额燃油对冲亏损所致，该公司于2009年转亏为盈，录得纯利46.94亿元(每股盈利：1.19元)。业绩强劲反弹，乃归因于业务逐步恢复、有效成本控制、因燃油价格反弹而显着拨回燃油对冲亏损，以及出售其于港机工程(0044.HK,$100.40)的部分股权所致。该公司宣派末期及年内唯一的股息每股0.10元，亦是2008年下半年因宏观环境艰难而暂停派息以来首次重新派息。若不计算非经常性项目，国泰的基础业绩则由2008年的亏损17.34亿元扭转为2009年的溢利8.52亿元。国泰于2009年的客运及货运收益分别按年下跌21%及30%，使该公司的收入按年下降23%至670亿元，反映行业衰退情况。由于头等及商务外游人数减少，以及经济客位价格受压，故乘客数量按年下降2%，而收益率则锐减20%，货运业务方面，货运量及收益率分别下降7%及27%。总营运成本按年下跌34%，其中燃油及非燃油成本分别按年减少63%及4%。由于燃油采购成本按年下跌49%，以及于2008年入帐的燃油对冲亏损80亿元中已拨回28亿元，故燃油仅占2009年总营运开支的28%，较去年骤减23个百分点。国泰维持其对冲未来12个月预计耗油量最少30%的目标。其未平仓燃油对冲合约的收支平衡水平为每桶80美元。于2009年为已届满的燃油对冲合约支付32亿元平仓后，国泰于2009年的债务净额仅按年上升4%至261亿元，相当于净负债比率62%，较去年下降7个百分点，但仍高于目标的50%水平。展望将来，我们预期对该公司业务的需求只会逐步复苏，因为需求下降部分属结构性而非纯粹周期性，同时，燃油价格回升的威胁亦是另一影响业务的因素。可幸的是，由于香港乃区内重要的空运中心，故国泰的形势仍较其全球同业优胜。我们继续建议增持该股，调整后的目标价为18.00元，相当于市净率1.7倍或预计企业价值对扣除利息、税项、折旧及摊销前盈利的比率9.7倍。分析员：曹福达	曹福达	正向	Dafu Securities suggested to increase the target price of Cathay Pacific to HK $18 per share. Cathay Pacific suffered a huge loss of 8.696 billion yuan in 2008, mainly due to the financial tsunami and the subsequent sharp drop in oil prices, which led to huge fuel hedging losses. The company turned from loss to profit in 2009, with a profit of 4.694 billion yuan (earnings per share: 1.19 yuan). The strong rebound of performance is due to the gradual recovery of business, effective cost control, significant reversal of fuel hedging losses due to the rebound of fuel prices, and the sale of some shares in Hongkong Machinery Engineering (0044. HK, $100.40). The company declared a final and only dividend of 0.10 yuan per share, which was also the first dividend since the suspension of dividend distribution in the second half of 2008 due to the tough macro environment. If non recurring items are not counted, Cathay Pacific's underlying performance will reverse from a loss of 1.74 billion yuan in 2008 to a profit of 852 million yuan in 2009. Cathay Pacific's passenger and freight revenue fell 21% and 30% respectively in 2009, which led the company's revenue to decline 23% year on year to 67 billion yuan, reflecting the industry's decline. Due to the reduction of first class and business trips and the pressure on the price of economy seats, the number of passengers decreased by 2% year on year, while the yield decreased sharply by 20%. In terms of freight business, freight volume and yield decreased by 7% and 27% respectively. Total operating costs fell 34% year on year, of which fuel and non fuel costs fell 63% and 4% respectively. Due to the fact that the fuel procurement cost fell 49% year on year, and 28 billion yuan of the 80 billion yuan fuel hedging losses recorded in 2008 had been written back, fuel only accounted for 28% of the total operating expenses in 2009, a sharp decrease of 23 percentage points from last year. Cathay Pacific maintains its goal of hedging at least 30% of the expected fuel consumption in the next 12 months. The break even level of its open fuel hedging contracts is $80 per barrel. After paying 3.2 billion yuan to close the expired fuel hedging contracts in 2009, Cathay Pacific's net debt for the year only rose 4% year on year to 26.1 billion yuan, equivalent to a net debt ratio of 62%, 7 percentage points lower than last year, but still higher than the target level of 50%. Looking ahead, we expect that the demand for the company's business will only gradually recover, because the decline in demand is partly structural rather than purely cyclical, and the threat of rising fuel prices is another factor affecting the business. Fortunately, as Hong Kong is an important air transport center in the region, Cathay Pacific still has an advantage over its global peers. We continue to recommend to increase the stock, and the adjusted target price is 18.00 yuan, which is equivalent to 1.7 times or 9.7 times of the expected earnings per share of the company's net price-earnings ratio.

东南区巡礼：榜眼秀力助闪电侠大将军拖奇才后腿魔术莫里斯·埃文斯的离队和白人前锋加里蒂的退役，让魔术队的2、3号位出现了危机。主教练大范甘迪引进了皮特鲁斯和新秀考特尼·李，同时将使用雷迪克和博甘斯两名旧将，共四人试验得分后卫位置，皮特鲁斯和雷迪克有望脱颖而出。皮特鲁斯是摇摆人，防守能力尚可，并能远投，这些都是魔术队亟需补强的。雷迪克有成为优秀投手的潜力，但如果他的表现仍不够稳定，只会再度沦为替补得分后卫。34岁的安东尼·约翰逊将会是控卫杰米尔·尼尔森的第一替补，约翰逊上赛季场均得5.6分3.8次助攻。奇才罗杰·梅森上赛季为奇才队场均贡献个人职业生涯最高的9.1分，他改投马刺是奇才替补席上的一大损失。奇才队今夏的主要任务是和两名主将阿里纳斯、贾米森续约，引援动作并不大，重点补强的位置是组织后卫。由于阿里纳斯受伤，丹尼尔斯将出任先发组织后卫，新引进的迪克森和迪·布朗则将出任第二和第三替补。迪克森上赛季远投命中率达到41.7%。新秀麦克基身高2.13米，将是球队在内线的重点培养对象，先发中锋海伍德曾吹捧他为全联盟运动能力排前三的中锋。老鹰老鹰队的阵容调整在上赛季就已完成，今夏并没有特别大的动作。丘尔吉斯的出走和萨利姆·斯塔德迈尔的离队，是后场的巨大损失，但新来的莫里斯·埃文斯并非等闲之辈，他能打得分后卫和小前锋两个位置，上赛季场均贡献个人职业生涯最高8.9分，他将是小前锋马文·威廉姆斯的第一替补，并有望成为球队的第六人。穆雷同样经验丰富，先后曾在骑士、活塞队等队效力，将作为得分后卫乔·约翰逊的首席替补。中锋莫里斯曾身披尼克斯队战袍，能增加内线实力，总体来说，老鹰队今夏实力变化不大。山猫山猫队没有对主力阵容进行任何调整。小个子博伊金斯今夏选择去了意大利博洛尼亚队。选中第9号新秀控卫奥格斯丁是山猫今夏最引人注目的引援动作。奥格斯丁是可塑之材，但他身高只有1.83米，必须认真当好费尔顿的替补。不过，奥格斯丁最终会在1号位置上得到更多上场时间，甚至有可能迫使费尔顿去改打得分后卫。新来的香侬·布朗将成为球队第三替补得分后卫，上赛季他在骑士队和公牛队场均进账5.4分。热火榜眼秀比斯利的加盟无疑是对韦德的最大帮助。比斯利身体素质出众，假以时日，他可以超越马里昂，成为热火队的二号人选。加拿大籍中锋马格洛尔曾是全明星球员，他将缓解布朗特在内线的压力。第34号新秀查尔默斯在新秀培训课程班上被查出携带大麻，并连累比斯利被罚5万美金，查尔默斯将出任先发控卫班克斯的替补。为防止“白巧克力”离队后控卫位置实力大降，热火队还引进了利文斯顿，不过利文斯顿的健康状况令人担忧，他自2007年2月以来就没有参加过正式比赛。	大范甘迪,迪·布朗,迪克森,丘尔吉斯,博洛尼亚,雷迪克,丹尼尔斯,约翰逊,莫里斯·埃文斯,施耐德,杰米尔·尼尔森,贾米森,马里昂,安东尼·约翰逊,加里蒂,博甘斯,比卢普斯,莫里斯,查尔默斯,斯塔德迈尔,布鲁克斯,马格洛尔,班克斯,利文斯顿,白巧克力”,香侬·布朗,博伊金斯,埃文斯,考特尼·李,比斯利,韦德,麦克基,奇才,杰拉德·加里蒂,梅森,穆雷,阿联,马文·威廉姆斯,中锋莫里斯,奥格斯丁,罗杰·梅森,阿里扎,白巧克力,大将军,费尔顿,海耶斯,拉德马诺维奇,博洛尼亚队,马特·巴恩斯,雷阿伦,白人前锋加里蒂,皮特鲁斯,范甘迪,布朗特,海伍德,阿泰斯特,老鹰,阿里纳斯	正向	"Southeast Tour: The No. 2 show helps Flash General Drag Wizard Hawke Magic Morris Evans leave and the retirement of the white forward Garyti, which creates a crisis for the Magic's No. 2 and No. 3 positions. Head coach Da Fangan introduced Pietrus and rookie Courtney Lee, and will use two old generals, Reddick and Bogans. Four people will be tested in the shooting guard position, and Pietrus and Reddick are expected to stand out. Pietrus is a swingman with considerable defensive ability and can make a long shot, which is an urgent need for the Magic to strengthen. Reddick has the potential to become an excellent shooter, but if his performance is still unstable, he will only become a substitute shooting guard again. Anthony Johnson, 34, will be the first substitute for point guard Jamil Nelson. Johnson scored 5.6 points and 3.8 assists per game last season. Roger Mason of the Wizards contributed a personal career high of 9.1 points per game last season, and his transfer to the Spurs is a big loss on the Wizards' bench. The main task of the Wizards this summer is to renew the contracts with the two main players, Arenas and Jamison. There is not much reinforcement. The key position is point guard. Due to Arenas' injury, Daniels will serve as the starting point guard, and the newly introduced Dickson and DeBrown will serve as the second and third substitutes. Dickson's long shot hit rate last season reached 41.7%. The rookie McGee, 2.13 meters tall, will be the focus of the team's training in the interior. Haywood, the starting center, praised him as the center of the top three in the league in terms of athletic ability. The lineup adjustment of the Eagles has been completed last season and there is no special move this summer. The loss of Churgis and Salim Stadmai is a huge loss in the back court, but the new Maurice Evans is not an ordinary person. He can play in two positions, shooting guard and small forward. Last season, he contributed a personal career high of 8.9 points per game. He will be the first substitute for the small forward Marvin Williams and is expected to become the sixth man of the team. Murray is also experienced. He has served in the Cavaliers, Pistons and other teams, and will serve as the chief substitute for shooting guard Joe Johnson. Center Morris once wore the Knicks' uniform, which can increase the internal strength. In general, the Eagles' strength has not changed much this summer. The Bobcats did not make any adjustments to the main lineup. The little man Boykins chose to go to Bologna, Italy this summer. The selection of the ninth rookie point guard Augustine is the most notable move of the Bobcats this summer. Augustine is plastic, but he is only 1.83 meters tall and must take seriously as Felton's substitute. However, Augustine will eventually get more playing time at No. 1 position, and may even force Felton to change his job as a shooting guard. The new Shannon Brown will become the team's third substitute shooting guard. Last season, he averaged 5.4 points per game in the Cavaliers and the Bulls. The joining of Beasley, the No. 2 show in the Heat, is undoubtedly the greatest help to Wade. Beasley has excellent physical fitness. In time, he can surpass Marion and become the second choice of the Heat. Magloire, a Canadian center, was an All Star player, and he will ease Blunt's pressure in the interior. The 34th rookie Chalmers was found to carry marijuana in the rookie training course, and Beasley was fined 50000 dollars, and Chalmers will serve as the substitute for the starting point guard Banks. In order to prevent the power of the point guard from falling sharply after the ""White Chocolate"" team leaves, the Heat team also introduced Livingston, but his health is worrying, and he has not participated in any official games since February 2007."

NYMEX原油期货20日收盘走高[世华财讯]受空头回补的推动，NYMEX原油期货20日收盘走高。NYMEX6月轻质低硫原油期货合约结算价上涨1.1%，至每桶99.49美元。综合媒体5月20日报道，纽约商业交易所(NYMEX)原油期货20日收盘走高，因在消息称盖达组织2010年曾图谋劫持或击沉油轮后，油价获空头回补。NYMEX6月轻质低硫原油期货合约结算价上涨1.05美元，至每桶99.49美元，涨幅1.1%；该品种合约20日到期。美国官员援引从奥萨玛本拉登巴基斯坦驻地收集到的情报称，盖达组织的目的是要刺激油价大涨并触发西方经济危机。但官员补充称，没有迹象显示正在策划任何特定或很快有恐怖袭击。油价盘中走势振荡，最低曾跌至每桶95.99美元，因美元走强以及在6月合约收盘到期前的结清仓位，但午盘时走势逆转，最高触及每桶99.89美元。一些分析师表示，20日价格大幅波动可能是因6月合约流动性不足以及技术面压力。根据美国石油协会(API)的月度供需报告，美国4月原油及成品油总需求较上年同期跳升5.2%至每日1,988.6万桶。交易员们亦相信长期原油需求处于上升趋势，因美国进入夏季驾车出行季，且中国等新兴市场的燃料需求增加。Purvin&Gertz分析师表示，交易员们把19日油价的下滑看成是一个买进的机会，因为地缘政治风险目前暂时还得不到有效的解决办法，或将不会看到剧烈的下跌。NYMEX6月RBOB汽油期货结算价上涨0.98美分，至每加仑2.9358美元，涨幅0.3%；6月取暖油期货结算价上涨2.36美分，至每加仑2.9183美元，涨幅0.8%。ICE7月交割的北海布伦特原油期货价格上涨97美分，报收于每桶112.39美元，涨幅为0.9%。(师卫娟编辑)	奥萨玛本拉登	正向	The NYMEX crude oil futures closed higher on the 20th [Shihua Financial News] driven by short covering, the NYMEX crude oil futures closed higher on the 20th. The settlement price of NYMEX June light low sulfur crude oil futures contract rose 1.1% to 99.49 dollars per barrel. The comprehensive media reported on May 20 that the NYMEX crude oil futures closed higher on the 20th. After it was reported that Al Qaeda had tried to hijack or sink tankers in 2010, oil prices were covered by shorts. The settlement price of NYMEX June light low sulfur crude oil futures contract rose $1.05 to $99.49 per barrel, up 1.1%; The contract of this kind expires on the 20th. US officials, citing intelligence collected from Osama bin Laden's Pakistan mission, said that the purpose of Al Qaeda was to stimulate a sharp rise in oil prices and trigger a Western economic crisis. But the official added that there was no indication that any specific or imminent terrorist attack was being planned. Oil prices fluctuated during the trading day, hitting a low of $95.99 a barrel because of the strengthening of the US dollar and the closing of positions before the June contract closed, but the trend reversed at noon, hitting a high of $99.89 a barrel. Some analysts said that the sharp fluctuation of prices on the 20th may be due to the lack of liquidity of the June contract and technical pressure. According to the monthly supply and demand report of the American Petroleum Institute (API), the total demand for crude oil and petroleum products in the United States in April jumped 5.2% year on year to 19.886 million barrels per day. Traders also believe that long-term crude oil demand is on the rise because the United States has entered the summer driving season and fuel demand has increased in emerging markets such as China. Purvin & Gertz analysts said that traders regard the decline of oil prices on the 19th as an opportunity to buy, because the current geopolitical risks can not be effectively solved for the time being, or they will not see a sharp decline. The settlement price of NYMEX June RBOB gasoline futures rose 0.98 cents to $2.9358 per gallon, up 0.3%; The settlement price of June heating oil futures rose 2.36 cents to $2.9183 per gallon, up 0.8%.

日政府考虑上调收入税企业税支持重建[世华财讯]消息人士表示，日本政府正考虑在未来5至10年上调收入税及企业税税率方案，开源节流进行融资支持重建受重创的东北部地震灾区。综合媒体8月16日报道，消息人士表示，日本政府正考虑考虑提高收入所得税和企业税的税率，以筹集资金用于地震和海啸灾后东北地区的重建。消息人士称，政府正对于上调收入所得税的两个方案进行考虑，一个是在未来10年将收入所得税上调5%，另一个是在未来5年将收入税上调10%。两个方案均会产生大约7万亿日圆，折合913亿美元的财政收入。2010年年底时，日本首相菅直人表示，从2011财年起(始于4月1日)将日本40%的企业税下调5%，以促进出口、提振国内疲软的经济。这样的减税将会令日本的税收每年减少1.4至2.1万亿日圆，相当于2010财年财政收入的4%至5%。但因受到强震及海啸影响，造成巨大的财政缺口，日本政府正在考虑将上述企业税减税计划进行推迟，日本总债务水平占其GDP比重已超200%，此举可以避免通过大规模新发国债来筹集灾后重建资金，与此同时，日本政府还在考虑增加企业税，在未来5年产生大约4万亿日圆的财政收入，以支持重建工作。7月5日，日本政府批准了2万亿日元的追加预算，用于东北部地震灾区的重建，具体包括对受灾民众进一步提供经济援助、给予地方政府财政补贴，同时留出8000亿日元资金用于日后重建工作，并准备发行新债务及出售国有资产等措施进行进一步融资。日本政府预计要以用10年时间，耗资23万亿日圆来重建遭311超级大地震肆虐的地区。目前只有6万亿日圆已在第1次与第2次的追加预算案中获得通过，意味在头5年的重建工作中，还需筹措13万亿日圆。(牛??编译)	菅直人,牛??	正向	The Japanese government is considering raising income tax and corporate tax to support reconstruction [Shihua Financial News] Sources said that the Japanese government is considering raising income tax and corporate tax rates in the next 5 to 10 years to finance and support the reconstruction of the hard hit Northeast earthquake area. Comprehensive media reported on August 16 that sources said the Japanese government was considering raising the income tax rate and corporate tax to raise funds for the reconstruction of the earthquake and tsunami affected areas in Northeast China. Sources said that the government was considering two options for raising income tax, one was to increase income tax by 5% in the next 10 years, and the other was to increase income tax by 10% in the next 5 years. Both schemes will generate fiscal revenues of about 7 trillion yen, equivalent to 91.3 billion US dollars. At the end of 2010, Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that from the fiscal year 2011 (starting from April 1), Japan's 40% corporate tax would be reduced by 5% to promote exports and boost the domestic weak economy. Such tax cuts will reduce Japan's tax revenue by 1.4 trillion to 2.1 trillion yen each year, equivalent to 4% to 5% of fiscal revenue in the fiscal year of 2010. However, due to the strong earthquake and tsunami, a huge financial gap has been caused. The Japanese government is considering delaying the above-mentioned corporate tax reduction plan. Japan's total debt level has exceeded 200% of its GDP, which can avoid raising funds for post-disaster reconstruction through massive new national debt. At the same time, the Japanese government is also considering increasing corporate taxes to generate fiscal revenue of about 4 trillion yen in the next five years to support reconstruction. On July 5, the Japanese government approved an additional budget of 200 billion yen for the reconstruction of the earthquake stricken area in Northeast China, including providing further economic assistance to the victims, giving financial subsidies to local governments, leaving 80 billion yen for future reconstruction, and preparing to issue new debts and sell state assets for further financing. The Japanese government is expected to spend 23 trillion yen in 10 years to rebuild the areas ravaged by the 311 super earthquake.

热刺欲劫阿森纳1500万猎物铁闸从未说过想去枪手新浪体育讯　号称“暴力本”的布莱克本上赛季防守强悍，他们的中卫搭档功不可没。有“新特里”之称的菲尔-琼斯，在夏窗开启伊始就被曼联抢购；而现在，他们的队长克里斯-桑巴也成了转会市场上的香饽饽。据《每日邮报》报道，热刺已经提升了他们对桑巴的兴趣，桑巴的经纪人将在近几天内同两位潜在买家——阿森纳和热刺展开转会谈判。看来，热刺不但在赛场上同阿森纳是德比死敌，在转会方面也想和枪手正面交锋，一争高下。这个夏天，热刺没有同伍德盖特续约，前英格兰国脚成为自由球员之后被斯托克城签下；莱德利-金做了膝盖手术，无缘季前备战。仅有加拉、道森、卡布尔、巴松四员中卫，在雷德克纳普看来，是无法应付英超、欧联杯、足总杯、联赛杯多线作战的，因而，老雷将目光投向了桑巴。据悉，桑巴的标价是1500万英镑。《太阳报》日前曾报道，桑巴亲口表示想加盟阿森纳，但桑巴坚称他从未说过这样的话。他在推特上发布了一条微博：“关于我的报道完全是假的——我从没说过那些话。我是布莱克本球员，我永远不会说想要加盟别的俱乐部，那是对东家的不尊重。我现在很不开心。”(哈利)	菲尔-琼斯,巴松,哈里,莱德利-金,雷德克纳普,桑巴,克里斯-桑巴,加拉,杰拉德,伍德盖特,特里,道森,老雷,本	正向	"Tottenham Hotspur wants to raid Arsenal's 15 million prey, the iron gate of Tottenham Hotspur has never said that he wants to go to the Arsenal Sina Sports News, which is called ""Violent Ben"". Blackburn's defense was tough last season, and their central defender partner contributed a lot. Phil Jones, known as ""New Terry"", was snapped up by Manchester United at the beginning of the summer window; now, their captain Chris Samba has also become a popular target in the transfer market. According to the Daily Mail, Tottenham have stepped up their interest in Samba, and Samba's agent will have a transfer negotiation with two potential buyers - Arsenal and Tottenham - in the coming days. It seems that Tottenham, like Arsenal, are derby rivals on the field, and they also want to have a face-to-face battle with the Gunners in terms of transfer, and compete with each other. This summer, Tottenham did not renew their contract with Woodgate. After becoming a free agent, the former England international was signed by Stoke City; Ledley King had a knee operation and was out of the pre-season preparation. Only four central defenders, Gallas, Dawson, Cabul, and Basson, in the view of Redknapp, are unable to cope with the multi-line battle of the Premier League, the Europa League, the FA Cup and the League Cup. Therefore, the old Lei focused on Samba. It is reported that Samba's price tag is 15 million pounds. The Sun recently reported that Samba said he wanted to join Arsenal, but Samba insisted that he had never said so. He posted a microblog on Twitter: ""The report about me is completely false - I never said such words. I am a Blackburn player, and I will never say that I want to join other clubs, which is disrespectful to my boss. I'm very unhappy now.""(Harry)"
王小帅做客新浪谈父子情王天冉斩获音乐大奖新浪娱乐讯6月6日下午15：00，导演王小帅(微博)与儿子王天冉、其音乐老师李海川(点击进入其blog)做客新浪嘉宾聊天室。王小帅畅聊入围今年戛纳电影节的新片《日照重庆》，10岁的儿子王天冉与其老师分享勇夺音乐界大奖——美国纽约卡内基音乐比赛金奖的辛苦与欣慰。王小帅戛纳得知儿子获奖喜讯拿鲜花迎接儿子凯旋主持人赵宁：欢迎各位新浪网友，我是主持人赵宁。很多朋友都知道王小帅导演在前段时间凭借新片《日照重庆》去参加了戛纳影展，尽管这部片子并没有在戛纳上获奖，但是在戛纳期间他听说了一个非常大的好消息，就是他的儿子王天冉在美国卡内基音乐节上获得大奖，为此他也说这个奖项比他所有的奖项都来得开心，今天我们也很开心能够邀请到王小帅导演，以及刚刚获奖归来的王天冉和他的音乐老师李海川一起做客新浪，欢迎我们的三位嘉宾(掌声)，欢迎三位！李海川：谢谢，谢谢。主持人赵宁：再次恭喜小天冉。王天冉：谢谢。主持人赵宁：这是你人生当中的第一个大的奖项吧。王天冉：对。主持人赵宁：有没有让你当时说获奖感言来着。王天冉：没有。主持人赵宁：如果当时说获奖感言会怎么说，有想过吗？王天冉：有想过，我和我妈妈都安排过。主持人赵宁：安排了，以前设计了，当时是怎么设计的？王天冉：先谢谢各位评委会主席，再谢谢李海川老师，再说那些感言之类的。主持人赵宁：怎么没有说谢谢爸爸呢？王小帅：就是。主持人赵宁：不好意思说吗？王天冉：家里人都谢谢了。王小帅：都准备了。王天冉：对。主持人赵宁：当时儿子在美国参加比赛的时候王导正好那段时间是在戛纳是吗？王小帅：那天卡内基演那个曲子的那一天，23号，正好也是戛纳那一天23号闭幕，我们是24号的票回来，23号正好我在戛纳。主持人赵宁：那段时间有同时关注儿子在那边的比赛情况吗？王小帅：没有，他演出那一天实际上已经得奖，已经知道是得了金奖。得了金奖之后有一个演出。主持人赵宁：之后就看到你在北京等待着儿子归来，然后特别到机场等了三个多钟头，是不是？王小帅：那天我们去早了倒是真的，飞机也稍微晚了点。主持人赵宁：反正在家里也等不住，就去机场。王小帅：不能错过走出来的那一瞬间，得让他看到鲜花，有一点觉得很有成就感。王天冉：嗯。主持人赵宁：看着爸爸拿着鲜花在出关的地方等着。王天冉：很兴奋。主持人赵宁：他从来都没有用这种方式表达过他对你的……王天冉：没有过。主持人赵宁：第一次给你送花。王天冉：对。主持人赵宁：当时他说什么了？王天冉：就说“真不错呀儿子，继续努力”，把鲜花给我，然后我妈妈给我照了几张相。主持人赵宁：我听说当时你还挺酷的，说“这没什么”，有之类的表示吗？王天冉：没有。王天冉童言无忌得奖很开心没想到爸爸会喜极而泣主持人赵宁：当时是一个什么样的心情。王天冉：挺开心的，这次能够获得这个奖。王小帅：你就说没事，挺正常，也行，没问题，不用说官话，嗯，挺好，得奖了，下次再来，继续努力。主持人赵宁：后来有听说爸爸还专门为你要庆祝好几天呢，有吗？有在北京回来再有什么其它庆祝方式吗？或者买什么礼物送给你，满足你长久的一个心愿？王天冉：那天晚上回来就给我一束花，带我吃一顿饭就没了。主持人赵宁：那顿饭怎么样？王天冉：挺好吃的，我特爱吃。王小帅：他平时爱吃的那几种饭。王天冉：煲仔饭、粉丝什么的。王小帅：他第二天就上课，六一也没放假。主持人赵宁：但是你知道吗，我听说在戛纳的时候，当王小帅导演听到自己儿子获奖的消息传来喜极而泣。王小帅：喜极而泣听不懂？主持人赵宁：就是爸爸流泪了，听到你获奖之后哭了，而且哭了很长的时间。王天冉：这事没有给我讲过。王小帅：没有想到爸爸会哭是吗？王天冉：没有。王小帅：不会，爸爸在你面前不会哭，背地里，那是高兴、激动的。因为那个时候接到电话。在北京出发前，接到这个消息是海川老师说了这个事。给我妈打电话，给他奶奶打电话，确实高兴激动得哭了。因为爷爷刚刚离开，没有看到孙子取得这个成绩。老师李海川介绍纽约卡内基音乐奖王天冉是最年轻获奖者主持人赵宁：赶紧介绍一下音乐老师李海川，李海川老师应该是陪同着天冉整个参加在美国的比赛。李海川：这个比赛一直是他妈妈陪着他去，因为我在中国音乐学院当钢琴老师，学校的教学量非常大，非常繁忙，当时也是思想斗争一番，我觉得还是给天冉自己一个锻炼机会，本来应该是陪同他一起去，但是因为我有自己的本职工作，不能够请假，所以还是天冉的妈妈主要是做出了很多投入在里面。包括平时学琴，他的妈妈也陪他做了很多投入跟牺牲。主持人赵宁：这个音乐奖项叫纽约卡内基音乐奖。李海川：这个奖在国内是级别很高的一个比赛，大家看到天冉只有10岁的一个小朋友，他是获奖选手里最年轻的一位。这个比赛还有成人组在里边，成人组有很多是世界各地的专业院校钢琴专业的学生。那就是身经百战，在国际上参加过很多大赛，包括像他这个年龄可能就参加过大赛的人去参加这次比赛。其实当时我们送天冉去参加这个比赛，就只是抱着一个尝试的心态，给他一个机会，让他去看到天外有天，尝试着去锻炼自己，而且去争取这么一个学习观摩的机会。所以当时他得了第一名，我们也觉得挺意外的。当然他很有实力，但是这跟他自己平时的努力还是分不开的。这次比赛竞争很激烈。主持人赵宁：因为是5—18岁的这个组。李海川：对，而且一共是1700多位选手，来自六大洲，世界各地31个国家的参赛选手，这是大赛组委会公布的。主持人赵宁：从音乐老师的角度，你觉得天冉获得这个第一名主要的原因是什么，他在钢琴学习方面的天赋或者是独到的地方？	王天冉,李海川,赵宁,王小帅	正向	"Wang Xiaoshuai, a guest of Sina, talked about his father and son. Wang Tianran won the music prize. Sina Entertainment News At 15:00 pm on June 6, Director Wang Xiaoshuai (microblog) and his son Wang Tianran, and his music teacher Li Haichuan (click to enter his blog) visited Sina guest chat room. Wang Xiaoshuai talked about the new film ""Chongqing on Sunny Day"" which was shortlisted for this year's Cannes Film Festival. His 10-year-old son Wang Tianran shared with his teacher the hardships and comfort of winning the music industry's top prize - the gold medal of the New York Carnegie Music Competition. Wang Xiaoshuai learned that his son had won the good news in Cannes and welcomed his son back with flowers. Host Zhao Ning: Welcome Sina netizens. I am the host Zhao Ning. Many friends know that Director Wang Xiaoshuai went to the Cannes Film Festival with his new film ""Chongqing on Sunny Day"" some time ago. Although the film did not win the prize in Cannes, he heard a very good news during the Cannes Festival that his son Wang Tianran won the prize at the Carnegie Music Festival in the United States, and he also said that the prize was happier than all his prizes. Today, we are also very happy to invite Director Wang Xiaoshuai, and Wang Tianran, who has just won the prize, and his music teacher Li Haichuan to Sina. Welcome our three guests (applause). Welcome! Li Haichuan: Thank you. Host Zhao Ning: Congratulations to Xiaotianran again. Wang Tianran: Thank you. Host Zhao Ning: This is your first major award in your life. Wang Tianran: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: Did you make a speech when you won the prize at that time? Wang Tianran: No. Host Zhao Ning: If you said something at that time, what would you say? Have you thought about it? Wang Tianran: Yes, my mother and I have arranged it. Host Zhao Ning: Arrange, design before, how to design at that time? Wang Tianran: First of all, thank you, the chairman of the jury, then thank you, Teacher Li Haichuan, and then say something like that. Host Zhao Ning: How come you didn't say thank you to Dad? Wang Xiaoshuai: That's it. Host Zhao Ning: Sorry to say? Wang Tianran: Thank you all at home. Wang Xiaoshuai: All ready. Wang Tianran: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: When his son was in the United States for the competition, Director Wang was in Cannes, right? Wang Xiaoshuai: That day, the 23rd day of the Carnegie performance of that song was exactly the 23rd day of the closing of Cannes. We came back on the 24th. I was exactly in Cannes on the 23rd. Host Zhao Ning: Did you pay attention to the competition of your son at that time? Wang Xiaoshuai: No, he has actually won the prize on the day of his performance, and he knows that he has won the gold medal. There is a performance after winning the gold medal. Host Zhao Ning: Later, I saw you waiting for your son to return to Beijing and then waited at the airport for more than three hours. Yes? Wang Xiaoshuai: We really went early that day, and the plane was a little late. Host Zhao Ning: Anyway, I can't wait at home, so I went to the airport. Wang Xiaoshuai: I can't miss the moment when I come out. I have to let him see flowers. I feel very accomplished. Wang Tianran: Mm-hmm. Host Zhao Ning: Looking at his father holding flowers and waiting at the customs. Wang Tianran: Very exciting. Host Zhao Ning: He has never expressed his wishes to you in this way... Wang Tianran: Never. Host Zhao Ning: Give you flowers for the first time. Wang Tianran: Yes. Host Zhao Ning: What did he say at that time? Wang Tianran: Just say ""Son, well done, keep on working"", give me flowers, and then my mother took some photos of me. Host Zhao Ning: I heard that you were pretty cool at that time and said ""It's nothing"", and there was no such thing as an expression? Wang Tianran: No. Wang Tianran's child speaks without scruples. It's very happy to win the prize. I didn't expect my father to weep with joy. Host Zhao Ning: What was the feeling at that time? Wang Tianran: Very happy, I was able to win this award this time. Wang Xiaoshuai: Just say it doesn't matter, it's normal, it's OK, there's no need to say anything, well, it's good to win the prize, come again next time, and continue to work hard. Host Zhao Ning: Later, I heard that my father also wanted to celebrate for several days for you. Did he come back to Beijing for other celebrations? Or buy some gifts for you to satisfy your long wish? Wang Tianran: When I came back that night, I gave me a bunch of flowers and had a meal, and that was it. Host Zhao Ning: What about the dinner? Wang Tianran: Very delicious, I love to eat. Wang Xiaoshuai: The meals he usually likes. Wang Tianran: Clay pot rice, fans and so on. Wang Xiaoshuai: He went to class the next day, and he didn't have a holiday on June 1. Host Zhao Ning: But do you know, I heard that when Director Wang Xiaoshuai heard that his son had won the prize when he was in Cannes, he was so happy that he cried. Wang Xiaoshuai: I don't understand the joy of weeping? Host Zhao Ning: That is, my father shed tears and cried for a long time after hearing that you had won the prize. Wang Tianran: This is not something to tell me. Wang Xiaoshuai: I didn't expect Dad to cry, did you? Wang Tianran: No. Wang Xiaoshuai: No, Dad will not cry in front of you, secretly, he is happy and excited. Because I received a phone call at that time. Before leaving for Beijing, my mother was told by Haichuan teacher. Call my mother, call his grandmother, and really cry with joy. Because Grandpa has just left and has not seen his grandson achieve this result. Teacher Li Haichuan introduces that Wang Tianran is the youngest winner of the New York Carnegie Music Award. Host Zhao Ning: Hurry up to introduce the music teacher Li Haichuan. Teacher Li Haichuan should accompany Tianran to participate in the competition in the United States. Li Haichuan: His mother has always accompanied him to this competition, because I am a piano teacher at the China Conservatory of Music. The school's teaching workload is very heavy and very busy. At that time, I also struggled with my thoughts. I think it is still a good opportunity for Tianran to exercise himself. Originally, I should have accompanied him, but I have my own job and can not ask for leave, so it is still Tianran's mother who has made a lot of investment in it. Including learning the piano in the future, his mother also accompanied him to make many investments and sacrifices. Host Zhao Ning: This music award is called the New York Carnegie Music Award. Li Haichuan: This award is a high-level competition in China. You can see that Tianran is only 10 years old. He is the youngest winner. There is also an adult group in this competition, and many of them are piano students of professional colleges and universities around the world. That is, we have experienced many battles and participated in many international competitions, including people of his age who have participated in the competition. In fact, when we sent Tianran to participate in this competition, we just wanted to have a try, give him a chance, let him see that there is a sky beyond the sky, try to exercise himself, and strive for this opportunity to learn and observe. So when he won the first place, we also felt quite surprised. Of course, he is very powerful, but it is inseparable from his own efforts. The competition was fierce this time. Host Zhao Ning: Because it is a group of 5-18 years old. Li Haichuan: Yes, and there are a total of more than 1700 competitors from six continents and 31 countries around the world. This is announced by the organizing committee of the competition. Host Zhao Ning: From the perspective of a music teacher, what do you think is the main reason why Tianran won the first place, his talent or unique place in piano learning?"
罗马机场开始试行全身扫描安检新华网罗马3月4日电(记者王昀加)意大利首台全身扫描安检设备4日在罗马菲乌米奇诺机场投入试用。针对反对者认为全身扫描仪有可能危害人身健康、泄露个人隐私的忧虑，意大利卫生部长法齐奥、基础设施与运输部长马泰奥利当天参加在菲乌米奇诺机场举行的启动仪式时希望市民不必担心。他说：“我们的研究证明全身扫描仪不会对健康造成任何危险。”意大利民航总局局长里焦表示，全身扫描仪在设计时已经考虑到保护个人隐私的需要，在实际操作时扫描影像将被迅速删除。他强调，在未来4个到6个月的试用期内，乘客将自行选择是否接受全身扫描仪的检查。据报道，意大利原计划今年2月开始试用全身扫描仪，但由于“需要进行完善的准备工作”，试用推迟至今。意大利内政部长马罗尼今年1月份曾表示，将在3个月内开始在罗马菲乌米奇诺、米兰马尔彭萨和威尼斯三个机场试用全身扫描仪，重点检查飞往美国、英国、以色列等国的“敏感”国际航班。2009年12月25日，一名尼日利亚人乘坐达美航空公司航班从荷兰阿姆斯特丹飞往美国底特律，在飞机降落前企图引爆随身携带的爆炸装置，但未成功。这起未遂袭击事件给美国和欧盟敲响了安全警钟，许多国家都加强了航空安检力度。据报道，全身扫描仪利用一种名为毫米波的电磁波，能够“看穿”被扫描者的衣服，精确显现出人体曲线与携带的任何枪支、刀具和爆炸物等。此前，机场全身扫描仪的使用曾引发欧盟内部激辩。	里焦,王昀加,马泰奥利,法齐奥,马罗尼	正向	"The Rome Airport began a trial of a full-body scanning security check. Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 4 (Reporter Wang Yunjia) The first full-body scanning security check equipment in Italy was put into trial use at Fiumicino Airport in Rome on the 4th. In view of the concerns of the opponents that the full-body scanner may endanger personal health and disclose privacy, Fazio, the Italian Minister of Health, and Matteoli, the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport, hoped that the public need not worry when they attended the launching ceremony held at Fiumicino Airport on the same day. He said: ""Our research has proved that full-body scanners will not cause any danger to health."" Riccio, Director of the Italian Civil Aviation Administration, said that the full-body scanner had taken the need to protect personal privacy into consideration when designing, and the scan image will be quickly deleted when it is actually operated. He stressed that passengers will choose whether to accept the examination of the full-body scanner within the 4 to 6 month trial period in the future. It is reported that Italy originally planned to start a trial of the full-body scanner this February, but the trial was postponed until now because ""it needs to be fully prepared"". Italian Interior Minister Maroni said in January this year that he would begin to try out full-body scanners at three airports in Rome Fiumicino, Milan Malpensa and Venice within 3 months, focusing on ""sensitive"" international flights flying to the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel and other countries. On December 25, 2009, a Nigerian took a Delta Airlines flight from Amsterdam, the Netherlands to Detroit, the United States. He tried to detonate the explosive device he carried with him before the plane landed, but failed. The failed attack sounded a security alarm for the United States and the European Union, and many countries have stepped up aviation security checks. It is reported that the full-body scanner uses an electromagnetic wave called millimeter wave, which can ""see through"" the clothes of the scanned person, accurately showing the human body curve and any guns, knives and explosives carried. Previously, the use of airport full-body scanners has triggered a heated debate within the European Union."
韦计划揭幕孙新政内测国奥打中超首战创始人缺席记者傅亚雨香河报道今天(11日)上午，国奥从香河基地出发前往沈阳，12日下午3点，他们将在铁西体育场迎战辽足，韦迪力主推出的国奥打中超计划将正式拉开序幕，这也是新任主帅孙卫的第一场“考试”。作为曾经的辽足十连冠成员，国奥新帅孙卫的“初试”就面对老东家，辽足主帅马林更是他当年的好友。“只要是比赛，我们当然都希望能赢下来，但我已不止一次说过，我不会注重这场的结果，但对过程一定有要求，比赛要有内容。”10日晚，孙卫对本报记者说。对这场比赛的特殊意义，孙卫表示：“还真没想那么多，对我们来说，这只是一场普通的比赛，我们的任务是通过比赛得到锻炼提高，同时进一步查找自身的问题。”孙卫最为人所熟知的经历，毕竟是在辽宁当球员时，对老东家的感情，还是不经意的流露出来，“我对辽宁有非常深厚的感情，在那整整呆了20年，一生最黄金的时代都是在那度过的。我跟球队一起取得了很多成就，创造了辽宁足球最辉煌的历史，我很骄傲。我也一直都在关注着辽宁的足球，今年辽足在中超打得不错，我真替他们高兴。”此番回归，孙卫颇有些衣锦还乡的味道，在家乡父老面前取得一场胜利来证明自己，这当然是最好的事情了。而国奥打中超中甲系列赛，是以韦迪为首的新一届足管中心班子的主要新政之一，首战辽宁，虽然体育总局副局长崔大林还未确定能否成行，韦迪身在南非观摩世界杯，暂时无法分身，但足管中心副主任于洪臣、国管部主任曹景伟都会到现场观战。能够在领导面前打出一场漂亮比赛，对上任就面对质疑的孙卫来说无疑非常有利。“我们这一周训练的核心目标是非常明确的。”孙卫说，在防守方面，希望通过比赛能检验国奥由攻转守环节中的提高，个人位置的选择，还有整体防守队形的组织，都是这一周训练的重点。“这是目前球队防守中存在的最大问题，我们这一周进行了强化训练，当然不能指望一下子就完全解决问题，但我希望能看到进步。”孙卫表示。而在进攻方面，他强调国足已经给国奥队设立了榜样，追求地面进攻、快速反击跟控制球相结合。“希望通过比赛来看看一周训练的效果，是否有改变。”周六的比赛，国奥队是否会有最好的状态？过去一周球队进行了高强度的训练。“队员身体肯定有反应，”孙卫表示，“我们要解决的问题比较多，因此只能靠增加课次、多利用时间来训练。”球员们也感觉很辛苦，但大家精神状态非常好，“这也是对他们意志力的考验，从长远来说我们需要意志力过硬的球员，队员要提高首先要战胜自己，这需要过程，我们不能总在低水平训练中转圈。”孙卫说，球员们也充分理解教练的要求，前锋王刚把自己的QQ签名改成了“疲劳、坚持、提高、再疲劳、再坚持、再提高。”训练量很大，但国奥不会乱上量。集训开始之初孙卫就告诉队员“要准备吃苦但不要害怕”，因为教练会科学地安排训练。6月10日，出征的前一天，教练组调整了训练计划，取消了原定的上午训练，下午的训练也是定位球的攻防，队员们得到了一定的缓冲，晚上的力量训练依旧进行。“队员们的躯干力量、上肢力量非常差，这导致了他们对抗能力弱。因为没力量，他们在身体接触时没自信，很容易丢掉重心从而失去对球的控制，因此力量训练要坚持。”孙卫介绍说。	韦迪,曹景伟,王刚,孙卫,于洪臣,马林,崔大林,傅亚雨	正向	"Wei planned to launch the internal test of Sun's new policy, the founder of the national Olympic team, who was absent from the first battle of the Chinese Super League. Fu Yuyu Xianghe reported this morning (11th), the national Olympic team left Xianghe base for Shenyang. At 3:00 pm on the 12th, they will meet Liaoshu in Tiexi Stadium. Wei Dili's national Olympic team will officially open the Chinese Super League, which is also the first ""exam"" of the new coach Sun Wei. As a member of Liaoshu's ten consecutive champions, the new coach of the National Olympic Games, Sun Wei, faced his former employer in his ""first test"", and Ma Lin, the head coach of Liaoshu, was his good friend at that time. ""As long as it is a game, of course, we all hope to win. But I have said more than once that I will not pay attention to the result of this game, but I must have requirements for the process. The game must have content."" Sun Wei said to the reporter of this newspaper on the evening of the 10th. Sun Wei said of the special significance of this game: ""I didn't think about it so much. For us, it was just an ordinary game. Our task was to get exercise and improve through the game, and at the same time, we should further find our own problems."" Sun Wei's most well-known experience, after all, was to be a player in Liaoning. His feelings for his former employer were still unintentional. ""I have very deep feelings for Liaoning. I have stayed there for 20 years, and the most golden age of my life has been spent there. I have achieved a lot with the team and created the most glorious history of Liaoning football, which I am very proud of. I have also been paying attention to the football in Liaoning. I'm really happy for them this year."" Liu Shu football team played well in the Super League. This time, Sun Wei returned with a taste of returning home in glory. It was certainly the best thing for him to win a victory in front of his hometown to prove himself. The first battle of the National Olympic Team to play in the China Super League and China League A series is one of the main new policies of the new football management center led by Wei Di. The first battle is Liaoning. Although Cui Dalin, Vice Minister of the General Administration of Sports, has not yet decided whether to go or not, Wei Di is in South Africa to watch the World Cup and can not separate for the time being, but Yu Hongchen, Deputy Director of the Football Management Center, and Cao Jingwei, Director of the National Management Department, will all go to the scene for the battle. Being able to play a beautiful game in front of the leadership is undoubtedly very beneficial to Sun Wei, who faces doubts when he takes office. ""Our core goal of training this week is very clear."" Sun Wei said. In terms of defense, it is hoped that the game can test the improvement of the National Olympic team from attack to defense, the choice of personal position, and the organization of the overall defensive team, which are the focus of this week's training. ""This is the biggest problem in the current defense of the team. We have intensified training this week, of course, we can not expect to solve the problem completely at once, but I hope to see progress."" Sun Wei said. In terms of attack, he stressed that the national football team has set an example for the Olympic team, pursuing ground attack, rapid counter attack and ball control. ""I hope to see the effect of a week's training through the game, and see if there is any change."" On Saturday, will the national Olympic team be in the best condition? The team had intensive training in the past week. ""The players must have a reaction,"" said Sun Wei. ""We have many problems to solve, so we can only rely on increasing the number of lessons and making full use of time to train."" The players also felt very hard, but everyone was in good spirit, ""This is also a test of their will. In the long run, we need players with strong will. The players must first overcome themselves to improve, which requires a process. We can not always circle around in low level training."" Sun Wei said that the players also fully understood the requirements of the coach. The forward Wang Gang changed his QQ signature to ""fatigue, persistence, improvement, fatigue, persistence, and improvement again"". The training volume is very large, but the National Olympic Committee will not mess up the amount. At the beginning of the training, Sun Wei told the team members ""to be prepared to suffer but not to be afraid"", because the coach will arrange the training scientifically. On June 10, the day before the launch, the coaching team adjusted the training plan, canceling the scheduled morning training, and the afternoon training was also set piece attack and defense. The team members got some cushion, and the evening strength training still went on. ""The trunk strength and upper limb strength of the team members are very poor, which leads to their weak confrontation ability. Because there is no power, they have no confidence in physical contact, and it is easy to lose the center of gravity and lose control of the ball. Therefore, the strength training must be adhered to."" Sun Wei introduced."

“牵手门”一周年黄维德被传结婚去年11月，伊能静和黄维德被拍到十指紧扣的照片，被外界称为伊能静和庾澄庆离婚导火索。虽然事情已过一周年，但二人的情感生活仍是大众关注的焦点。近日，有传闻称黄维德已结婚，而伊能静则在博客上称“被伤害还是要爱”。近期，伊能静博客频频透露回台北与家人相处的信息，外界猜测，她与庾澄庆的感情可能在回暖。不过，伊能静也透露出她对情感的得失，她在博文《而不管如何》中写到：“不管如何被欺骗还是要诚实”，似乎是在对牵手事件发表周年感触。与此同时，有台湾媒体同行透露，黄维德可能已和相交10余年的女友小陆结婚。“10月他有回台北，有招待亲朋。”对此，有媒体试图向黄维德本人了解情况，但其电话一直无人接听。不过之后，黄维德还是通过短信澄清了自己结婚的消息，但只有短短五个字——“我未婚，谢谢”。综合	小陆,黄维德,庾澄庆,伊能静	正向	"It has been one year since Huang Weide was reported to get married.

Recently, it was reported that Huang Weide had got married, while Yvonne said on her blog that ""she still wants to love when she is hurt"".

中国冶金下半年AH股上市明报报道指，中国冶金科工集团(下称中冶集团)拟在今年上半年向港交所递交招股文件，最快将于09下半年于沪港两地，分别以A、H上市。中冶目前尚未确定具体集资金额，但若成事，估计将创下08年以来本港挂牌新股集资规模之最。央企之一的中冶集团，主要从事海外工程承包、资源开发、纸业、技术装备制造及房地产开发等，是国家确定的重点资源类企业，仅在海外矿山资源投资便达到10亿美元，拥有铁、铜、金、镍、钴、铅、锌、铝等生产企业和矿山资源。集团07年全年总收入175.8亿美元，08年《财富》世界500强排名中位列第480位。据称，担任中冶集团H股承销商的包括摩根士丹利。接近承销人士消息指，上市准备已在操作中，但鉴于近期市?波动剧烈，集资规模及上市时间仍未确定。但去年3月曾有内地媒体报道，中冶计划于08年8月末在两地挂牌，集资总额高达400亿元人民币。但自去年9月始，中国证监会开始冻结A股IPO，中冶上市的计划也暂时搁置。09新年过后，A股指数强势反弹，市场纷传A股IPO有望重新开闸，这或将为中冶A股重新启动招股计划提供契机。市场消息指，中冶拟将除纸业外的所有业务整体上市，但集资规模将大大缩减。锦胜首日挂牌升7%赶上新股“回暖潮”、成功上市集资5800万元的锦胜集团(0794)，昨首日挂牌，未受到早前上市两天便告急跌的瑞金(0246)影响，收市价报1.2元，较招股价高7.1%，未计及手续费，每手可微赚160元。主席庄金洲表示满意股价表现，并指纸价目前相对平稳，料会逐步向好。锦胜获主要供货商玖龙纸业(2689)副行政总裁张成飞，以及理文造纸(2314)行政总裁李文俊入股共7.5%，但两人自招股以来未曾露面支持，直至昨日上市仪式上，玖龙纸业财务总监张元福，以及李文俊之弟李文斌，才各自代表公司到场祝贺。被问到上述策略性股东会否增持或有进一步合作，庄金洲没有直接响应，只表示该两名股东对公司有充分了解及信心，一直有长期的合作关系。至于昨日开始招股的另一只新股亚洲木薯资源(0841)，首日?展表现平平，例如信诚证券只录得100万元，辉立证券更录得零?展。	李文俊,张成飞,李文斌,庄金洲,张元福	正向	"The Ming Pao reported that China Metallurgical Corporation (hereinafter referred to as MCC) intended to submit a prospectus to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in the first half of this year, and it is expected to list in Shanghai and Hong Kong in the second half of 09 as A and H shares. MCC has not yet determined the specific fundraising amount, but if it is successful, it is expected to set the largest fundraising scale of new shares in Hong Kong since 08. MCC, one of the central enterprises, mainly engages in overseas engineering contracting, resource development, paper industry, technology equipment manufacturing and real estate development. It is a key resource enterprise identified by the state. The investment in overseas mining resources has reached 1 billion US dollars, and it has iron, copper, gold, nickel, cobalt, lead, zinc, aluminum and other producers and mining resources. The group's total annual income in 07 was 17.58 billion US dollars, ranking 480th in the world's top 500 wealth rankings in 08. It is reported that the underwriters of H shares of MCC Group include Morgan Stanley. According to sources close to the underwriting, the listing is in operation, but in view of the recent market? Volatility, the scale of financing and the listing time have not been determined. However, in March last year, there was a media report in China that MCC planned to list in both places at the end of August 2008, with a total fundraising amount of up to 40 billion yuan. But since last September, the China Securities Regulatory Commission has begun to freeze A-share IPOs, and the listing plan of MCC has been temporarily put on hold. After the New Year of 09, the A-share index rebounded strongly, and the market widely publicized that the A-share IPO is expected to reopen, which may provide an opportunity for MCC to restart its listing plan. Market news said that MCC intended to list all its businesses as a whole except the paper industry, but the scale of financing would be greatly reduced. On the first day of its listing, Jinsheng caught up with the ""recovery tide"" of new shares. Jinsheng Group (0794), which successfully listed and raised 58 million yuan, was listed for the first time yesterday. It was not affected by Ruijin (0246), which fell sharply in two days. At the closing bell, the price was quoted at 1.2 yuan, 7.1% higher than the offering price. Without considering the handling fee, each hand can make a small profit of 160 yuan. Zhuang Jinchou, chairman of the board, expressed his satisfaction with the performance of the stock price, and said that the paper price was currently relatively stable, and it was expected to gradually improve. Jinsheng won a total of 7.5% shares of Zhang Chengfei, vice president of the main supplier Nine Dragons Paper (2689), and Li Wenjun, president of Lee & Man Paper (2314), but the two did not show up to support them until yesterday's listing ceremony. Zhang Yuanfu, the financial director of Nine Dragons Paper, and Li Wenbin, the brother of Li Wenjun, came to congratulate each other on behalf of the company.

小伙追到富家女后偷窃同学财物谈恋爱如果没出意外，冯真这会儿应该正忙着办理签证，准备出国留学的事，然而前天他却站在南京鼓楼区法院的法庭上，面对严厉的法官，背对伤心的父母，接受法律和心灵的双重审判。为了给女友留下“潇洒大方”的好印象，这个“准留学生”竟然将手伸向同学，短短数十天偷了2万余元财物。令人哭笑不得的是，被抓之后，他竟“天真”地以为，把东西还给同学就没事了。鼓楼法院依法判决他有期徒刑3年，缓刑4年，并处罚金5万余元。追到了漂亮富家女冯真是河南人，今年才刚满20岁。他打小就有出国留学的梦想，所以去年高中一毕业就来到南京某预科学校，准备先读一年，然后直接出国读本科。对于他的家庭来说，这个决定做得并不容易。冯真的父母都是搞个体经营的，手头有些积蓄，但算不上太富裕，他们心里十分清楚，一旦把儿子送出国，殷实的家境就面临着被“掏空”的危险。然而，哪个父母不望子成龙，为了孩子的未来，他们咬咬牙下定了决心——就是再苦再累也要供他读下去。2007年9月上旬，冯真在父母的陪同下来到南京某预科学校，开始了出国前的预备学习。看着父母殷切的目光，他一再保证会好好读书，争取尽快过英语关，来年申请一所好学校。开学初期，他的确很用功，几乎每天晚上都泡在图书馆里看书。然而这种平静的生活并没有维持多久。2007年底，在学校联谊活动中，他被一个名叫晓敏的女孩吸引了，她温柔可爱，衣着打扮又时髦。在这之后，冯真开始有意地接近晓敏，又是发消息嘘寒问暖，又是送鲜花表明心意，很快就打动了她，并如愿成为她的男友。风光的爱情太昂贵在这所预科学校里，家境富裕的学生比比皆是，跟其他人相比，冯真无论哪方面都不算出众。这么一个平平无奇的小子，却追到了风云人物晓敏，这让不少同学啧啧惊奇，也让冯真本人得意不已。然而风光的爱情是很昂贵的，晓敏家境很好，从小就被人捧着宠着，吃的穿的用的无一不讲究品质，谈恋爱更是追求浪漫与氛围。为了讨女友欢心，冯真表现得特别“潇洒”特别“大方”，动辄带她出入高档餐厅，一逢周末就去逛街购物，平时鲜花礼物不断。看到女友接受礼物时欢喜雀跃的模样，他觉得特满足特有面子。如此高规格的恋爱水准，生活费哪里够花，很快他就把父母开学时给的钱用光了。此后，他又以购买学习资料、报辅导班的名义要了几次，父母总是一口答应，隔日就将钱汇到他卡上。冯真花着这些钱，心里难受极了，他知道父母供他出国留学已十分勉强，根本没有多余的钱再给他挥霍。钱不够伸手偷同学恋爱不能不谈，父母那又不好开口，该怎么办呢？冯真思来想去，竟把手伸向同一栋宿舍楼的同学。2008年3月的一天，他发现某宿舍门虚掩着，里面没人，便趁机溜进去，把一位同学的IBM笔记本电脑偷了出来。得手后用书包装着电脑，到珠江路一家软件店兜售，卖得1400多元。最初他没敢花这钱，因为毕竟是偷来的，心里有点慌。然而过了好几天，谁都没怀疑到他，他这才安了心，将女友约出来潇洒了一番，很快将钱挥霍一空。有了第一次就有第二次，没过几天，他又瞄上了另一位同学的电脑，并偷了出来，到同一家软件店销赃。一次次的得手，让冯真胆子越变越大，以至于后来手头一紧，他就到各个宿舍转悠转悠寻找目标，再找个机会偷出来卖掉。直到有同学无意翻到他的柜子，才发现他盗窃的事实。原来短短数十天时间，他已偷了4台笔记本电脑、一台手机和一台游戏机，价值达到2万余元。被发现后，冯真很快被公安机关带走，对于盗窃事实，他供认不讳。当被问到为何只在宿舍偷窃时，他竟回答说：以为偷同学的东西后果不严重，被发现后还回去就没事了。“准留学生”法律知识如此匮乏令人哭笑不得。法官落槌宣判的一刹那，冯真的留学梦基本破碎了。接下来的4年，他只能待在家中，接受当地公安部门的监管。然而，让他付出昂贵代价的爱情却并不可靠，据冯真的代理律师透露，行窃的事暴露后，晓敏就消失了，直到开庭那天都没有出现。只有父母来到了法庭，为他伤心落泪。陈珊珊	冯真,晓敏,陈珊珊	负向	"After chasing the rich girl, the boy stole his classmates' money and fell in love. If there was no accident, Feng Zhen should have been busy with visa application and preparing for studying abroad. However, the day before yesterday, he stood in the court of Gulou District Court, Nanjing, facing the severe judge, facing the sad parents, and received a dual trial of law and soul. In order to leave a good impression of ""free and generous"" on his girlfriend, the ""prospective international student"" actually reached out to his classmates, and stole more than 20000 yuan of property in just a few days. Ironically, after being caught, he ""naively"" thought that it would be OK to give things back to his classmates. The Gulou Court sentenced him to 3 years' imprisonment and 4 years' probation, and fined him more than 50000 yuan. Feng Zhen, a handsome and rich girl, is from Henan Province and has just turned 20 this year. He has had the dream of studying abroad since he was young, so he came to a preparatory school in Nanjing last year just after graduating from high school, and then went abroad to study for a bachelor's degree. For his family, this decision is not easy. Feng Zhen's parents are both engaged in individual business. They have some savings, but they are not very rich. They are very clear that once their son is sent abroad, the prosperous family will face the danger of being ""emptied"". However, no parents do not hope that their children will become dragons. For the future of their children, they have made up their minds - no matter how hard or tired they are, they must supply him with food. In early September 2007, Feng Zhen, accompanied by his parents, came to a preparatory school in Nanjing for pre study before going abroad. Looking at his parents' earnest eyes, he repeatedly promised to study hard and try to pass the English test as soon as possible. In the following year, he applied for a good school. At the beginning of the semester, he really worked hard and almost every night he soaked in the library to read. However, this peaceful life did not last long. At the end of 2007, in a school friendship activity, he was attracted by a girl named Xiaomin, who was gentle, lovely and fashionable. After that, Feng Zhen began to approach Xiaomin intentionally. He sent messages to ask about the cold and warmth, and sent flowers to show his willingness. Soon, he moved her and became her boyfriend as he wished. The landscape of love is too expensive. In this preparatory school, there are many students from rich families. Compared with others, Feng Zhen is not outstanding in any aspect. Such an ordinary little boy won Xiao Min, a风云figure, which made many students sigh with surprise and made Feng Zhen himself very proud. However, the landscape of love is very expensive. Xiao Min's family is very rich. She was raised and pampered since she was a child. She is particular about the quality of what she eats, wears and uses, and she is more romantic and atmospheric when she falls in love. In order to please his girlfriend, Feng Zhen showed particularly ""easy"" and ""generous"", often taking her to high-end restaurants, going shopping on weekends, and giving flowers and gifts frequently. Seeing his girlfriend's happy and joyful look when she accepts gifts, he feels very satisfied and very happy. Such a high standard of love level, living expenses are not enough to spend, and soon he used up the money his parents gave him at the beginning of his studies. Later, he asked for several times in the name of purchasing learning materials and reporting tutoring classes, and his parents always agreed to send the money to his card the next day. Feng Zhen spent this money very hard. He knew that his parents had勉强supplied him with a lot of money to study abroad, and there was no extra money for him to squander. If you don't have enough money to steal from your classmates, you can't talk to your parents. What should you do? Feng Zhen thought about it again and again, but he reached out to his classmates in the same dormitory building. One day in March 2008, he found that the door of a dormitory was ajar and there was no one in it, so he took the opportunity to slip in and stole a classmate's IBM notebook computer. After getting the computer packed in a book bag, he went to a software store on Zhujiang Road to sell it for more than 1400 yuan. At first, he didn't dare to spend this money because it was after all stolen, and he was a little panicked. However, after several days, no one suspected him, and then he was at ease, and made an appointment with his girlfriend to have a good time, and soon ran out of money. There is a second time for the first time. In a few days, he targeted another student's computer and stole it again, and then sold it at the same software store. Again and again, Feng Zhen became more and more courageous, so that later, when his hands were tight, he would wander around various dormitories to find targets, and then find an opportunity to steal and sell them. Until a classmate accidentally turned over his cabinet, he found that he had stolen. In just a few days, he had stolen four laptops, one mobile phone and one game console, worth more than 20000 yuan. After being found out, Feng Zhen was quickly taken away by the public security organ, and he confessed to the theft. When asked why he only stole in the dormitory, he actually answered: I thought it was not serious to steal things from my classmates, and it would be OK to go back after they were found out. It is ironic that the legal knowledge of the ""prospective international student"" is so poor. At the moment when the judge fell his hammer to announce the verdict, Feng Zhen's dream of studying abroad was basically broken. In the next four years, he can only stay at home and accept the supervision of the local public security department. However, the love that made him pay a high price is unreliable. According to Feng Zhen's lawyer, Xiao Min disappeared after the theft was exposed, and she did not appear until the day of the court hearing. Only his parents came to the court and shed tears for him. Chen Shanshan"
大师傅大势分析：坚守低水勒沃不败阿森纳难出冷本期周六彩包含了四大联赛的赛事，主打还是英超和德甲。由于本周中和下周中有欧冠和联盟杯，所以周末联赛不可能不受到影响，但所受影响大小不一，未必对战局造成关键的影响。阿森纳难以出冷稳胆最看好的是阿森纳。阿森纳VS布莱克，不管阿森纳目前欧冠形势如何，都要提升联赛的名次，与维拉也仅3分的差距，阿森纳联赛不可能放弃。在上周末的足总杯赛中，阿森纳替补阵容轻取伯恩利，阿森纳完全控制战局，而且场上配合默契。小将沃尔科特缺阵四个月后复出，目前阿森纳伤病不多，完全能够应付双线作战，而且都可能排出很强的阵容应战。本场比赛的平均赔率为1.433.957.63，对比以往两队交锋的赔率，阿森纳主场胜赔相差只在0.05左右，考虑到阿森纳双赛，而且是欧冠16强淘汰赛的背景，开出此平均赔率并没有丝毫看低阿森纳的意思。而在历史对阵中，主胜相差不多的情况下，客胜赔和平局赔率都要比目前的低许多，可见平局和客胜其实已被博彩公司认为比以往更难于出现。主胜调低埃弗顿可看好埃弗顿出冷的几率要比阿森纳大得多，埃弗顿排名第六，比阿森纳少4分，比之后的西汉姆多6分，处于一个难上难下的位置，在这样的背景之下，埃弗顿本应该是不会被高看的一方，但实际上赔率所反映的并不是如此。本场比赛的平均赔率为1.493.737.05，而仅一天前才是1.503.686.88，主胜普遍调低，明由初盘的1.563.605.40调整为1.503.656.20，而Bet365虽然主胜不变，但客胜和平赔却均有调高，由初盘的1.503.607.00调整为1.504.007.50，很明显，还不到临场就已经发生不小的变化，这说明埃弗顿VS斯托克对于主队应该有重大利好，值得信任。博尔顿主场不胜博尔顿VS富勒姆，两队都是中游球队，都是无欲无求型，首先战意上就可疑，胜平负双方恐怕都不会过于在意。英超此类情况，赛果受市场影响的可能性更大。再来分析双方近况，博尔顿主场三连胜，其中包括排名高于富勒姆的西汉姆。富勒姆则是在杯赛和联赛中连续三场不胜，但客场也有逼平阿森纳这样让人不可小觑的战果。平均赔率开出2.123.203.31。亚盘目前在1.90平/半2.00左右，对应欧赔相符。在上面所述的背景之下，博尔顿主场当然会给人更有信心，市场反映上盘注码很大几率会超过下盘，主队博尔顿赢出很难。勒沃不败反弹赫塔VS勒沃，本场比赛是我极有把握的一场。先看双方背景，赫塔近期战绩较佳，近四场比赛除客场负于沃尔夫之外，其他三战全部胜出，其中包括击败拜仁。勒沃则是连续三场联赛不胜，上轮被波鸿客场逼平。由于勒沃并非没有机会拿到欧冠资格，所以远不到放弃的时候，这场比赛必然和赫塔死拼。平均赔率2.263.232.95，以双方的近况，主胜稍有偏高，在2.10-2.15范围内才相符。Bet365开出的赔率2.303.402.75，更是看低主队，而这并不是个别，超过半数的主流公司主胜都至少在2.30或以上。亚盘统一为2.08平/半1.82左右，客队低水已摆明了态度，从初盘开出至今水位几乎没有调整，预计到临场也不可能会有大变，客队一定是坚持低水，保持不败的可能性极高。上周再负的瓦伦西，本轮坐镇主场，主胜开出1.70的赔率，明显偏高，不能排除连续出冷的可能性，彩民做胆需谨慎。		正向	Master Fu Datu analysis: adhere to the low water Leverkusen unbeaten Arsenal hard to get out of the cold. This Saturday's lottery includes the events of the four major leagues, focusing on the Premier League and the Bundesliga. Since there are the Champions League and the League Cup in the middle of this week and next week, the weekend league is bound to be affected, but the degree of impact varies, and it is not necessarily crucial to the battle situation. Arsenal is the most stable and daring to win the cold. Arsenal VS Blackburn. No matter what the current Champions League situation of Arsenal is, it must improve the ranking of the league. There is only 3 points gap with Villa, and the league of Arsenal is impossible to give up. In last weekend's FA Cup match, Arsenal's substitute team easily defeated Burnley, Arsenal completely controlled the battle, and the team cooperated well. After four months of absence from Walcott, Arsenal has few injuries at present, and it is fully capable of dealing with the dual line war, and it is possible to play a strong team. The average odds of this game are 1.433.957.63. Compared with the odds of the two teams in the past, the home win of Arsenal is only about 0.05. Considering the fact that Arsenal has a double match and the background of the Champions League round of 16 elimination, there is no intention to look down on Arsenal in this average odds. In the historical confrontation, under the condition that the main win is not much different, the guest win and the draw probability are much lower than the current level, which shows that the betting companies have actually considered the draw and the guest win as more difficult to appear than before. The main win is adjusted to Everton. The chance of Everton to win the cold is much greater than Arsenal. Everton ranks sixth, 4 points less than Arsenal, 6 points more than West Ham, and is in a difficult position to go up or down. Under such a background, Everton should not be the one who is highly regarded, but in fact, the odds reflected is not so. The average odds of this game are 1.493.737.05, and only one day ago, they were 1.503.686.88. The main victory was generally adjusted. The main victory of 1.563.605.40 was adjusted to 1.503.656.20 at the beginning of the game, while Bet365, although the main victory remains unchanged, the guest victory and the peace victory have been increased. The main victory of 1.503.607.00 at the beginning of the game was adjusted to 1.504.007.50. Obviously, there has been a significant change even before the game, which shows that Everton VS Stoke should have significant benefits for the home team, and it is worth trusting. Bolton's home invincibility Bolton VS Fulham. Both teams are mid-level teams and have no desire. First of all, the war is questionable, and both sides may not care too much about victory, peace and defeat. In this case of the Premier League, the results of the game are more likely to be affected by the market. Next, let's analyze the recent situation of both sides. Bolton has won three consecutive home games, including West Ham, which is ranked higher than Fulham. Fulham, on the other hand, has lost three consecutive games in the cup and league, but it also has the result of equalizing Arsenal away from home, which is not to be underestimated. The average probability is 2.123.203.31. The Asian plate is currently around 1.90 Pingban 2.00, which is in line with the European compensation. In the context mentioned above, Bolton's home court will naturally give people more confidence. The market reflects that the upper disk code is very likely to exceed the lower disk, and it is very difficult for the home team Bolton to win. Leverkusen's unbeaten rebound Herta VS Leverkusen is a game I am very confident of. First, look at the background of both sides. Herta has a better recent performance. In the past four games, except for the loss to Wolfsburg away from home, all the other three games have been won, including defeating Bayern. Leverkusen has lost three consecutive league games, and last round was forced to draw away by Bochum. Since Leverkusen is far from giving up the opportunity to qualify for the Champions League, it is by no means the time to give up. This game must fight with Herta to the death. The average probability is 2.263.232.95. In view of the recent situation of both sides, the main victory is slightly high, and it is in line with the range of 2.10-2.15. Bet365's odds of 2.303.402.75 are lower than the main team, and this is not unique. More than half of the mainstream companies' main victories are at least 2.30 or more. The Asian plate is unified as 2.08 Pingban 1.82. The low water level of the guest team has made it clear that the water level has hardly been adjusted since the opening of the primary plate. It is expected that there will not be any big changes at the scene. The guest team must stick to the low water level, and the possibility of keeping unbeaten is extremely high. Valencia, who lost again last week, is in charge of the home court in this round. The main victory is 1.70, which is obviously too high, and it is impossible to rule out the possibility of continuous cold. Caution is needed for the lottery to be brave.

RJ调升BedBath&Beyond股票评级新浪财经讯北京时间周六凌晨，一位华尔街分析师宣布，调升家庭用品连锁店BedBath&BeyondInc.的股票评级，理由是股价已遭受严重打压，随着竞争对手清盘销售的结束，这只股票很有可能上涨。RaymondJames的分析师布德-巴格奇(BuddBugatch)向投资者指出，他已将这家总部位于新泽西州Union的零售商的股票评级从“与大盘持平”调升至“优于大盘”。巴格奇在一份研究报告中写道：“我们论断的主要依据是这只股票已被严重低估，以及Linens'nThings停业清盘销售活动临近结束。随着投资者开始寻找高品质的股票，BedBath&Beyond有望成为首批复苏的股票之一。”今年九月以来BedBath&Beyond的股票已下跌约30%，随着Linens'NThings停业清盘，该股遭受了更大卖压。10月17日，Linens'NThings店面的商品开始低价抛售。巴格奇还称：“鉴于Linens'NThings的清盘销售即将结束，我们估计投资者将迎来一个更合理的定价环境。”这位分析师指出，虽然处在经济低迷期，但是BedBath&Beyond的销售和运营盈利率令人羡慕，“管理层的推销和成本控制能力是我们所知的企业中最好的，虽然他们偶尔与投资者沟通不足应予以批评。”巴格奇调升BedBath&Beyond的评级前，本周二该公司宣布，调降对第三财季每股盈利的预期，新预期范围为31至35美分，原预期为41至47美分。新财测明显低于华尔街人士目前普遍预期的每股盈利40美分。BedBath&Beyond指出，第三季的同店销售--即开张至少一年店面的销售额--可能同比下滑5.6%。截至周五美东时间下午2:15(北京时间周六凌晨3点15分)，在纽约证交所上市的BedBath&Beyond股票上涨77美分，至23.63美元，涨幅为3.4%。	巴格奇,布德-巴格奇	正向	"RJ upgrades BedBath & Beyond Stock Rating Sina Finance News reported on Saturday morning, Beijing time. A Wall Street analyst announced that he would upgrade the stock rating of BedBath & Beyond Inc., a home goods chain store, because the stock price has been seriously frustrated, and it is likely to rise with the end of competitors' liquidation and sales. Budd Bugatch, an analyst at RaymondJames, pointed out to investors that he had upgraded the stock rating of the retailer headquartered in Union, New Jersey from ""in line with the market"" to ""better than the market"". Bugatch wrote in a research report: ""The main basis of our argument is that this stock has been seriously undervalued, and Linens'nThings' closing and liquidation sales activities are coming to an end. As investors begin to look for high-quality stocks, BedBath & Beyond is expected to be one of the first stocks to recover."" Since September this year, BedBath & Beyond's shares have fallen by about 30%, and the shares have suffered greater selling pressure with the closure and liquidation of Linens'NThings. On October 17, the goods in the stores of Linens'NThings began to be sold at a low price. Bugatch also said: ""In view of the fact that the liquidation and sales of Linens'NThings is coming to an end, we estimate that investors will welcome a more reasonable pricing environment."" The analyst pointed out that although BedBath & Beyond is in an economic downturn, its sales and operational profit margin are enviable, ""The management's promotion and cost control capabilities are the best we know, although they should be criticized for occasionally failing to communicate with investors."" Before Bugatch upgraded BedBath & Beyond's rating, the company announced on Tuesday that it would reduce its forecast of earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter. The new forecast range was 31 to 35 cents, compared with 41 to 47 cents. The new financial forecast is significantly lower than the current average expectation of 40 cents per share on Wall Street. BedBath & Beyond pointed out that the same store sales in the third quarter - that is, the sales of stores that have been open for at least one year - may decline by 5.6% year on year. As of 2:15 p.m. Eastern Time on Friday (3:15 a.m. on Saturday, Beijing time), BedBath & Beyond's shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose 77 cents to $23.63, an increase of 3.4%."

考研政治辅导：细说邓三概论复习要点在考研政治考查的6门课程中，邓小平理论和三个代表重要思想概论处于承上启下的中心地位，直接或间接体现邓小平理论和三个代表重要思想概论的考分要占50%以上，2008年的考试大纲变化也主要体现在这部分。因此，单就考试范围而言，重点课程当然是邓小平理论和三个代表重要思想概论。这部分内容有两个突出的特点：一是它有很强的实践性，各个章节和相应的各知识点，涉及到我国社会主义现代化建设的各个主要方面，要求考生以邓小平理论为指南，分析说明我国实现社会经济政治生活中的一系列重大问题、热点现象某认识和把握改革开放以来我国在经济基础和上层建筑所出现的许多重大变革和发展；二是它有很强的政策性，对本部分个章节和相应知识点的理解和把握，几乎都涉及现阶段我们党和政府的重大方针政策，对这些重大方针政策的理解和把握，是考生学好这部分内容并在应考时候能够做到理论联系实际的关键。从上述特点出发，考生在学习“邓小平理论”这部分的内容时，应着重注意把握以下几个环节：(1)通过复习熟记邓小平理论的基本内容，把基本常识、基本概念搞清楚，即可应对该部分的选择题。因为此部分的选择题多比较直观，从总体上说不是很难，只要复习全面就能做到判断标准。(2)要特别注重理论联系实际。考生应结合考试大纲中的有关知识点，了解和把握我国改革开放以来出现的一系列重大问题、热点现象，以及我们在改革、开放和发展等方面所做出的一系列重要举措。因为对这部分内容的考查，在政治考研试卷中往往更多地采取分析论述题、分析材料提灯主观性试题的形式，而题目给出的材料往往都是我们现实社会经济政治生活的现象和问题。所以，考生在复习备考过程中，就应当结合个章节内容关注现实生活，了解现实生活中的那些重大问题、热点现象产生的原因、背景，以及矛盾的焦点所在，并有意识地培养训练自己用正确理论观点分析说明这些现象和问题的能力。(3)要结合各章节内容的学习，注意了解和把握与之有关的中央文件的精神，认真学习以胡锦涛为总书记的党中央提出的以科学发展为统领和主题的关于发展的一系列战略思想。如中共十六届五中全会关于“十一五”规划建议中的一些新观点、新思想、新论断等，这些战略思想极可能成为命题方向、中心和重点。(4)要注意学科之间的交叉和融会贯通。《邓论》所阐述的多是我们现实经济、政治和社会生活中的重大问题、热点问题，对这些问题往往既可以用《邓论》中的观点和原理来分析，也可以用《政经》、《哲学》等学科的观点和原理来分析。因此，考生在复习《邓论》的有关内容时，应特别注意学科之间的融会贯通，即在平时就有针对性地尝试用《政经》、《哲学》中的原理，来分析《邓论》中涉及的重大现实、热点问题。唯有如此，才能更好地应对政治考研试卷中那些要求综合运用多学科知识来回答的主观性试题。	邓小平,胡锦涛	正向	"Postgraduate political tutoring: In the six courses examined in postgraduate politics, Deng Xiaoping's theory and the overview of the Three Represents play a central role in connecting the past and the future, directly or indirectly reflecting the examination score of Deng Xiaoping's theory and the overview of the Three Represents should account for more than 50%, and the change of the 2008 examination outline mainly reflects this part. Therefore, in terms of examination scope, the key course is, of course, Deng Xiaoping's Theory and the Overview of the Three Represents. This part has two outstanding characteristics: firstly, it has strong practicality. Each chapter and the corresponding knowledge points involve all the main aspects of China's socialist modernization. Candidates are required to take Deng Xiaoping's Theory as a guide to analyze and explain a series of major problems, hot phenomena, and understand and grasp the many major changes and developments that have taken place in China since the reform and opening up in terms of economic foundation and superstructure; Secondly, it has strong policy. The understanding and grasp of the chapters and corresponding knowledge points of this part almost involves the major guidelines and policies of our party and government at this stage. The understanding and grasp of these major guidelines and policies is the key for candidates to learn this part well and be able to combine theory with practice when taking exams. In view of the above characteristics, when candidates study the ""Deng Xiaoping Theory"" part, they should pay attention to the following links: (1) Through review, remember the basic content of Deng Xiaoping Theory, clarify the basic common sense and basic concepts, and then answer the choice questions of this part. Because the choice questions in this part are mostly intuitive, in general, they are not very difficult. As long as you review comprehensively, you can make judgment standards. (2) Pay special attention to the combination of theory with practice. Candidates should, in combination with the relevant knowledge points in the examination outline, understand and grasp a series of major problems and hot phenomena that have emerged in China since the reform and opening up, as well as a series of major measures we have taken in the aspects of reform, opening up and development. Because the examination of this part of the content often adopts the form of analytical and argumentative questions and analytical material lamp subjective questions in the political postgraduate examination paper, the materials given by the questions are often the phenomena and problems of our real social economy and political life. Therefore, in the process of reviewing and preparing for the examination, candidates should pay attention to real life in combination with the content of each chapter, understand the causes, background and focus of those major problems and hot phenomena in real life, and consciously train their ability to analyze and explain these phenomena and problems with correct theoretical views. (3) In combination with the learning of the contents of each chapter, pay attention to understanding and grasping the spirit of the central documents related to it, and carefully study the series of strategic ideas on development put forward by the Central Committee of the CPC with Hu Jintao as the general secretary, with scientific development as the leader and theme. Such as some new views, new ideas and new conclusions in the Suggestions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Eleventh Five Year Plan, these strategic ideas are likely to become the direction, center and focus of the topic. (4) Pay attention to the intersection and integration between disciplines. The many major problems and hotspot issues discussed in ""Dun Lun"" are often our major problems and hotspot issues in real economy, politics and social life. These problems can often be analyzed in terms of the views and principles in ""Dun Lun"", as well as the views and principles in ""Political Economy"" and ""Philosophy"". Therefore, when reviewing the relevant content of ""Dun Lun"", candidates should pay special attention to the integration of disciplines, that is, they should try to use the principles in ""Political Economy"" and ""Philosophy"" to analyze the major realities and hotspot issues involved in ""Dun Lun"" in a targeted way in their daily study. Only in this way can we better deal with the subjective questions in the political postgraduate examination paper that require the comprehensive application of multi-disciplinary knowledge to answer."

世锦赛之最：菲尔普斯被谁抢风头泳坛朗哥最悲壮新浪体育讯　本届大赛在破纪录大放卫星的“盛景”下落幕，可说的话题绝不会少，在这里选出部分有些趣味的“某某之最”评选，以飨读者。最大的赢家虽然在200自上输给了德国人比德尔曼，但菲尔普斯并没有因此变成“地球人”，五块金牌依然奠定他游坛第一人的崇高地位。他在200蝶上的巨大优势是他人难以企及的，而100蝶上勇胜卡维奇更是经典一幕，让他在北京奥运会该项上落下的争议就此划上句号，这次的胜负可是肉眼都能看得出。而三个集体项目，菲尔普斯也贡献了自己的力量，尤其在今年大赛最后一项4乘100混合泳上，他在最拿手的100蝶上，帮助美国队彻底拉开了和其他对手的距离。最大的看点这次无可非议被泳衣抢去了最大风头，韩老师说得好，穿上这衣服，人人都可以当鱼雷，谁不破纪录拿冠军真是羞耻的事，高科技衣服让国际泳联做出了来年1月1日就必须废止的决定。另外这衣服还特别容易破，男选手豁得出去，光着腚也要毫不犹豫跳下去，还能让相机抓拍到自己弧度漂亮的“散热沟”，女选手那可就惨多了。差距最小的决赛如果要评最激烈的争夺，那选择可多了去，但要选差距最小的决赛成绩，只有男子200米蛙泳，匈牙利选手格尤尔塔不声不响，在最后50米时发起冲刺，赶上了此前大幅度领先的尚蒂，最后格尤尔塔以百分之一秒的优势胜出，让尚蒂这个“泳坛阿壮”徒呼奈何！最黑的黑马本届比赛虽然意外的冠军不少，但要说意外中的意外，非德国人比德尔曼莫属，一个在北京奥运会还是200自第5，400自第17的只能说是实力派的选手，竟然在本届大赛上连续打破两项世界纪录，尤其是200自不仅战胜了菲尔普斯，更是把“菲鱼”保持的世界纪录提高了近一秒！现在人们终于相信：北京奥运会后他在短池上曾经创造了200自世界纪录，敢情就是为了今日破长池纪录提前热身一把的！至于他如何能在一年内提高成绩如此之快，肯定他训练刻苦外，高科技衣服的帮助也已经成为公认事实。最年轻的和最老的游泳这行当，80后哪怕是89年12月31日出生的，也绝对不是新人，70后真可以退休当教练了，60后还有的话，只能感慨世界真奇妙，但偏偏还是有60后的人参加，她就是让人肃然起敬的妈妈级选手、67年4月15日出生的美国自由泳选手塔拉-托雷斯，她在最后一日结束的女子50自决赛中获得第八，42岁的选手在一批20岁最后的后生小子竞争的舞台上获得第八，艰辛程度可想而知。那么最年轻的是谁？是97年2月4日出生的戈里-科特查，她来自坦桑尼亚，参加100米自由泳比赛，两人差距远达30岁！破得最疯狂的世界纪录本届大赛选手们43次打破31项世界纪录，赛会纪录更是不值一提，从预赛开始这个赛会纪录就象陶器一样脆弱，在其中最容易破的纪录只能属于男子800米自由泳，张琳把原纪录竟然提高了6秒53！佩金斯94年创造7分46秒00的纪录，随后经过索普两次破纪录，再到05年哈克特以7分38秒65创造新纪录时，11年的时间800米时间才缩短了7秒多，而张琳这次用了4年之间，就让人类随时要在800米项目上进入7分30秒大关了！最痛苦的颁奖男子50米蛙泳决赛，巴西选手费利佩获得亚军，看看其他项目的颁奖台上，欧美选手，也包括中日选手，能拿到奖牌已经不错了，所以大伙都很高兴，惟独费利佩是个大例外，他表情异常痛苦地接过银牌，而后手捧着鲜花时竟然跪倒在地，号啕大哭起来，让颁奖官员和旁边的人都不知所措，其实也好理解，费利佩是该项世界纪录创造者，他脑海里想的，真的只是金牌。最“和谐”的一幕在女子1500米自由泳比赛中，意大利选手费利皮获得冠军，当然是要奏国歌升国旗，这届比赛又是在意大利罗马进行，可以想象此时的热血沸腾的情形。但估计播放唱片的机器出了问题，正当意大利人唱得正来劲时，国歌突然没声了，大伙好象在玩快闪似的，一时间仿佛被定格不动了，随后的场景让人感慨：不用重放国歌，所有的意大利人，嘴角上翘，相视一笑，这段插曲就这么过去了。(孟巍)	塔拉-托雷斯,张琳,哈克特,韩老师,费利佩,戈里-科特查,朗哥,菲尔普斯,卡维奇,索普,格尤尔塔,尚蒂,比德尔曼,孟巍,费利皮,佩金斯	正向	"The most world championships: Phelps was outwitted by Lang Ge, the most tragic Sina Sports News The closing of this competition under the ""prosperous"" scene of breaking records and launching satellites can never be short of topics. Here, we have selected some interesting ""most"" selections to enjoy the readers. Although the biggest winner lost to the German Biederman in the 200 self, Phelps did not become an ""earthling"" as a result, and five gold medals still established his lofty status as the first person in the swimming world. His huge advantage in the 200 butterfly is beyond the reach of others, and his victory in the 100 butterfly on Caviar is a classic scene, which draws a sentence to the controversy he fell behind in this event in the Beijing Olympic Games. This victory can be seen with the naked eye. In the three collective events, Phelps also contributed his own strength. In particular, in the last 4x100 medley of this year's competition, he helped the American team completely open the distance with other opponents in the most skilled 100 butterfly. The most attractive thing this time was无可非议that the swimming suit took the most advantage of the limelight. As Teacher Han said well, everyone can be a torpedo when they wear this clothes. It is really a shame that no one can break the record and win the championship. The high-tech clothes made the International Swimming Federation make the decision that must be abolished on January 1 next year. In addition, the clothes are particularly easy to break. Male athletes can afford to jump down naked, and they can also let the camera snap their beautiful ""heat dissipation ditch"" arc. Female athletes are much worse. If the final with the smallest gap is to be evaluated as the most intense competition, there are many choices. But if you want to choose the final result with the smallest gap, there is only the men's 200 meter breaststroke. Geyourta, a Hungarian swimmer, made a silent sprint in the last 50 meters and caught up with Shanti, who had been far ahead. In the end, Geyourta won by one hundredth of a second, leaving Shanti, the ""strong swimmer"", helpless! The biggest dark horse Although there were many unexpected champions in this competition, the biggest one was that the Germans, Biederman, had to be the biggest surprise. He was a powerful player who was only the fifth in the 200 self and the 17th in the 400 self in the Beijing Olympic Games. He actually broke two world records in this competition, especially in the 200 self, not only defeating Phelps, but also improving the world record kept by ""Fifi"" by nearly one second! Now people finally believe that after the Beijing Olympic Games, he once created a world record in the 200m self on the short track. In order to break the long pool record today, he warmed up in advance! As for how he can improve his results so quickly within a year, it is definitely hard to train him. In addition, the help of high-tech clothes has also become an accepted fact. The youngest and the oldest swimming industry is absolutely not a newcomer, even if it was born on December 31, 1989. People in the 1970s can really retire as a coach. If there are still people in the 1960s, they can only sigh that the world is really wonderful. But there are still people in the 1960s who participate in the competition. She is Tara Torres, an American freestyle swimmer who was born on April 15, 1967. She won the eighth place in the women's 50 self final on the last day. It is conceivable that the hardship of a 42 year old player in a competition of young people at the age of 20. So who is the youngest? It's Gory Ketcha, who was born on February 4, 1997. She is from Tanzania and participated in the 100m freestyle competition. The gap between the two is as long as 30 years! The most crazy world record of this competition broke 31 world records 43 times. The competition record is not worth mentioning. From the beginning of the preliminary competition, the competition record was as fragile as pottery. The easiest record to break in it can only belong to the men's 800 meter freestyle. Zhang Lin surprisingly improved the original record by 6.53 seconds! Perkins created a record of 7 minutes and 46 seconds in 94 years. Later, after Thor broke the record twice, when Hackett created a new record of 7 minutes and 38 seconds in 05 years, it was only 7 seconds more than 800 meters in 11 years. Zhang Lin used 4 years to let humans enter the 7 minute and 30 second pass in the 800 meter event at any time! The most painful award The men's 50 meter breaststroke final was a Brazilian player, Felipe, who won the second place. Looking at the awards platform of other projects, European and American players, including Chinese and Japanese players, have won medals, so everyone is very happy. Felipe is the only big exception. He painfully receives the silver medal, and then kneels down and wails when he holds the flowers in his hand, which makes the award officials and the people beside him at a loss. In fact, it is also understandable. Felipe is the world record creator of this event. What he thinks in his mind is really just the gold medal. The most ""harmonious"" scene In the women's 1500m freestyle competition, the Italian player Felipe won the championship. Of course, the national anthem was played and the national flag was raised. This competition was held in Rome, Italy, so it is imaginable that at this moment, the situation of blood boiling. But it is estimated that the record player broke down. When the Italians were coming to the climax of singing, the national anthem suddenly lost its voice. Everyone seemed to be playing a fast flash, as if they were frozen. The scene later makes people sigh: There is no need to replay the national anthem. All Italians, with their corners of their mouths turned up and smiling at each other, have passed this episode.

男子办驾照途中遇车祸身亡(图)上午还接到弟弟的电话下午兄弟俩阴阳永隔没有证人，肇事司机不承认责任哥哥发帖求助：目击者，你在哪里？记者张玉东核实：A弟弟正在市二院做尸检记者根据帖子上留下的电话联系上了发帖人，他叫王申东，是死者的亲哥哥。他说，现在全家人都在第二人民医院，等待弟弟的尸检消息。下午5点，我们见到了王申东，眼睛红肿的他把我们领到医院一个草坪处。此时，全家老幼十几个人正坐在草坪上抱头痛哭。死者3岁的女儿正在妈妈的怀抱中不住眨着眼睛，她还没有意识到就此永远失去父爱。“我刚生了个儿子，上午弟弟还给我打电话道喜，没想到下午就……”王申东回忆说，11月9日下午2点多，他突然接到弟弟同事葛闯的电话，说杰春在办理驾照的途中被一辆垃圾车给撞了，不行了。怕弟妹想不开，一夜不眠“我都不敢想我是怎么把不幸的消息一个一个告诉家人的，每通电话心里都会被针刀扎一样。”王申东说，父母都在老家，母亲又有偏瘫，他一直犹豫要不要告诉二老，可是想着要让父母见上弟弟最后一面，他还是忍痛告诉了南阳唐河的二老，他们下午才赶来的，母亲已经哭昏三回。“9号那天，弟妹知道消息后，当时就昏倒了。”王申东说，怕出事，他和妻子就把弟妹和他3岁多的大女儿王芳接到了家中。“小杰、小杰……”王申东说，当晚他和妻子一夜不敢入睡，因为弟妹抱着王芳一直呼喊弟弟的名字，怕弟妹会做傻事，他和妻子在旁一直安慰到天亮。肇事司机不承认，亲戚苦寻目击者“刚刚医生说弟弟左侧肋骨断裂，如果单纯从电动车上摔下来，能摔这么重吗？”王申东说，肇事司机和垃圾车现已被警方带走处理。“司机姓魏，说他的车根本没有撞痕，事故跟他一点关系都没有。”王申东后来到现场去看了，当时垃圾车后有两米长的刹车印，“车速肯定特别快”。王申东说，当时弟弟跟同事三个人骑了三辆电动车，没有并行而是一字排开，弟弟排在最后，事发时，前面两个人听到身后“砰”的一声，弟弟已躺在了地上，没有目睹到底是撞了还是没撞，所以不能证明事故。昨天下午5点30分，我们来到了郑平路车管所向北100米处，这就是死者王杰春出事的地点。周围开的有饭店和洗车房，但王申东口中的两米长刹车痕已经找不到了。“你看又有一辆垃圾车开过来了，多快！”王申东有些愤怒地喊道。随后，我们走访了周围商铺。“我那时正在屋里吃饭，听到响声就跑了出来，看到一个光头正在给躺在地上的人掐人中，光头应该是司机。”附近居民王先生说，当时垃圾车拐到了路西侧斜着停靠，中心线附近倒着电动车和一个男子。“撞没撞我真的不敢瞎说，我毕竟没有亲眼见。”王先生和几位邻居纷纷说道。留下两个女儿，小的刚两岁“我弟弟比我有本事，全家人都靠着他。”王申东说，弟弟开了一家货运公司，已经干了七年，生意特别好，每天至少能挣500元以上。“现在没有弟弟，货运公司已经关门了，哎！好日子还没过多久，他的两个孩子以后可咋办啊。”王申东说，弟弟的两个女儿一个3岁多，一个刚2岁。随后，记者与警方取得了联系，民警说，该事故正在调查之中。“我希望那些看见事故的人，能给我打电话，帮帮我们家人，我们会永远记得的。”王申东哭了。	王申东,张玉东,葛闯	负向	"A man died in a traffic accident on his way to get his driver's license (picture) In the morning, he received a phone call from his brother, and in the afternoon, the brothers were separated forever. There were no witnesses, and the driver who caused the accident did not admit his responsibility. Brother posted a message to help: Witness, where are you? Zhang Yudong, a journalist, verified that the younger brother was having an autopsy at the Second Hospital. The journalist contacted the poster according to the telephone number left on the post. His name was Wang Shen Dong, the elder brother of the deceased. He said that now the whole family were at the Second People's Hospital, waiting for the news of his brother's autopsy. At 5:00 p.m., we met Wang Shen Dong, who led us to a lawn in the hospital with red and swollen eyes. At this time, more than a dozen people in the family were sitting on the grass crying with their heads in their arms. The three-year-old daughter of the deceased was blinking her eyes in her mother's arms, and she had not realized that she had lost her father's love forever. ""I just had a son. This morning, my brother called to congratulate me. I didn't expect it to be in the afternoon..."" Wang Shen Dong recalled that at more than 2:00 p.m. on the afternoon of November 9, he suddenly received a call from his brother's colleague Ge Chuang, saying that Jie Chun was hit by a garbage truck on his way to get his driver's license, and it was no good.

网上谣传“杀人信息”俩人被拘新华社电忽而在网上“预言”有杀手将在某日再度杀人，忽而言之凿凿宣称警匪枪战后“杀人狂”落网，这些“刀光剑影”的网络信息近来把很多长沙人闹得惴惴不安。长沙市公安局2日宣布，警方已从源头查获捏造“杀人信息”的一男一女，对他们分别处以行政拘留10日的处罚。“杀人犯向公安局挑战”近一年多来，长沙市南郊公园、芙蓉南路和东二环附近先后发生了枪击杀人案，犯罪分子杀人后均逃之夭夭。对此，长沙社会各界议论纷纷。11月25日前后，互联网上一些长沙本地论坛、QQ群中出现了题为“南郊公园杀人犯28号会出来杀人”的帖文。该帖文称“南郊公园杀人犯向公安局挑战，28号会出来杀人……我们银行从今天开始已经有3个便衣了。”还“提醒”市民28号不要随便出门，也不要去银行。帖文以疯狂速度传播，一些长沙市民为之胆寒。11月29日16时许，网上又开始传播声称来源于“湖南省公安厅和长沙市公安局”的消息：在长沙制造枪击案的犯罪嫌疑人落网，被捕前曾与警方发生激烈枪战，还称一民警在枪战中牺牲。消息源于公交车上听说对这些“刀光剑影”的网络消息，长沙警方澄清指均属捏造。据警方通报，经调查，“预言”杀手再度杀人的为一名证券公司员工袁某(女，22岁)；而宣称警匪枪战后“杀人狂”落网的人，则是某彩色印刷公司员工刘某某(男，23岁)。面对警方讯问，袁某称消息源于“公交车上听说”，刘某某则明确承认消息为自己亲手炮制。袁、刘二人传播消息都通过各自熟悉的QQ群，继而被其他QQ群、论坛、网站以讹传讹，最终引发社会震动。对袁、刘二人，长沙警方决定依照《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚法》相关规定作出行政拘留10日的处罚决定。长沙市公安局强调，南郊公园枪击案等数起恶性案件发生后，公安机关一直在全力以赴地侦查案件和追捕犯罪嫌疑人，争取尽早将其抓捕归案。一旦嫌疑人落网，将在第一时间通过主流新闻媒体向社会披露。长沙警方强调，枪击杀人案社会关注度高，市民群众以多种方式关注可以理解，但如果制造、散布谣言造成社会恐慌、扰乱正常社会秩序就属于触犯法律，警方将依法追究虚假信息制造者的法律责任。	刘某某,袁某	负向	"The online rumor of ""murder information"" was detained by Xinhua News Agency. Suddenly, it was ""predicted"" online that a killer would kill again on a certain day, and it was declared that the ""killing maniac"" was caught after the police gang fight. These ""sword and sword"" network information has recently made many people in Changsha nervous. The Changsha Public Security Bureau announced on the 2nd that the police had arrested a man and a woman who fabricated ""murder information"" from the source, and they were given 10 days' administrative detention respectively. ""The murderer challenges the public security bureau"" For nearly more than a year, shooting and killing cases have successively occurred in the South Suburban Park, Furong South Road and Dong Erhuan in Changsha. After the criminals committed murder, they all escaped. In this regard, the whole society in Changsha has had a lot of discussions. Around November 25, some local forums and QQ groups in Changsha on the Internet appeared a post titled ""The murderer in South Suburban Park will come out to kill on the 28th"". The post said, ""The murderer in South Suburban Park challenged the Public Security Bureau. He will come out to kill on the 28th... Our bank has had three plainclothes people since today."" Also ""remind"" citizens not to go out or go to the bank on the 28th. The post spread at a crazy speed, and some citizens in Changsha were terrified. At about 16:00 on November 29, the Internet began to spread a message claiming that it came from the ""Department of Public Security of Hunan Province and the Public Security Bureau of Changsha City"": The criminal suspect who committed the shooting case in Changsha was arrested, and he had an intense gun battle with the police before his arrest, and it was said that a police officer sacrificed in the gun battle. The message originated from the bus. In view of these ""sword and sword"" network messages, the Changsha police clarified that they were all fabricated. According to the police bulletin, after investigation, Yuan, a 22 year old female employee of a securities company, ""prophesied"" that the killer would kill again; Liu, a 23 year old male employee of a color printing company, claimed that the ""mad killer"" was caught after the police gang fight. Faced with police questioning, Yuan said that the news came from ""hearing on the bus"", while Liu made it clear that the news was prepared by himself. Fuan and Liu spread messages through their familiar QQ groups, and then they were spread by other QQ groups, forums and websites, which eventually triggered social shocks. For Yuan and Liu, the Changsha Public Security Bureau decided to give them 10 days' administrative detention in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Public Security Administration Punishment Law of the People's Republic of China. The Changsha Public Security Bureau stressed that after several恶性cases, such as the South Suburban Park shooting case, the public security organ has been fully committed to investigating cases and pursuing criminal suspects, and strive to catch them as soon as possible. Once the suspect is caught, the public will be disclosed to the public through the main news media at the first time. The Changsha police stressed that the shooting and killing cases had high social attention. It was understandable that the citizens paid attention in many ways, but if they created and spread rumors, causing social panic and disrupting the normal social order, they would be in violation of the law, and the police would investigate the legal responsibility of the false information maker."
国安最受诟病处有盏不老神灯他配得上称御林军队魂新浪体育讯　清新湿润的气候，山呼海啸的助威，一掷千金的奖励，豪华奢侈的阵容。一切有利条件没能为恒大带来一场预期的胜利。而面对恒大狂风暴雨般的进攻，上一轮饱受诟病的国安防线却在这个夜晚显得格外坚挺。其中，作为后防中坚的队长徐云龙居功至伟。在赛前接受采访时，徐云龙就表示“希望用我们的整体来逼抢与限制对手”。果然，全场比赛徐云龙与血性拼搏对方前锋穆里奇针锋相对。第32分钟，穆里奇禁区内得球大力抽射，徐云龙飞身阻挡却没能阻止恒大打入扳平比分的入球。然而这次失球却彻底点燃了国安队长的激情。第35分钟，徐云龙大脚长传前场，恒大解围后打出快速反击，徐云龙为了阻止对方进攻在中线附近对穆里奇犯规吃到黄牌。尽管这次判罚争议不大，徐云龙却利用自己经验向裁判表达不满。2分钟后，国安小将朴成同样因为对穆里奇的犯规得到黄牌，为年轻队友鸣不平的徐云龙险些与穆里奇相互示威险些引起冲突。第39分钟，穆里奇面对出击已经拿到球的杨智做出了附加动作，就在国安队友纷纷上前质问穆里奇的时候，徐云龙发挥了队长的作用劝慰队友并示意裁判对方犯规存在恶意，使穆里奇得到应得黄牌的同时也使比赛重新回到正常轨道。如果说上半场徐云龙的表现可以用激情四射来形容，那么下半场的徐云龙则可谓血性十足了。无论是中路稳健的头球解围与卡位抢断，还是两个边路及时的补位防守，都体现了这位老将的良好状态以及丰富的经验。尤其是比赛第80分钟，穆里奇在国安禁区内挑球过人，险些形成单刀之势，多亏徐云龙飞身倒钩解围才化解了此次险情，自己却也因为这次解围左脚受伤。而接下来发生的一幕则让国安队长出离愤怒了。在队医查看伤情的同时，抬担架的工作人员却用担架撞击了徐云龙的头部示意他赶快上担架。这一无礼举动让久经沙场的国安队长惊讶也怒不可遏，忍痛单腿跳起怒斥担架队员。而恒大前锋克莱奥却依然上前示意徐云龙诈伤拖延比赛时间。最终徐云龙还是在队医的搀扶下一瘸一拐走出场地接受了治疗。（点击观看视频）尽管被穆里奇超强的个人能力制造了不小的麻烦，难以掩盖的是徐云龙这样一位老队长在比赛中表现出的统帅能力、拼搏精神以及丰富的关键时刻丰富的比赛经验。早在赛季前的准备期，徐云龙就通过努力的训练将自己的身体状态特别是体重调整到了近年来最佳值。联想起联赛首轮对阵江苏时奋不顾身的回追封堵了对方的单刀球，我们可以看到，尽管年逾30，徐云龙在国安队的领袖地位却依然是不可动摇的，特别是在今年没有内外援补充的后卫线，徐云龙的存在就显得格外珍贵了。在为这位老将喝彩的同时，我们也不得不看到隐忧：徐云龙这样的状态还能维持几年？当老队长力不从心之时国安防线又有谁可以依赖？期待着年轻队员的尽快成长以及高水平内外援的补充，使这位国安功臣有朝一日可以放心的淡出。(非予)	朴成,非予,徐云龙,穆里奇,克莱奥,杨智	正向	"The most criticized thing about the national security is that he deserves to be called the soul of the royal forest army. Sina Sports News Fresh and humid climate, mountain calls and sea啸es, a thousand gold rewards, and luxurious and luxurious lineup. All favorable conditions failed to bring a expected victory to Hengda. In the face of Hengda's stormy attack, the most criticized national defense line of the last round was particularly tough on this night. Among them, the captain Xu Yulong, as the backbone of the rear defense, is the most important contributor. In an interview before the game, Xu Yulong said ""I hope to use our whole team to force and restrict the opponent"". Sure enough, Xu Yulong and the other forward Murich fought against each other throughout the game. In the 32nd minute, Murich received the ball in the restricted area and shot hard. Xu Yulong flew to block it, but he could not stop Hengda from scoring the equalizing goal. However, this goal loss completely ignited the passion of the captain of Guoan. In the 35th minute, Xu Yulong made a long pass to the front court. After Hengda cleared the siege, he played a quick counter attack. Xu Yulong fouled Murich near the center line in order to stop the other side's attack, and he received a yellow card. Although this punishment is controversial, Xu Yulong uses his experience to express his dissatisfaction to the referee. Two minutes later, Pu Cheng, the young player of Guoan, also received a yellow card for fouling Murich, and Xu Yulong almost provoked a conflict with Murich in order to protest the injustice of his young teammates. In the 39th minute, Murich made an additional move to Yang Zhiguo, who had already got the ball. When the national team partners came forward to question Murich, Xu Yulong played the role of captain to comfort the partners and indicated that the other side's foul was malicious, so that Murich could get the deserved yellow card and the game could return to the normal track. If Xu Yulong's performance in the first half can be described as passionate, then Xu Yulong in the second half can be described as bloody. Whether it is the steady header clearance and card position interception in the middle road, or the timely replenishment defense in the two flanks, it shows that the veteran is in good condition and has rich experience. In particular, in the 80th minute of the game, Murich made a single pass in the restricted area of Guoan. Fortunately, Xu Yulong made a flying backward hook clearance to resolve this danger, but his left foot was also injured because of this clearance. What happened next made the captain of Guoan angry. While the team doctor was examining the injury, the staff carrying the stretcher hit Xu Yulong's head with the stretcher, signaling him to get on the stretcher quickly. This rude act surprised the battle hardened captain of Guoan, who was also unbearable. He stood up on one leg to criticize the stretcher bearers. However, the Hengda forward Cleo still came forward to indicate that Xu Yulong was injured to delay the game time. In the end, Xu Yulong still limped out of the field under the support of the team doctor for treatment. (Click to watch the video) Although Murich's super personal ability caused a lot of trouble, it is hard to hide that Xu Yulong, an old captain, showed his leadership, fighting spirit and rich experience in the game at the critical moment. As early as the preparation period before the season, Xu Yulong adjusted his physical condition, especially his weight, to the best value in recent years through hard training. In view of the fact that he lost his single sword in the first round of the league against Jiangsu, we can see that although he is over 30 years old, Xu Yulong's leadership position in the National Security Team is still unshakable, especially in the absence of internal and external aid supplements this year, Xu Yulong's existence is particularly precious. While cheering for the veteran, we have to see the hidden worries: how many years can Xu Yulong maintain this status? When the captain is not up to the job, who can the national security defense line rely on? I look forward to the rapid growth of young players and the supplementation of high-level internal and external aids, so that this National Security contributor can one day fade out with confidence.

魔兽交接停服15天网游厂商争夺500万玩家每经记者任思强发自北京2009年6月7日，已在中国运营近5年的《魔兽世界》将迎来停服日。值得关注的是，在《魔兽世界》7日凌晨关闭全部服务器后，数量达500万之巨的魔兽玩家至少在半个月内处于无游戏可玩的状态——一场围绕着“魔兽”玩家展开的15日争夺战即将上演。争夺500万魔兽玩家据了解，在《魔兽世界》6月7日停服日来临前夕，网易已经从九城手中拿到了《魔兽世界》全部数据。5月31日，九城发布公告，首次就《魔兽世界》易主事件做出明确表态，称九城运营的《魔兽世界》将于2009年6月7日凌晨0时起终止服务，玩家点卡款项返还工作将于6月7日启动。同一天，网易方面表示，网易《魔兽世界》服务器将全部采用新的设备，网易和暴雪双方计划在6月下旬开放第一批服务器，并在几周内开放其他全部服务器。这意味着，数量达500万之巨的魔兽玩家至少在半个月内处于无游戏可玩的状态。针对这一空档，其他的网游厂商开始发力抢占市场。日前，金山软件宣布，《剑侠情缘网络版叁》(以下简称《剑网3》)将于6月10日启动百万玩家“极限封测”，邀请百万玩家参与测试，玩家可于6月5日起申请测试资格体验游戏。金山此次大规模放号，正值《魔兽世界》数据交接之际，抢占真空期的意图明显。此前，蓝港在线董事长兼CEO王峰公布了公司2009年战略布局，旗下三款网络游戏《问鼎》、《西游记》和《佣兵天下》将抢占市场份额。除此外，巨人游戏的掌门人史玉柱也在寻找《征途》的继任者，搜狐的张朝阳与畅游CEO王韬正在考虑《天龙八部》的后续产品，而盛大陈天桥早就给《永恒之塔》贴上了“韩国版魔兽”的标签。“实际上，盛大提前推出《永恒之塔》，就是为了拉拢对游戏画面效果要求较高的魔兽玩家，而即将在今年第二季度面市的金山《剑网3》也是魔兽玩家的有力争夺者。”一位在网游业工作多年的业内人士告诉《每日经济新闻》记者，《魔兽世界》消失的15天，必将是其他网游竞争最激烈的15天。新一轮PK即将展开《魔兽世界》的易主会给网游业带来什么样的变化？昨日，易观国际网络游戏分析师黄超在接受《每日经济新闻》采访时称，《魔兽世界》的易主在短期内不会出现对整个市场环境产生过大影响，但2009年对于中国网络游戏市场颇为特殊，也使得行业充满不定因素。“由于魔兽世界在中国出现空档期，2009年对于中国网络游戏公司以及国外厂商都是一个机遇，除了《永恒之塔》、《剑网3》之外，海外游戏厂商EA和暴雪的《星际争霸二》也将登陆中国市场。”黄超称。与此同时，对于刚刚签下“魔兽”网易来说，最新财报上的数字或许并不会太出色。“从目前来看，网易需要收购九城手中的点卡，并补偿停机费用。另外按照与暴雪的协议规定，需投入大量最新服务器搭建架构，前期成本可想而知。”黄超表示。分析人士认为，九城在失去“魔兽”之后将迎来转型期，这段时期难以找回之前的市场份额；盛大在推出《永恒之塔》后，可能将逐步拉开和竞争对手的差距；腾讯凭借《地下城与勇士》以及多款成功产品，将稳固当前的位置；由于网易《魔兽世界》将于4季度正式完成商业化运营，加上《天龙八部》的稳定收入(注：此处应为《梦幻西游》，《天龙八部》不是网易运营)，前三名的位置不会有太大改变。但该分析人士表示，“网易能否凭借《魔兽世界》在年内赶超盛大、腾讯，现在不好预测。”易观国际发布的《2009年第一季度中国网络市场季度检测》数据显示，由于用户增长，2009年第一季度中国网络游戏市场收入规模达55.14亿元，环比增长达8.3%。上季度，九城市场份额滑落，将第四名的位置让给了搜狐畅游。黄超表示，这主要是由于九城的《巫妖王之怒》审批推迟，造成玩家上线积极性下降；而搜狐畅游凭借《天龙八部》，用户形成了持续增长。国内网游格局，已经到了瞬息万变的局面。业界观察：平台化成网游发展趋势每经记者任思强发自北京“魔兽风波”尘埃落定后，网易手握《大话西游》、《魔兽世界》及《星际争霸2》等数款大作，横跨自主研发和代理两大纵区，俨然成为最宽广的网游运营平台。多方分析也认为，门户网的优势和多年成功运营经验是网易此番胜出的重要原因。平台化是网游产业近年发展的新趋势，它是指一家厂商或多家厂商联合，将自身拥有的各种资源整合起来为一款产品服务。相较于传统的运营模式，平台化协调统一了各方力量，故能形成强大的合力，从而实现效率最大化。2009年年初，金山和盛大联合运营《剑侠世界》、《剑网2》，此后盛大又相继与蓝港在线、千橡互动、联众世界等厂商签订了联合运营协议。随着这一系列联合运营的掀起，金山等自主研发能力出众的厂商开始向网游研发平台发展，盛大等厂商则向网游运营平台转型，平台化渐成主流。实际上，此番《魔兽世界》易主也带有强烈的平台化特色，九城的运营平台与网易虽然不可相提并论，但其密谋代理《剑侠情缘网络版叁》的举动也透露出借力金山研发平台来弥补损失的想法。本报之前曾报道，九城总裁陈晓薇此前造访金山位于珠海的西山居开发工作室。业内人士普遍认为，此次陈晓薇与金山董事长兼CEO求伯君进行对话，主要是谈与金山今年重量级的网游产品《剑侠情缘网络版叁》的合作计划。分析人士预测，“魔兽风波”余波未了，网游厂商将掀起更大规模的竞争狂潮，而最终决定胜负的还是各款产品所依托的平台强弱。	陈天桥,史玉柱,王韬,张朝阳,任思强,黄超,求伯君,王峰,陈晓薇	正向	"The World of Warcraft handover was suspended for 15 days, and the online game manufacturers competed for 5 million players. Ren Siqiang, a reporter from Beijing, On June 7, 2009, the World of Warcraft, which has been in operation in China for nearly 5 years, will usher in the day of server shutdown. It is worth noting that after the World of Warcraft closed all servers at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 7th, the huge number of 5 million World of Warcraft players will be in a state of no game to play for at least half a month - a 15 day battle centered on the ""World of Warcraft"" players is about to begin. It is understood that in order to compete for 5 million World of Warcraft players, Netease has won the complete data of World of Warcraft from the hands of the Nine Cities on the eve of June 7, the stop serving day of World of Warcraft. On May 31, the Nine Cities issued a public announcement for the first time to make a clear statement on the event of World of Warcraft's change of ownership, saying that the World of Warcraft operated by the Nine Cities will terminate its service from 0:00 on the morning of June 7, 2009, and the return of player card payments will be launched on June 7. On the same day, Netease said that Netease's World of Warcraft server will adopt new equipment in its entirety, and Netease and Blizzard planned to open the first batch of servers in late June and open all other servers in a few weeks. This means that the huge number of 5 million Warcraft players will be in a state of no game to play for at least half a month. In view of this gap, other online game manufacturers began to strive to seize the market. Recently, Kingsoft announced that ""Jianxia Qingyuan Network Version III"" (hereinafter referred to as ""Jianwang 3"") will start the ""limit closed test"" of one million players on June 10, inviting one million players to apply for the test qualification to experience the game since June 5. Kingsoft's massive release of numbers is at the moment of World of Warcraft data handover, and it is obvious that it intends to seize the vacuum period. Earlier, Wang Feng, Chairman and CEO of Blue Harbor Online, announced the company's 2009 strategic layout, and the three online games under its jurisdiction, ""Ask for the Top"", ""Journey to the West"" and ""Bingbing World"", will seize their share of the market. In addition, Shi Yuzhu, the chief master of Giant Game, is also looking for the successor of ""Zhengzhou"", Zhang Chaoyang of Sohu and Wang Tao, the CEO of Changyou, are considering the follow-up product of ""Tianlong Babu"", and Chen Tianqiao of Snda has long pasted the label of ""Korean version of Warcraft"" on ""Tower of Eternity"". ""In fact, Snda launched the Tower of Eternity in advance in order to win the World of Warcraft players who have high requirements on the game picture effect, and the upcoming Jinshan's ""Sword Net 3"" in the second quarter of this year is also a strong contender for the World of Warcraft players."" An industry insider who has worked in the online game industry for many years told Nandu reporters that the 15 days when the World of Warcraft disappeared will inevitably be the most fierce 15 days of competition for other online games. What changes will the handover of the ownership of World of Warcraft bring to the online game industry? Yesterday, Huang Chao, an international online game analyst of Yi Gu, said in an interview with Nandu that the handover of the World of Warcraft would not have a significant impact on the entire market environment in the short term, but 2009 was very special for the Chinese online game market, which also made the industry full of uncertainty. ""Due to the gap period of World of Warcraft in China, 2009 is an opportunity for Chinese online game companies and foreign manufacturers. In addition to the Tower of Eternity and Swordnet 3, overseas game manufacturers EA and Blizzard's StarCraft II will also land in the Chinese market."" Huang Chao said. At the same time, for Netease, which has just signed the ""World of Warcraft"", the figures in the latest financial report may not be too good. ""At present, Netease needs to purchase the card in the hands of the Nine Cities and compensate for the shutdown fees. In addition, according to the agreement with Blizzard, a large number of new servers need to be invested to build the structure, and the initial cost can be imagined."" Said Huang Chao. Analysts believe that after losing ""World of Warcraft"", the Nine Cities will usher in the transformation period, and it is difficult to recover the previous market share during this period; Snda will gradually open the gap with competitors after launching the Tower of Eternity; Tencent will stabilize its current position with the help of the successful products of ""Dungeon and Warrior""; Snda has given the label of ""Korean version of Warcraft"" to the Tower of Eternity because Netease's World of Warcraft will officially complete the commercial operation in the fourth quarter, combined with the stable income of ""Tianlong Babu"" (Note: This should be ""Dream Journey to the West"", not ""Tianlong Babu"", which is not operated by Netease), the top three positions will not change much. But the analyst said, ""It is hard to predict now whether Netease can surpass Snda and Tencent with the help of World of Warcraft in the year."" The data released by iMedia International's ""China Internet Market Quarterly Test in the First Quarter of 2009"" shows that due to user growth, the income scale of China's online game market reached 5.514 billion yuan in the first quarter of 2009, with a month on month growth of 8.3%. Last quarter, the market share of the Nine Cities slid, giving the fourth place to Sohu Changyou. Huang Chao said that this was mainly due to the delay in approving the Nine Cities' Wrath of the Lich King, which led to a decline in players' willingness to go online; Sohu Changyou's users formed a continuous growth with the help of Tian Long Babu. The domestic online game pattern has reached a situation of rapid change. Industry observation: platformization has become the development trend of online games. Ren Siqiang, a reporter from Nandu, sent from Beijing. After the ""World of Warcraft incident"" was settled, Netease held several masterpieces in its hands, such as ""Dream Journey to the West"", ""World of Warcraft"" and ""StarCraft 2"", spanning two vertical zones of independent research and development and agency, and has become the most extensive online game operation platform. It is also believed by many analysts that the advantages of the portal website and years of successful operation experience are the main reasons for Netease's success this time. Platformization is a new trend in the development of the online game industry in recent years, which refers to a manufacturer or several manufacturers jointly integrate their own various resources to serve a product. Compared with the traditional operation mode, platformization coordinates and unifies various forces, so it can form a powerful synergy, thus realizing the maximization of efficiency. At the beginning of 2009, Kingsoft and Snda jointly operated ""Sword World"" and ""Sword Net 2"". Later, Snda successively signed joint operation agreements with Blue Harbor Online, Qianxiang Interactive, Unijoin World and other manufacturers. With the launch of this series of joint operations, Kingsoft and other manufacturers with outstanding self-developed capabilities began to develop towards the online game development platform, and Snda and other manufacturers began to transform towards the online game operation platform, and platformization gradually became the mainstream. In fact, this change of ownership of World of Warcraft also has strong platform characteristics. Although the operation platform of the Nine Cities is not comparable to that of Netease, its move to plot the agency of ""Jianxia Qingyuan Network Version San"" also reveals the idea of leveraging the Kingsoft Research and Development Platform to make up for the loss. This newspaper previously reported that Chen Xiaowei, President of the Nine Cities, visited the Xishanju Development Studio of Kingsoft in Zhuhai. Industry insiders generally believe that Chen Xiaowei's dialogue with Qi Bojun, Chairman and CEO of Kingsoft this time is mainly to talk about the cooperation plan with Kingsoft's weight game product ""Jianxia Qingyuan Network Version San"" this year. Analysts predict that the aftermath of the ""World of Warcraft incident"" has not yet been resolved, and online game manufacturers will掀起a larger competition craze, and the platform strength on which each product depends will ultimately determine the winner."
谢旭人：要把稳定物价总水平放在更加突出位置人民网北京3月7日电(人民网前方报道组)今日14：30，十一届全国人大四次会议新闻中心举行主题为“财政政策和有关问题”的记者会。财政部部长谢旭人在会上表示，要把稳定物价总水平放在更加突出的位置。谢旭人表示，今年中央决定实施积极的财政政策，这是中国政府在全面分析当前国内国际经济环境变化的基础上做出的一个重大决策。当前世界经济尽管在逐步复苏，但是复苏的基础还不够牢固，不确定性、不稳定性还存在。我国经济要保持平稳较快的发展，也需要应对这些影响，还需要必要的政策支持。谢旭人说，与此同时，我们近几年为应对国际金融危机的冲击增加了公共投资，有不少在建的项目还需要继续增加投入。今年又是“十二五”规划的开局之年，有计划地启动“十二五”规划重大项目，加强经济社会发展的薄弱环节，进一步提高保障和改善民生的水平，这些都需要加大财政投入，所以要继续实施积极的财政政策。谢旭人说，落实好这个财政政策，要更加积极稳妥地处理好保持经济平稳较快发展，调整经济结构与管理好通货膨胀预期的关系，而且要把稳定物价总水平放在更加突出的位置。谢旭人说，今年财政预算赤字占GDP的比重进一步下降，预算赤字比去年减少1500亿元，全国财政赤字占GDP的比重，去年是2.5%，今年可望进一步下降到2%左右。与此同时，在财政政策实施过程中，我们更加注重在调整经济结构、提高经济发展的质量和效益，切实保障和改善民生方面下更大的工夫。按照要把稳定价格总水平放在更加突出的位置上这一要求，我们在财政政策的过程中，大力支持和促进诸如粮食、棉花、蔬菜、糖料、肉类、肉禽蛋奶等人民生活必需品的生产和供应。进一步清理、规范流通领域各种收费，进一步做好促进化肥、农药、薄膜等农用生产资料的供应以及价格的管理，促进增加这些方面的供应。	谢旭人	正向	"Xie Xuren: We should give priority to stabilizing the general price level. People's Daily Online, Beijing, March 7 (People's Daily online frontline reporting group) At 14:30 today, the news center of the Fourth Session of the Eleventh National People's Congress held a press conference on the theme of ""fiscal policy and relevant issues"". Xie Xuren, Minister of the Ministry of Finance, said at the meeting that we should give priority to stabilizing the overall price level. Xie Xuren said that this year, the central government has decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy, which is a major decision made by the Chinese government on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the current changes in the domestic and international economic environment. Although the current world economy is recovering gradually, the foundation of recovery is not firm enough, and uncertainty and instability still exist. In order to maintain stable and rapid development of our economy, we also need to deal with these effects and need necessary policy support. Xie Xuren said that at the same time, we have increased public investment in recent years to cope with the impact of the international financial crisis, and there are many projects under construction that need to continue to increase investment. This year is also the beginning of the Twelfth Five Year Plan, and we need to increase fiscal investment, so we should continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to start major projects of the Twelfth Five Year Plan in a planned way, strengthen the weak links of economic and social development, and further improve the level of guaranteeing and improving people's livelihood. Xie Xuren said that in order to implement this fiscal policy well, we should more actively and prudently deal with the relationship between maintaining the stable and rapid development of the economy, adjusting the economic structure and managing inflation expectations, and we should give priority to stabilizing the overall price level. Xie Xuren said that this year, the proportion of the fiscal budget deficit to GDP further declined, the budget deficit decreased by 150 billion yuan from last year, and the proportion of the national fiscal deficit to GDP was 2.5% last year, and it is expected to further decline to around 2% this year. At the same time, in the process of implementing the fiscal policy, we pay more attention to adjusting the economic structure, improving the quality and efficiency of economic development, and effectively guaranteeing and improving people's livelihood. In accordance with the requirement of giving priority to stabilizing the overall level of prices, we have strongly supported and promoted the production and supply of people's living necessities such as grain, cotton, vegetables, sugar, meat, meat, poultry and eggs in the process of fiscal policy. Further clean up and standardize various charges in the circulation field, and do a better job in promoting the supply and price management of agricultural production materials such as fertilizer, pesticide and film to promote the supply in these aspects."

女医生赴川救灾被辞退向单位索赔210万汶川地震后，重庆女医生娄继英旷工去灾区服务三天，被医院按“自动离职”处理，一时间在网络上引起巨大反响。南京一名女子有着跟娄继英同样的遭遇。她姓姜，是南京搜房网市场部的工作人员。因为被灾区的惨状所牵动，她在单位没有批准的情况下赴川赈灾，回来后遭到辞退。姜女士无法接受解聘决定，在她看来，自己擅自离岗的行为在救灾期间就已得到单位认可——她在灾区一直以单位志愿者自居，而单位也一直将她作为正面典型进行宣传。然而公司并没有为此改变决策，最近大半年来，她一直在维权。记者昨天获悉，她已经起诉单位，索赔各项赔偿金及加班工资合计200多万元。南京玄武区法院刚刚受理此案。与三名志愿者一同去救灾姜女士原本是南京搜房网市场部的一名工作人员。在接受记者采访时，她表示，汶川特大地震发生后，她每天不管工作有多忙，都要抽空上网、看电视，关注救援进展情况。“但是了解得越多，心就揪得越紧。”灾区满目疮痍，到处是生离死别，屋漏偏逢连夜雨，伤者躺在雨水中……看着这一幕幕的惨状，姜女士怎么也止不住眼泪，她产生了一种强烈的想法：到灾区去！做一点力所能及的事帮助他们！去年5月14日晚上，她给公司领导发了条短信，请求前往灾区，但没有得到准许。“我一夜都没闭眼，灾区的惨状一直在脑中回旋。”姜女士说，因为心情太迫切，紧接着她又找过领导两次，但领导还是不太支持，说她工作太忙，没时间去做志愿者。尽管协商未果，姜女士还是不愿放弃。她一方面抓紧安排手头的工作，另一方面将赴灾区做志愿者的想法与几个客户进行了沟通，并得到他们的积极响应。5月17日下午5点，她毅然与其他三名志愿者乘坐飞机抵达灾区。公司一直“正面宣传”到达灾区后，姜女士跟同伴们立即投身到救灾工作中去。5月19日，了解到灾区帐篷告急，姜女士第一时间与南京方面取得联系，紧急征调了一批帐篷；20日，帮助某开发商联系捐建希望小学事宜……他们跑遍了都江堰、什邡、汶川、映秀等重灾区，做了很多工作。“我始终以搜房网志愿者自居，我是代表公司参与赈灾。”姜女士说，她在灾区时一直跟公司保持密切联系，先后发回大量文字、照片、DV短片，这些鲜活的资料都出现在公司网站的报道中。如今，姜女士已将这些报道打印下来作为证据，还进行了公证。昨天在法院，记者看到，在该网站2008年5月18日的报道《灾区紧急动员令》一文中，第一段开头写道：“由南京搜房发起的奔赴四川灾区的志愿者队伍一行四人，于17日下午5点乘飞机抵达成都。这支志愿者队伍包括南京搜房姜×……”而其他报道中，也多次出现“搜房志愿者”、“唯一的女性队员姜×”等字眼。“看到公司在报道中这样称呼我，我心里的石头放下了。”姜女士认为，公司将她作为抗灾正面典型加以宣传，是认可她到灾区做志愿者的意思。一回来就收到解聘通知然而，姜女士无论如何也没想到，她5月28日早上一赶到单位就被领导叫去谈话。领导指责她不打招呼就擅自离岗，并表示不再欢迎她回来上班。几天后，她收到了解聘通知。“救灾不能作为违反公司规章制度的借口。”该公司一位负责人表示，从道义上来讲，姜女士去灾区做志愿者是值得称道的，但作为一名公司职员，她出发前没有得到批准，领导也没签字同意，属于严重违反劳动纪律的行为。根据该公司的规章制度，旷工三天就视为自动离职，姜女士都已经旷工七天了，情况比较严重，解除劳动合同是合理的。员工认为救灾是职务行为姜女士无法接受单位的解聘决定。她认为，单位网站的报道，事实上已经认可她组织的志愿者团队为搜房志愿者分队，认可她本人搜房志愿者的身份，同时还采用了她从抗灾前线发回的图文，这就意味着，她在灾区工作的行为属于职务行为。因此，单位以旷工为由与她解除劳动关系是没有事实与法律依据的。“即便不谈法理，但从情感上，公司做的也说不过去。”姜女士认为，自己代表公司在灾区做志愿者，事实上也给公司带来了好的影响。记者昨天下午致电南京搜房网，公司一位负责人表示，将在庭审中出具证据批驳姜女士的观点。状告公司索赔210多万去年6月，姜女士向南京市玄武区劳动争议仲裁委员会提起仲裁，要求公司继续履行劳动合同。后因仲裁审理期限已过，她书面申请终止仲裁，并在今年3月底向南京市玄武区法院提起诉讼。这次，她不再要求公司继续履行劳动合同，而是提出了巨额索赔，包括83.4万违法解约赔偿金，41.7万的解除劳动合同经济补偿金，以及20余万的额外补偿金。并要求单位支付其未发工资、业务提成、加班工资合计74万余元等。陈珊珊	陈珊珊,姜女士,娄继英	负向	"A female doctor was fired for going to Sichuan to rescue and claimed 2.1 million yuan from the unit. After the Wenchuan earthquake, a female doctor in Chongqing, Lou Jiying, went to the disaster area to serve for three days and was treated by the hospital as ""automatic resignation"", which caused a great reaction on the Internet. A woman in Nanjing has the same experience as Lou Jiying. Her surname is Jiang, and she is a staff member of the market department of Nanjing Soufun. Because of the terrible situation in the disaster area, she went to Sichuan for relief without the approval of the unit and was dismissed when she returned. Ms. Jiang could not accept the dismissal decision. In her view, her擅自deration from her post had been recognized by the unit during the rescue period - she always regarded herself as a volunteer of the unit in the disaster area, and the unit also publicized her as a positive model. However, the company did not change its decision for this reason, and in the past six months, she has been维权ing. Yesterday, the reporter learned that she had sued the unit for a total of more than 2 million yuan for various compensation and overtime pay. The court of Xuanwu District, Nanjing has just accepted the case. Jiang女士， who went to rescue with three volunteers, was originally a staff member of the market department of Nanjing Soufun. In an interview with reporters, she said that after the special earthquake in Wenchuan, no matter how busy her job was, she had to take time to surf the Internet and watch TV to pay attention to the progress of rescue.""But the more you know, the tighter your heart will be."" The disaster area is full of scars. There are births and deaths everywhere. It's raining all night. The wounded lie in the rain... Seeing these scenes of misery, Ms. Jiang could not help crying. She had a strong idea: to go to the disaster area! Do what you can to help them! On the evening of May 14 last year, she sent a short message to the company leader, requesting to go to the disaster area, but he was not allowed.""I didn't close my eyes all night, and the terrible situation in the disaster area kept revolving in my mind."" Jiang said that because she was too eager, she went to the leader twice in a row, but the leader still did not support her, saying that she was too busy to work as a volunteer. Despite the fact that the negotiation was fruitless, Ms. Jiang was still unwilling to give up. On the one hand, she tried to arrange her work at hand, and on the other hand, she communicated her ideas of going to the disaster area to volunteer with several customers, and won their positive response. At 5:00 p.m. on May 17, she and three other volunteers flew to the disaster area. The company has always ""publicized"" the positive arrival of the disaster area, and Ms. Jiang and her companions immediately devoted themselves to the rescue work. On May 19, learning that the disaster area was in urgent need of tents, Ms. Jiang immediately contacted Nanjing to urgently allocate a batch of tents; On the 20th, help a developer to contact the hope primary school for donation and construction... They ran through the earthquake-stricken areas such as Dujiangyan, Shifang, Wenchuan, and Yingxiu, and did a lot of work.""I always regard myself as a volunteer of Soufun. I am a participant in the relief on behalf of the company."" Jiang said that when she was in the disaster area, she always kept in close contact with the company, and then sent a large number of texts, photos, and DV short films. These vivid materials all appeared in the company's website reports. Now, Ms. Jiang has printed out these reports as evidence and notarized them. Yesterday, in court, the reporter saw that in the report ""Disaster Area Emergency Mobilization Order"" of the website on May 18, 2008, the first paragraph began with: ""The four member volunteer team, which was initiated by Soufun in Nanjing and went to Sichuan, arrived in Chengdu by plane at 5:00 p.m. on the 17th. This volunteer team includes Jiang X of Nanjing Soufun..."" In other reports, there were also many words such as ""Soufun volunteers"" and ""Jiang X, the only female team member"". ""Seeing that the company calls me in this way in the report, the stone in my heart has put down."" Jiang believes that the company's publicity of her as an anti disaster model means that she is recognized to go to the disaster area as a volunteer. However, when she came back, she received a dismissal notice. However, Ms. Jiang never expected that when she arrived at the unit on the morning of May 28, she was invited by the leader to talk. The leader blamed her for leaving her post without saying hello and said that she was no longer welcome to come back to work. A few days later, she received a dismissal notice.""Disaster relief cannot be an excuse for violating company rules and regulations."" A responsible person of the company said that, in terms of morality, it is praiseworthy for Ms. Jiang to go to the disaster area to volunteer as a company employee, but she did not get approval before leaving, and the leader did not sign his agreement, which was a serious violation of labor discipline. According to the rules and regulations of the company, being absent from work for three days is considered as automatic resignation. Ms. Jiang has been absent from work for seven days, which is a serious case, so it is reasonable to terminate the labor contract. Employees believe that disaster relief is a job Jiang女士can not accept the unit's dismissal decision. She believes that the report of the unit's website has in fact recognized the volunteer team she organized as the Soufang Volunteer Detachment, and recognized her as a Soufang volunteer. At the same time, she also adopted the pictures and texts she sent back from the front line of the disaster relief, which means that her behavior in the disaster area is a job. As a result, the unit has no facts or legal basis to terminate its labor relationship with her on the ground of being absent from work.""Even if we do not talk about legal principles, but from an emotional perspective, what the company does is unjustifiable."" Jiang believes that she is a volunteer in the disaster area on behalf of the company, which actually has a good impact on the company. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter called Nanjing Soufun. A responsible person of the company said that he would present evidence in the trial to refute Ms. Jiang's view. Sue the company for compensation of more than 2.1 million Last June, Ms. Jiang filed an arbitration with the Xuanwu District Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee of Nanjing, requiring the company to continue to perform the labor contract. Later, because the deadline for arbitration had expired, she applied in writing to terminate the arbitration and filed a lawsuit with the court of Xuanwu District, Nanjing at the end of March this year. This time, she no longer required the company to continue to perform the labor contract, but made a huge claim, including 834000 yuan of illegal contract termination compensation, 417000 yuan of economic compensation for termination of the labor contract, and more than 200000 yuan of additional compensation. And requires the unit to pay a total of 740000 yuan and so on, including unpaid wages, business commission, overtime pay. Chen Shanshan"

Chinanews Beijing, August 10- President Bush of the United States, who ignored the obstruction of a very small number of people and came to Beijing to watch the Olympic Games, enjoyed this Olympic journey with his family and tasted the delicious Olympic dinner. At 10:00 pm on the 10th evening, in Wukesong Basketball Gym, he watched the men's basketball game between China and the United States. During the game, he cheered for American athletes and was very involved. After attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games and watching the performance with great interest, Bush's figure has appeared in the beach volleyball stadium, the ""Water Cube"" and the Wukesong Basketball Gym like a horse lantern for the past two days. He is using his limited stay time to enjoy the wonderful Olympic Games as much as possible, and to cheer for American players. Bush is the cheerleader captain of the US Olympic delegation, and he has been very competent so far. At the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, he expressed his greatest support to the athletes of the American team. On the morning of the 9th, he came to Chaoyang Park to visit the American beach volleyball team that was preparing for the battle. He also took the initiative to join them, discussed ball skills with the sexy and beautiful team members, and took photos with them. On the same day, he also visited the athletes of the American softball team. Bush has brought encouragement and good luck to the American team. With his on-site support, the swimming star Phelps won the first gold medal of the Beijing Olympic Games for the American team and broke the world record. After watching the women's basketball game of the United States on the 9th, Bush came to Wukesong Basketball Gym again on the 10th. At the beginning of last month, when Bush attended the G8 summit in Japan, he asked Chinese President Hu Jintao for a ticket to this game. This game ticket is one of the most popular tickets for this Olympic Games. Bush has finally got the ticket he has long dreamed of. The game started at ten fifteen in the evening, and Bush came to the basketball court early. With him were his wife Laura, his father, former US President Bush, his mother, and Yang Jiechi, the accompanying Chinese Foreign Minister. They were warmly welcomed by the audience and the players of the American team on the spot. Bush looked very relaxed in his blue shirt. At the beginning of the game, the Chinese team scored two three-point shots by Sun Yue and Yao Ming, taking the lead in the United States. This also made Bush look bad and very embarrassing, supporting his chin with his finger and saying nothing. The American escorts beside him tried to communicate with him, and he helplessly shrugged and spread his hands helplessly. The US team then seized the opportunity to overtake the score to 7-6, and the gloom on Bush's face dissipated, his face turned from阴to sunny, and he clapped his hands full of spring breeze and whispered to his family. However, the Chinese team then exceeded the score again. Although the people around were clapping, Bush looked gloomy and very nervous. The US team then scored a small climax of 7-0 to equalize the score. Bush's excitement is hard to contain. Later, the two sides fell into a tug of war, and Bush leaned back against his seat to ease his nervous mind. In the second quarter, the American team once led by nine points. However, the Chinese team equalized the score under the leadership of Yao Ming. Bush leaned forward,探out half of his body, and looked at the game on the court without blinking his eyes. He seemed more nervous than others. Seeing that the American team had scored three consecutive attacks, Bush, who had taken a confidence pill, turned to Yang Jiechi for a few exchanges, pointing his finger at the court, as if he were very competent. But the subsequent counterattack of the Chinese team was also very effective, and the American officials who accompanied Bush were applauding for Yao Ming's performance, but he was still motionless. Seven minutes into the second quarter, James broke through the layup, and Bush raised his hands high over his head to applaud the American team. Then, the US team launched a beautiful attack, widening the lead to more than ten points. Bush was slightly relieved, he put up his legs, and relaxed. At the end of the first half, the American team was leading by 49-37, and Bush, who was dry, remembered to drink water. While drinking water, he watched the lion dance performance with Chinese folk flavor on the court. He enjoyed it so much that he asked questions from time to time to the Chinese accompanying personnel. In the second half, the Chinese team's defense was terrible, and the American team simply played a dunk show. Bush was very happy to watch, nodding his head from time to time and smiling smugly. There were six minutes and fifty four seconds left in the last quarter, and the US team scored a big lead of 84 to 50 over China.

I have read the novel of manager Li Ke, the movie of Cai Nv Xu Jinglei, the TV series of Huadan Wang Luodan, and the play of Dajue Yao Chen... I heard that the movie and TV of Durar拉升职记2: Huazhuo is like a year of water; I heard that Ainol MP4 can play like a year of water in my ear... Yes, Ainol (ainol), the first brand of HD, advocates the new culture of ""listening"" to books for leisure, and jointly launches the ""listening to books together"" campaign with Sowinke, the leading brand of genuine audio books, and the first wave of audio books Durarla Edition V9000HDA is launched in a limited edition, preloaded with the genuine HD audio of Durarla 2, and comes with a 500 yuan listening card (including the lifetime free download and trial listening of audio books with a paper book value of more than 40000 yuan), which will be released in a limited edition from October 1, 2010 to October 31, 2010. Now, let's follow the V9000HDA version of Durarla into the watery years of Durarla. Huazhuo said that you were too busy with your work, you said that you were tired of learning, you said that the pressure was too great, you said that the burden was too heavy, and you said that there were too many restrictions... The world is a huge whirlpool, dragging people forward. Everyone has his own water like years. Going to and from work, going to and from school, going on a journey... At any time, take the V9000HDA version of Durarla with you, plug in your earphones, sigh and understand yourself: ""Many moods have not been released at that time, either because there is no time, or because there is no one to talk to.

As a PROBLEMSOLVER with all kinds of problems in his chest, Durarla is becoming more and more powerful. When the shortcomings and loveliness of women are increasingly replaced by professional maturity and rules, people can't help wondering whether ""maturity"" is a compliment or a derogatory term?

Everyone has difficulties. For Sha Dangdang, who was born after 80s, love is not a problem. The problem is the property rights of the house; For Du LaLa, who was born after 70s, breaking up is not a problem. The problem is that there is no better love. La La, who lost in the broadband salary system, decided to jump槽， with a bad mood, on a long job seeking road in the hot summer of 2006... As a famous ""stubborn donkey"", she always thought: you and I will have a long love... Listening without worries, it's not enough to listen to ""Durarla 2""? Then let's continue.

When they expressed their joy, they also felt that their alma mater, Nanda, adopted such a ""与时俱进"" and ""lovely"" way to show themselves. Microblog, namely microblog, is a new web2.0 performance. It is a blog like system with extremely fast interaction and dissemination. Its biggest feature is integration and openness.

The publicity method of ""fan reprint and diffusion"" and the convenient means of mobile terminal access played a positive role. Many fans also made suggestions to Nanda's admissions work through comments and private messages. Some of them were quickly implemented, which had a positive effect. The fan ""Sunshine"" once told a reporter that he had commented or sent a private message to the microblog of other universities, but he did not get a reply. Nanda is the only one who replied to his admissions office's microblog. ""'Teacher Zhao' sounds like a dialogue with people."" Fans also jokingly call themselves ""Zhao Tuan""."
杜堡签邵佳一后宣布再引前腰高官：他放弃德甲来这里新浪体育讯　北京时间5月20日晚，德乙球队杜伊斯堡官方宣布与本赛季效力于德乙FSV法兰克福的德国球员尤尔根-加苏拉签约两年，这位26岁的球员今夏与球队合同到期，因此杜伊斯堡不用花一分钱转会费即可得到他。拥有德国和阿尔巴尼亚双重国籍的加苏拉司职前腰，新赛季他将成为中国球员邵佳一在球队攻击型前卫位置上的队友和有力竞争对手。加苏拉上赛季在德乙出场32次，共斩获6个进球和7次助攻。在得到他之后俱乐部主帅萨西奇在官网上称：“加苏拉是一名速度很快的中场球员，他拥有很好的视野、很高的传球成功率以及不错的盘带技术。”而俱乐部体育主管布鲁诺-胡布内尔则透露：“加苏拉本来有机会去德甲效力，是俱乐部的理念最终说服了他加盟杜伊斯堡，他会在这里展示他的潜能。”加苏拉也成为了杜伊斯堡在今年夏天签下的第二名攻击型中场球员，此前引进的邵佳一虽然在科特布斯大部分时间出任右前卫，但踢法路数实际上则是一名前腰，攻击更侧重于中路。新赛季两名球员在攻击型中场的位置上既需要合作也面临竞争，但对于已经年过30的邵佳一来说，竞争早已经是家常便饭，尽管杜伊斯堡没有给过佳一任何的主力承诺，但相信已经做好充分准备的他会给球队带来更多的惊喜。(Aaritalo)	尤尔根-加苏拉,布鲁诺-胡布内尔,邵佳一,萨西奇	正向	"After signing Shao Jiayi, Du Bao announced that he would introduce another former waist high official: He gave up the Bundesliga to come here. Sina Sports News On the evening of May 20, Beijing time, the official announcement of Duisburg, a German team in the Second Bundesliga, announced that Jürgen Gasula, a German player who played for FSV Frankfurt in the Second Bundesliga this season, had signed a two-year contract with the team. The 26-year-old player's contract with the team expired this summer, so Duisburg did not have to spend a penny to get him. Gasulla, who has dual German and Albanian nationalities and is an attacking midfielder, will become a teammate and strong competitor of Chinese player Shao Jiayi in the team's attacking midfielder position in the new season. Gasulla played 32 times in the Second Bundesliga last season, scoring 6 goals and 7 assists. After getting him, Sasic, the head coach of the club, said on the official website: ""Gasulla is a fast midfielder, he has a good vision, a high passing success rate and a good dribbling technology."" Bruno Hubner, the head of sports of the club, revealed that ""Gasula originally had the opportunity to play in the Bundesliga, but it was the concept of the club that finally convinced him to join Duisburg, where he will demonstrate his potential."" Gasula also became the second attacking midfielder signed by Duisburg this summer. Shao Jiayi, who was introduced earlier, served as the right winger for most of the time in Cottbus, but he was actually an attacking midfielder, focusing on the middle road. In the new season, the two players need both cooperation and competition in the position of attacking midfielder. However, for Shao Jiayi, who has already reached 30 years old, competition has long been a matter of course. Although Duisburg has not given Jia Yi any main promise, it is believed that he will give the team more surprises, as he has made full preparations. (Aaritalo)"

欧洲通胀增至1.9%失业率创12年来最高纪录新浪财经讯北京时间10月29日晚间消息，据外电报道，因经济恢复出现放缓迹象，欧洲通胀率不断上升，至近两年来的最高点，失业率创下12年来的最高纪录。设在卢森堡的欧盟统计局近日表示，欧元区消费价格10月同比增长1.9%，9月同比增1.8%。1.9%的增速是2008年11月以来的最大值，超出调查经济学家所得1.8%的预期。另外有报告表示，欧盟失业率9月达10.1%，为1998年7月以来的最高值。原油价格过去两月累计上涨9.2%，欧元走强拖累出口，企业与消费者可用资金减少。经济恢复一波三折，各国政府又纷纷缩减开支应付财政赤字，各大企业便暂停员工招聘，从而进一步影响消费的增加。(楚墨)	楚墨	负向	European inflation rose to 1.9%, and the unemployment rate hit the highest level in 12 years.

Another report shows that the EU unemployment rate reached 10.1% in September, the highest since July 1998. The cumulative increase of crude oil prices in the past two months was 9.2%, the euro strengthened and dragged down exports, and the available funds for enterprises and consumers decreased. The economic recovery is complicated, and governments in various countries are cutting spending to deal with fiscal deficits, so major enterprises suspend employee recruitment, which further affects the increase of consumption.

MasaMaso：网上“男人装”文|本刊记者丁晓磊“我们是一家服装公司。”北京九合尚品科技有限公司MasaMaso总经理孙弘反复强调。很多在互联网上做服装生意的企业更愿意说自己是一家IT公司，大谈网络工具如何让产品定价低到令人咋舌的地步。孙弘则执著于做一家简单的服装公司。“顾客会通过各种渠道购买低价衣服，但不会放弃对产品质量和设计的要求。MasaMaso不仅仅在价格方面做文章，更要抓住服装的本质。”孙弘说。近两年，网络衬衣直销先锋PPG日进斗金的故事鼓舞众多知名服装公司和互联网人士跃跃欲试，投入网络服装直销的行当中。PPG过的低价捆绑战略成为该行业普遍采用的办法，即产品走中低价位，“68元一件”，“三件起仅需29元”，消费者觉得“产品即使不好，买一次也不会亏到哪里”。这样的销售方式，曾让PPG日出货量达一万件以上。这种繁荣建立在低成本、低质量和高广告投入的基础上，却难以持续。2008年底，有传言称PPG创始人李亮携款潜逃，网络服装直销行业笼罩在夜幕之下。MasaMaso在夜幕中渐渐亮起来。自2008年8月正式上线运营以来，这家企业已经达到盈亏平衡，甚至略有微利，每月处理数千份订单，客单价从开始的157元增长到平均500元，并已积累了两万多注册用户(几乎全部有购买行为)。从创办MasaMaso之初，孙弘就很看重团队成员在传统行业的经验积累。他认为，做企业必须首先抓住行业的本质，至于是做电子商务还是做实体店的销售，这只是一种形式。MasaMaso的员工有一多半来自传统服装业，这一点和PPG、凡客形成鲜明对比。事实上，孙弘自己就是服装行业的老江湖，有着十几年的从业经验。他曾任浙江凯莱股份有限公司、CLEARLUCERNE及北京威可多制衣中心的高管，在设计和采购方面有着丰富的资源。他的创业伙伴张树略曾任深圳网兴科技(中国知名SP，2004年被新浪收购)的高管，现任MasaMaso副总经理，主抓数据挖掘分析和互联网市场营销。MasaMaso的目标是：同等质量，价格最低；同等价格，质量最好。他们把控制服装的质量视为首要问题。孙弘认为，决定一件服装的好与坏有两个因素：一是面料质量，二是加工水平。在面料的选择上，除了少部分在国外采购外，MasaMaso绝大部分使用的是国内质量上乘的雅戈尔和山东鲁泰的面料。在加工方面，孙弘动用资源，不仅找到原来为威可多代工的加工厂，还让香港溢达这样顶尖的加工厂为其生产衬衣。“虽然我们现在的量比较小，但是凭借以前的关系，这些加工厂愿意给我们生产。他们的技术高，残次品率极低，给我们的质量提供了保证。”MasaMaso的员工从产品的工艺设计环节开始，对打样、生产、检验各个环节进行跟踪、监测，在收货时对每件衣服逐一检验。对品质的控制使得MasaMaso的运营成本和产品价格比竞争对手高出不少。以衬衣为例，MasaMaso的售价在200～400元之间，凡客则在200元左右。但和传统服装企业相比，MasaMaso的价格优势则十分明显。以在MasaMaso最畅销的“莫代尔”内裤为例，该产品在迪奥、CK等品牌中是260多的价格，在英国百富是200多的价格，而在MasaMaso只有49.5元。“我们不追求多便宜，只要比你在线下买同质量产品便宜一些就可以了。”孙弘说，“我们不进商场，减少店面投资，通过直销，大大降低流通成本。相比于传统服装企业，MasaMaso赚取的是渠道这部分费用。”服装店设计与质量同等重要。孙弘请来西班牙的设计师为其品牌设计服装，并效仿全球排名第三的服装零售商、西班牙著名服装品牌ZARA的做法，让设计师经常穿梭于各种时装发布会或者出入各种时尚场所，设计一些与顶级品牌的最新产品类似的时装，从而保证MasaMaso紧跟时尚潮流。不过，孙弘真正仰慕的是ZARA供应链管理的理念和水平。“我们的量还很小，对加工厂的控制力还有限，因此暂时还学不来ZARA模式，但是我们可以根据销售数据进行市场预判。”张树略说。目前，MasaMaso对下一月的销售预测准确率平均达到90%以上，产销比能控制在80%～90%。当然，做网络直销必然要利用互联网独有的优势——数据分析。这种分析不仅有助于企业解读消费者的购买行为，还能为消费者提供更好的购买体验。正如亚马逊针对不同用户推荐不同的书籍一样，MasaMaso利用此技术进行服装推荐。“有的人喜欢穿帽衫，有的人喜欢穿衬衣，每个人的倾向不同。我们会根据他们以往的购买习惯进行新品服饰推荐。”张树略说。此外，这种分析还可以根据客户购买数据进行服饰搭配的推荐，这样，不太会穿衣服的男同胞们就可以足不出户自己购买服装了。不过，这项技术并非一蹴而就，而是建立在计算机平台建设和大规模消费数据积累的基础上的。卓越网前副总裁刘俊介绍，亚马逊在美国有一百多台服务器和几位数学家专门做一件事，就是数据挖掘和分析。可见，数据分析对电子商务的作用何其强大。	孙弘,李亮,丁晓磊,刘俊,张树略	正向	"MasaMaso: Online ""Men's Dress"" Document| Reporter Ding Xiaolei, our magazine ""We are a clothing company."" Sun Hong, the general manager of MasaMaso, Beijing Jiuhe Shangpin Technology Co., Ltd., repeatedly stressed. Many enterprises that do clothing business on the Internet prefer to say that they are IT companies, talking about how network tools can make product prices so low as to make people gasp. Sun Hong is obsessed with being a simple clothing company. ""Customers will buy cheap clothes through various channels, but they will not give up their requirements for product quality and design. MasaMaso is not only about price, but also about catching the essence of clothing."" Sun Hong said. In the past two years, the story of PPG, a pioneer of online shirt direct sales, has encouraged many well-known clothing companies and Internet people to try their best to invest in the industry of online clothing direct sales. PPG's low price bundling strategy has become a common approach in the industry, that is, the product goes to the medium and low price level, ""68 yuan each"", ""only 29 yuan for three or more"", and consumers feel ""even if the product is not good, it will not lose much if you buy it once"". This sales method once let PPG deliver more than 10000 pieces per day. This prosperity is based on low cost, low quality and high advertising investment, but it is hard to sustain. At the end of 2008, it was rumored that Li Liang, the founder of PPG, had fled with money, and the online clothing direct sales industry was shrouded in night. MasaMaso is gradually brightening in the night. Since its official launch in August 2008, the company has reached a balance between profits and losses, or even slightly profitable. It processes thousands of orders every month, the single price increases from 157 yuan at the beginning to an average of 500 yuan, and it has accumulated more than 20000 registered users (almost all of them have purchased). From the beginning of MasaMaso's creation, Sun Hong paid great attention to the team members' experience in the traditional industry. He believes that doing an enterprise must first grasp the essence of the industry, and it is only a form of doing e-commerce or selling in a physical store. More than half of MasaMaso's employees come from the traditional clothing industry, which is in sharp contrast with PPG and Fanke. In fact, Sun Hong himself is an old江湖in the clothing industry with more than ten years of experience. He served as an executive of Zhejiang Kailai Co., Ltd., CLEARLUCERNE and Beijing Vico Clothing Center, with rich resources in design and procurement. His entrepreneurial partner Zhang Shulue was a senior executive of Shenzhen Netstar Technology (a well-known SP in China, acquired by Sina in 2004) and is now the vice president of MasaMaso, focusing on data mining and analysis and Internet market marketing. MasaMaso's goal is: the lowest price for the same quality; The best quality at the same price. They regard controlling the quality of clothing as the primary problem. Sun Hong believes that there are two factors that determine the good and bad of a piece of clothing: one is the quality of fabric, and the other is the processing level. In terms of fabric selection, in addition to a small part purchased abroad, MasaMaso mostly uses the superior fabrics of YAGUOER and Shandong Lutai in China. In terms of processing, Sun Hong uses resources to not only find the processing factory that originally worked for Vico, but also let Hong Kong Yida, a top processing factory, produce shirts for it. ""Although our current volume is small, these processing plants are willing to produce for us based on our previous relationship. Their technology is high, the rate of defective products is extremely low, and they provide a guarantee for the quality of our products."" MasaMaso's employees start from the product process design, track and monitor each link of sample making, production and inspection, and inspect each piece of clothing one by one when receiving them. Quality control makes MasaMaso's operating costs and product prices much higher than its competitors. Taking shirts as an example, the price of MasaMaso is between 200 ~ 400 yuan, while the price of Fankel is about 200 yuan. But compared with traditional clothing enterprises, MasaMaso has obvious price advantages. Take the best-selling ""Modal"" underpants in MasaMaso as an example. The product is 260 yuan in Dior, CK and other brands, 200 yuan in Bofu, Britain, and 49.5 yuan in MasaMaso. ""We don't pursue how cheap it is. It's just cheaper than you buy the same quality products offline."" Sun Hong said, ""We do not enter the mall, reduce store investment, and greatly reduce circulation costs through direct sales. Compared with traditional clothing enterprises, MasaMaso earns the channel cost."" Clothing store design is as important as quality. Sun Hong invited Spanish designers to design clothes for his brand, and followed the practice of ZARA, the world's third largest clothing retailer and Spain's famous clothing brand, to let designers often shuttle between various fashion conferences or go to various fashion places to design fashions similar to the latest products of top brands, so as to ensure that MasaMaso keeps up with the fashion trend. However, Sun Hong really admires ZARA's concept and level of supply chain management. ""Our quantity is still very small, and our control over the processing plant is limited, so we can't learn from the ZARA model for the time being, but we can make market forecasts based on sales data."" Zhang Shulue said. At present, MasaMaso's average accuracy rate of sales forecast for the next month can reach more than 90%, and the production and sales ratio can be controlled at 80% ~ 90%. Of course, doing online direct sales must take advantage of the unique advantage of the Internet - data analysis. This analysis not only helps the enterprise to interpret the purchase behavior of consumers, but also provides better purchase experience for consumers. Just as Amazon recommends different books to different users, MasaMaso uses this technology to recommend clothes. ""Some people like to wear hoodies, some people like to wear shirts, and everyone has different tendencies. We will recommend new clothes according to their past purchase habits."" Zhang Shulue said. In addition, this analysis can also recommend clothes matching according to customer purchase data, so that male comrades who are not good at dressing can buy clothes without leaving home. However, this technology is not an immediate success, but is based on the construction of computer platforms and the accumulation of massive consumption data. Liu Jun, the former vice president of Excellence.com, introduced that Amazon has more than 100 servers and several mathematicians in the United States to do one thing, that is, data mining and analysis. It can be seen that data analysis plays a powerful role in e-commerce."
美国3月非农就业人数减少66.3万美国3月非农就业人数减少66.3万，市场预期减少64.0万，前值为减少65.1万。据彭博社调查显示，经济学家预期美国3月非农就业人数下滑66万，连续第十五个月下跌。不过早前公布的就业市场数据疲弱，3月非农就业人数下跌数量有望超过70万。同时，美国失业率可能升至8.5%，创1983年以来最高。小贴士：美国非农就业数据非农就业指数反映出制造行业和服务行业的发展及其增长，数字减少便代表企业减低生产，经济步入萧条；如数字大幅增加，显示一个健康的经济状况，理论上对汇率应当有利，并可能预示着更高的利率，则将对美元有利。非农就业指数若增加，反映出经济发展的上升，反之则下降。非农就业指数通常被认为是经济运行最同步且最准确的指标，于每个月第一个星期五公布前一个月的统计结果。就业报告通常被誉为外汇市场能够做出反应的所有经济指标中的“皇冠上的宝石”，它是市场最为敏感的月度经济指标，投资者通常能从中看到众多市场敏感的信息。		负向	"The number of non-agricultural employees in the United States in March decreased by 663000, 640000 in the market and 651000 in the previous month. Bloomberg's survey shows that economists expect the number of non-agricultural employees in the United States to decline by 660000 in March, falling for the fifteenth consecutive month. However, the earlier released employment market data was weak, and the number of non-agricultural job losses in March is expected to exceed 700000. At the same time, the unemployment rate in the United States may rise to 8.5%, the highest since 1983. Tips: The non-agricultural employment data of the United States The non-agricultural employment index reflects the development and growth of the manufacturing industry and the service industry. The reduction of the number indicates that enterprises are reducing production and the economy is entering depression; If the number increases significantly, it shows a healthy economic situation. In theory, it should be beneficial to the exchange rate and may indicate a higher interest rate, which will be beneficial to the US dollar. If the non-agricultural employment index increases, it reflects the rise of economic development, otherwise it decreases. The non-agricultural employment index is usually considered as the most synchronous and accurate indicator of economic operation, and the statistical results of the previous month are published on the first Friday of each month. The employment report is usually known as the ""jewel in the crown"" of all economic indicators that can make a reaction in the foreign exchange market. It is the most sensitive monthly economic indicator in the market, and investors can usually see a lot of market sensitive information from it."
油脂高位震荡追多须谨慎⊙上海中期邓宁宁○编辑杨刚国际农作物减产担忧情绪仍在，在美豆、BMD及原油上行突破走势的带动下，本周国内油脂继续攀升走强。笔者认为，短期油脂高位追涨须谨慎，但因油脂基本面行情好转支撑，试探性高位短空空间有限，设置好止损点位。国际市场上，在整体宏观经济环境维稳基调下，7、8月份是美豆关键生长期，天气不确定性因素支撑美豆自900美分一路飙升。小麦上涨利多溢出影响进而带动美豆冲破1000点关口后继续攀升。从国内采购的美豆1月船期看，以连盘1101油粕价位核算，利润值仍位于100-150元/吨左右。此外，拉尼娜现象拖延棕榈油产量增幅以及7月份马来西亚棕榈油出口温和增加影响，BMD基准10月上冲2600点一线。相对于外盘，国内油脂依然有小幅补涨的空间，但需外围市场及基本面的进一步好转配合。因国内油籽6、7月份进口维持高位，供给库存压力仍在。所以，7月份以来此波油脂期价上涨初期，现货市场始终处于观望状态。至7月下旬，油脂涨势得到外盘以及基本面天气有力支撑，现货行情才缓慢好转，7月下旬以来油脂现货涨幅达300元/吨左右。此外，尽管豆油受国内大豆供给充足压力影响，但在8月份中国、美国大豆生长关键期，天气因素的不确定性仍支撑豆类高位震荡。其次，中国与阿根廷贸易多次交涉未果，限制进口豆油政策继续执行。所以，后续油厂压榨产能或将提高，也预期在传统豆粕备货旺季9、10月份来临前，市场仍处于挺油售粕的心理。豆油价位由此得到有力支撑。周初菜油成交、持仓顺势大幅增加，助推期价1101突破阻力位8500点，创09/10年度新高至8630点，对豆油、棕榈油有较强的带动作用。从现货市场来看，因农民惜售，菜籽价高量少。油脂厂商除了在政策允许范围内增加进口菜籽采购量外，也积极参与期货市场上的菜油买入。近期国际菜籽减产炒作推高进口成本，厂商更青睐于买入交割菜油用于包装等加工。从菜油1009持仓看，国储仓位较重的万达期货，空头持仓1万多手，较稳定。目前，菜油1009价位在8400元/吨左右，相比国储菜油成本8500元/吨，现货菜油8600-8700元/吨，期价仍有望进一步上涨。主力1101多单长线可继续持有，可看多至9000点一线。综上，在维稳的宏观面环境下，油脂基本面缓慢好转配合期价大幅走强。技术上，油脂仍处于上升通道中。但经过近期大幅上涨后，大宗商品均有高位盘整的需求。而且随着双节备货带动需求逐渐完成，后市高位追涨须谨慎。不过，贸易商投机备货需求仍在，基本面仍给予油脂高位震荡支撑。所以，试探性高位短空空间有限，设置好止损点位。技术上，豆油1101在7800-7900点区间有盘整需求，上冲7900点后，多单减磅持有。此外，豆油1101逐渐往远月移仓，豆油1105在8000点处整理后，有望上冲8100点；棕榈油1101多单轻仓继续持有，上方压力位7078点，回调支撑位6800点；菜油1101多单继续持有，中长线关注9000点一线。短线回调支撑位8400点。	邓宁宁,杨刚	正向	As a senior translation expert, your responsibility is to translate the following Chinese text into English.

日本首相和民主党干事长收到装子弹威胁信日本首相鸠山由纪夫和执政党民主党干事长小泽一郎28日同时收到装有子弹的威胁信。日本内阁官房副长官松野赖久表示，首相办公室当天收到了一封疑似装有子弹的信，随即将这封没有打开的信交给了警方。警方在使用X光进行扫描后证实说，信里确实装有一枚子弹。此外，警方还发现信封里有一张写着“死”的纸条。东京警方表示，执政党民主党干事长小泽一郎的办公室当天也收到了一封装有子弹的威胁信。小泽一郎的秘书于当天下午5点半左右在新乡里发现了这封含有子弹的威胁信，并报告了警察。除了子弹外，这封信内还附有一张卡片，警方称，寄信者在卡片上要求小泽一郎辞职。目前还不清楚这些威胁信是由何人寄出。有关官员猜测，子弹威胁信针对的主要目标可能是小泽。在鸠山政府去年9月上台后，小泽一郎的办公室和住所、民主党总部以及日本朝日电视台都曾收到过抨击小泽的子弹信。目前鸠山和小泽均身陷政治献金丑闻。而鸠山为小泽辩护，引起了日本在野党和公众的不满。（马晶）	鸠山,鸠山由纪夫,松野赖久,小泽,小泽一郎,马晶	负向	"The Japanese Prime Minister and the Secretary General of the Democratic Party received a threatening letter with bullets. Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama Yukio and Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of the ruling Democratic Party, received a threatening letter with bullets on the 28th. Matsuno Laijiu, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said that the Prime Minister's Office received a letter that day that was suspected to contain a bullet, and then handed the unopened letter to the police. The police confirmed that the letter did contain a bullet after using X-rays for scanning. In addition, the police found an envelope with a note saying ""death"". The police in Tokyo said that Ichiro Ozawa, the Secretary General of the ruling Democratic Party, also received a threatening letter containing a bullet on the same day. Ichiro Ozawa's secretary found the threatening letter containing bullets in Xiangxiang at around 5:30 p.m. and reported it to the police. In addition to the bullet, the letter also attached a card, and the police said that the sender asked Ichiro Ozawa to resign on the card. It is not clear who sent these threatening letters. Officials speculate that the main target of the bullet threat letter may be Ozawa. After Hatoyama's government came to power in September last year, Ichiro Ozawa's office and residence, the headquarters of the Democratic Party and the Japanese Asahi TV station all received bullet letters criticizing Ozawa. At present, both Hatoyama and Ozawa are trapped in the political donation scandal. And Hatoyama's defense of Ozawa has caused dissatisfaction among the Japanese opposition and the public. (Ma Jing)"
传金德因降级选择退出副总否认国脚微博流露退意新浪体育讯　中超大幕落下，重庆和长沙黯然降级，这也给他们的前景蒙上了一层阴影。在金德降级后，曾有记者现场询问是否还会继续搞足球，当时俱乐部高层并没有给出准确的答复。今天，有消息透露金德集团将退出足球圈，长沙金德也将解散。不过，金德副总宗杰在接受记者采访时表示还并没有确定是否退出，金德球员也表示不知情。在将主场迁到长沙以后，金德的表现始终不尽如人意，在长沙也并没有太好的球迷市场，球队糟糕的战绩更是提不起当地球迷的兴趣。今年湖南湘涛成功冲甲，这弥补了湖南足球在职业联赛的空缺，而且湘涛也得到了湖南体育局领导的支持，金德的位置更为尴尬。就在这种情况下，金德又惨遭降级，必然会失去更多的市场。在这种情况下，金德将要解散的消息传出也并非意外。据记者了解，目前金德俱乐部还没有确定是否要退出，即便是退出，以什么样的形式退出也还没有确定。副总宗杰在接受记者采访时表示：“现在一切都没有定，说确定解散的消息都是假的。”之后，记者又电话联系了金德的几名球员，他们都表示现在都并不知情。不过，金德球员也都透露，俱乐部并没有明确下次集中的时间。值得注意的是，金德队长，现役国脚汪强今天更新了新浪微博(http://t.sina.com.cn)，也多少透露出了离别的伤感。在微博中，汪强首先说到：“顺其自然吧。”之后，他又发微博说：“明年的我会在哪里踢球呢。”流露出了一种离别的情绪。最新的一条微博中，汪强直言：“看到队友一个个走了，我的心理有种说不出来的难受，或许这一别不知道什么时候能在见面。希望我的队友们能够有个美好的未来，尤其刚上队的小孩们。越来越想家了。”(asenna)	汪强,宗杰	负向	"Chuan Jinde chose to withdraw from the vice president to deny the international football microblog to reveal the Sina Sports News Super League, Chongqing and Changsha were demoted, which also cast a shadow over their prospects. After Jinde was demoted, a journalist asked on the spot whether he would continue to play football. At that time, the club management did not give an accurate answer. Today, it was revealed that Jinde Group will quit the football circle, and Changsha Jinde will also be dissolved. However, Zong Jie, Vice President of Jinde, said in an interview with reporters that it was not yet clear whether to withdraw or not, and Jinde players also said they did not know. After moving the home stadium to Changsha, Jinde's performance has always been unsatisfactory, and there is no good fan market in Changsha. The team's poor performance is even more uninteresting to local fans. This year, Hunan Xiang Tao successfully rushed to the top of the league, which made up for the vacancy of Hunan football in the professional league, and Xiang Tao also won the support of the leaders of Hunan Sports Bureau, which made Jinde's position more embarrassing. In this case, Jinde has been demoted again, which will inevitably lose more markets. In this case, it is no surprise that the news that Jinde is going to dissolve. According to the reporter's understanding, Jinde Club has not yet decided whether to withdraw or not, and even if it withdraws, the form of withdrawal has not been determined. Vice President Zong Jie said in an interview with reporters: ""There is nothing set now, and the news that has been confirmed to dissolve is false."" Later, the reporter called several players of Jinde, and they all said that they were not aware of it now. However, Jinde players also revealed that the club did not specify the time for the next gathering. It is worth noting that Jinde's captain, the serving international football player Wang Qiang, updated Sina Weibo (http://t.sina.com.cn) today, and also revealed some sadness of separation. In the microblog, Wang Qiang first said: ""Go with the flow."" Later, he tweeted, ""Where will I play football next year?"" It shows a kind of feeling of leaving. In the latest microblog, Wang Qiang直言: ""Seeing my teammates leave one by one, I have a kind of unspeakable pain in my heart. I don't know when I can meet again. I hope my teammates can have a better future, especially the children who have just joined the team. I miss home more and more."" (asenna)"
证监会批准上期所开展线材和螺纹钢期货交易为贯彻落实《国务院办公厅关于当前金融促进经济发展的若干意见》关于“尽快推出适应国民经济发展需要的钢材等商品期货新品种”的重要战略部署，近日中国证监会批准上海期货交易所（以下简称上期所）开展线材和螺纹钢期货交易。按照《期货交易管理条例》和《期货交易所管理办法》的相关规定，在各项准备工作就绪和相关程序履行完毕后，中国证监会将尽快批准上期所挂牌其期货合约。钢铁是重要的工业原材料，被称为工业的“骨骼”。钢铁工业是国民经济重要的支柱产业，是国民经济社会发展水平和综合实力的重要标志。1996年，我国钢产量首次突破1亿吨，成为世界钢产量最大的国家，并在此后一直位居世界首位。2007年，我国钢产量4.89亿吨，占全球总产量的36.4%，超过了钢产量排名第二至第八位国家的总和。而且，我国从2006年开始成为世界上最大的钢材出口国，2007年共出口6264万吨，在国际市场占有重要地位。1993年，我国钢材价格全面放开，价格完全由市场决定。一直以来，钢材价格波动较大，市场风险较为明显。钢材生产、贸易和消费企业缺乏权威的价格信号来指导生产和经营，也无法规避价格波动的风险。本次国际金融危机中，相关行业企业运用铜、铝等有色金属期货交易在应对价格剧烈波动风险方面发挥了积极作用，钢材现货企业利用钢材期货市场来发现价格并进行套期保值的需求也日益强烈。开展钢材期货交易，一是有助于形成钢材现货与期货有机结合的市场体系，规范和完善钢材流通市场；二是逐步优化钢材价格形成机制，指导钢铁上下游企业合理安排生产和经营，帮助政府部门及时、准确地把握市场变化趋势，及早采取调控措施，保障资源的合理配置和市场的供求平衡；三是为钢铁生产、贸易和消费企业提供低成本、高效率的风险控制手段，提高企业管理水平，增强市场竞争力，推动钢铁行业的稳步发展；四是通过品牌注册的方式，吸引和鼓励规模领先、技术先进、环保达标的钢铁企业将产品注册为交割品种，促进钢铁工业健康有序发展，切实贯彻落实《钢铁产业发展政策》；五是依靠钢铁出口大国的优势，增强我国在钢材贸易中的定价影响力，提高我国钢铁工业的国际竞争力。总之，通过钢材期货交易市场的建立，使其经济功能逐步发挥，为国民经济增长提供服务。钢材分类多样，规模复杂，品种繁多。经过认真研究和深入调研，根据现货市场的实际情况和期货合约设计的技术要求，线材和螺纹钢作为钢材期货合约的交易标的较为合理。目前，上期所已经完成了线材和螺纹钢期货合约的前期设计工作，确定了通用性强、流通量大的合约标的，拟定了较为严格的交易、结算和交割制度，论证了梯度保证金制度、涨跌停板制度、持仓限额制度等风险控制措施。中国证监会将在市场风险可控、可测、可承受的前提下，按照相关法律法规的规定批准上期所尽早挂牌钢材期货合约，并指导和督促上期所根据市场发展情况，认真做好钢材期货的培育工作，逐步完善钢材期货品种体系。相关报道：合约草案曝光钢材期货行进中钢材期货打响产品创新第一炮钢材期货叩门钢铁股涨停迎新钢材期货推动钢铁企业市场化进程钢材期货的推出对钢铁行业影响深远国内外钢材期货资料介绍钢材期货历史回顾		正向	"The CSRC has approved the SFE to carry out wire and rebar futures trading.

The steel industry is an important pillar industry of the national economy, and an important symbol of the national economic development level and comprehensive strength. In 1996, my country's steel output exceeded 100 million tons for the first time, becoming the country with the largest steel output in the world, and has been ranked first in the world since then. In 2007, China's steel output was 489 million tons, accounting for 36.4% of the total global output, exceeding the total of the second to eighth largest steel producers in the world. Moreover, since 2006, China has become the world's largest steel exporter. In 2007, a total of 62.64 million tons were exported, occupying an important position in the international market. In 1993, the price of steel in our country was fully liberalized, and the price was completely determined by the market. For a long time, the fluctuation of steel price has been large, and the market risk is obvious. Steel production, trade and consumption enterprises lack authoritative price signals to guide production and operations, and they cannot avoid the risk of price fluctuations. In this international financial crisis, relevant industry enterprises have played a positive role in coping with the risk of sharp price fluctuations by using nonferrous metal futures such as copper and aluminum. Spot steel enterprises also have an increasing demand to use the steel futures market to find prices and hedge.

科比自作孽毁四大里程碑一素质他差乔丹太远太远新浪体育讯　北京时间4月23日，洛杉矶湖人客场96-101不敌俄克拉荷马雷霆，两队总比分被扳成2-1。科比-布莱恩特得到24分8次助攻，但凯文-杜兰特更胜一筹砍下29分19个篮板，外加拉塞尔-威斯布鲁克送上的27分，雷霆迎来球队搬入俄克拉荷马城后的第一场季后赛胜利。而科比，只能独自品尝失利的苦滋味了。从湖人队史角度来说，这本是一个需要铭记的夜晚，因为科比晋升为NBA历史第五大季后赛得分手，同时紫金军队史季后赛得分王也正式易主，从杰里-韦斯特传递给了科比。但如此的里程碑时刻，却以一场窝囊的输球告终，这恐怕让飞侠不愿意去回忆。湖人领先了3节却被年轻没经验的雷霆末节翻盘，科比不仅没有扮演救世主，反而成为输球重要原因。第四节后半段湖人落后命悬一线，科比想要站出来拯救球队，却因为自己过于蛮干而让胜利溜走，毫不客气的说是科比自己搅黄了自己的队史季后赛得分王登基典礼。很有讽刺意义的一点在于，科比最近四大里程碑时刻，都以球队输球告终。成为史上最年轻的25000分先生，湖人输给骑士常规赛被对手横扫；成为湖人队史常规赛得分王，湖人93-95输给实力平平的灰熊；总得分超越雷吉-米勒，湖人输给小牛；今天成为队史季后赛得分王，湖人输给雷霆。或许是天妒英才，科比就像中了什么特殊的“魔咒”，在里程碑时刻总是不能赢球。再一再二再三出现这种情况，就能从中找到些原因了。25000分输给骑士，科比出手31次，其中下半场15中3；超越韦斯特一役，科比出手28次；超越米勒一战，科比投篮是这几场最少但也达到23次，而且第四节几乎是毫无作为；今天，科比出手29次，其中扔了11个三分。四大里程碑比赛，科比平均投篮接近28次。从这些数字上不难看出，科比在这几个里程碑意义的比赛中都偏向于单打独斗，出手次数都明显超出赛季平均值，这，也成为球队输球一个不可回避的因素。谁都知道，科比的斗志好胜心是联盟中少有，他永远力求完美的做派确实是一柄双刃剑，用不好就伤了球队。就像有些人评价的，有时候看科比的比赛，他经常是有“困难要上，没有困难制造困难也要上”，救世主情节在他心中占据了太大的份额，像今天第四节这种关键时刻往往就丢掉了冷静。不得不再次提到那个说“滥”的话题：科比和乔丹。两人有太多太多相似之处，而在联盟历史上也很难找到比飞侠更接近乔丹的人了。但最接近，并不代表科比真的已经超越或者比肩昔日飞人，湖人当家的篮球境界确实高，但其赛场心智却还难以跟乔丹相提并论，同样的胜利渴望程度，可乔丹在大部分时候的处理球能力都相比科比冷静合理的多，像这种季后赛中因为迷恋自我而葬送球队的情况在颠覆乔丹身上几乎找不到。如果科比真能把这一点也提高到当年乔丹的水准，才能真正具备跟乔丹对比的资格。(vincent)	凯文-杜兰特,杰里-韦斯特,vincent,科比,雷吉-米勒,威斯布鲁克,科比-布莱恩特,乔丹,拉塞尔-威斯布鲁克,杜兰特	负向	"Kobe Bryant ruined four major milestones. One quality of him is far too far away from Jordan Sina Sports News On April 23, Beijing time, the Los Angeles Lakers lost 96-101 away from the Oklahoma Thunder, and the total score of the two teams was evened at 2-1. Kobe Bryant scored 24 points and 8 assists, but Kevin Durant scored 29 points and 19 rebounds, plus 27 points from Russell Westbrook. The Thunder welcomed the team's first playoff victory after moving to Oklahoma City. As for Kobe, he can only taste the bitterness of defeat alone. From the perspective of the Lakers' history, it should have been a memorable night, because Kobe became the fifth largest scorer in the history of the NBA's playoffs, and the Purple Gold Army's scoring champion in the history of the playoffs officially changed from Jerry West to Kobe. But such a milestone moment ended in a frustrating defeat, which I'm afraid the Flyer is not willing to remember. The Lakers led for three quarters but were overturned in the last quarter by the young and inexperienced Thunder. Kobe didn't play the role of savior, but became the main reason for the loss. The Lakers fell behind by a thread in the second half of the fourth quarter. Kobe wanted to stand up and save the team, but he let victory slip away because he was too rude. It's not exaggerating to say that Kobe has ruined his own ceremony of becoming the king of playoff scoring in his team history. It is ironic that Kobe's recent four major milestone moments have all ended with the team's defeat. When he became the youngest 25000 point winner in history, the Lakers lost to the Cavaliers in the regular season; When he became the top scorer in the history of the Lakers' regular season, the Lakers lost to the mediocre Grizzlies 93-95; When he scored more than Reggie Miller, the Lakers lost to the Mavericks; Today, when he became the top scorer in the history of the team's playoffs, the Lakers lost to the Thunder. Perhaps God is jealous of talents. Kobe is like a special ""curse"". He always loses when he reaches the milestone moment. When this situation occurs again and again, we can find some reasons. 25000 points lost to the Cavaliers, Kobe shot 31 times, 15-3 in the second half; In the battle of surpassing West, Kobe made 28 shots; In the battle of surpassing Miller, Kobe made the least shots in these games, but he also made 23 shots, and almost did nothing in the fourth quarter; Today, Kobe made 29 shots, including 11 three points. The four milestone games, Kobe averaged nearly 28 shots. It is not difficult to see from these figures that Kobe tends to play alone in these milestone games, and the number of shots is significantly higher than the season average, which is also an inescapable factor in the team's defeat. As we all know, Kobe's fighting will is rare in the league. His pursuit of perfection is really a double-edged sword. If he doesn't use it well, he will hurt the team. As some people commented, sometimes watching Kobe's game, he often ""has difficulties and no difficulties to create difficulties"", and the savior plot takes up too much share in his heart, and he often loses his composure at this critical moment like today's fourth quarter. I have to mention again the topic of ""abuse"": Kobe and Jordan. The two have too many similarities, and it is hard to find someone closer to Jordan than the Flying Man in the league history. But the closest does not mean that Kobe has really surpassed or equaled the former flying man. The basketball realm of the Lakers' boss is indeed high, but his court mentality is far from comparable to Jordan. The same degree of victory desire, but Jordan's ball handling ability is much more calm and reasonable than Kobe's at most times. It is almost impossible to find this situation in the playoffs that sacrifices the team because of self obsession in the subversive Jordan. If Kobe can really improve this point to the level of Jordan in those years, he will truly have the qualifications to compare with Jordan. (Vincent)"
墨西哥西北部集体墓地挖出104具尸体中新网4月28日电据外电报道，墨西哥警方27日在西北部杜兰戈州首府再次在集体墓地中挖出8具不明身份的尸体，使得该市一个月来挖出的尸体总数达到104具。杜兰戈州司法部长办公室发布声明称，警方在杜兰戈市一家汽车修理车间墓坑的挖掘工作已经结束。包括27日挖出的8具尸体在内，在这个墓地中共挖出87具尸体。4月中旬，在距离这个汽车修理车间不到1英里的一个农场，警方找到17具已经腐烂的尸体。杜兰戈发现集体墓地，是一个月以来墨西哥发生的第二起类似事件。警方在东北部毗邻美国的塔毛利帕斯州发现了40个集体墓地，迄今已挖出183具尸体。报道称，自从4年前墨西哥总统卡尔德隆派出数千名安保士兵打击毒品走私犯罪以来，与贩毒有关的暴力活动已经造成3.46万人死亡。在打击毒品犯罪的行动中，发现集体墓地成为越来越常见的现象。	卡尔德隆	负向	A total of 104 bodies were dug out from a collective grave in northwest Mexico. chinanews. com, April 28- The Mexico News reported that on the 27th, the Mexican police once again dug out eight unidentified bodies in the collective grave in Durango, the capital of Northwest Durango, making the total number of bodies dug out in the city in a month reach 104. The office of the Attorney General of Durango issued a statement saying that the police had finished the excavation work of the tomb pit in a car repair workshop in Durango City.

Due to the fact that the US economy shows signs of slowing down and the Fed has not indicated a tendency to launch QE3, the U.S. stock market continues to fall slightly. After the Hong Kong stock market opened slightly lower in the morning, the恒index broke through the annual line and then expanded its decline. However, at the end of the day, led by real estate stocks, it rose rapidly, significantly narrowing the decline. Bank stocks continued to be weak. In addition to Minsheng Bank (01988. HK), which rose against the market by 1.53%, other domestic bank stocks all fell, including Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank, which fell more than 2%. Hong Kong and Silver shares performed slightly better, with Standard Chartered Group and HSBC closing slightly higher. International crude oil futures prices rose, and the NDRC said that it is hoped that a new oil product pricing mechanism will be launched within the year, which may devolve pricing power to the three major oil companies, stimulating the petrochemical sector to rise. Sinopec Guande rose 2.91%, Strait Petrochemical, Sinopec and other petrochemical companies rose more than 1%, CNOOC and PetroChina closed slightly higher. However, the aviation sector was significantly under pressure, with China Southern Airlines plummeting 4.75%, China Eastern Airlines and Air China both fell more than 2%. In view of the global expectation of economic slowdown and the fear of tightening liquidity, the recent weak market has been influenced. The恒index tested the lower limit of 22400 in the medium-term box fluctuation range today, and then received support to rebound. Although it has fallen for six consecutive days, the strong rise at the end of Thursday's trading shows that the counterattack force of the many has been strengthened. Next week, another series of macroeconomic data will come in inland China, which will have an important impact on the market, and the long short may tend to be cautious. Hong Kong shares are expected to temporarily present an opportunity for interest. Welcome to publish comments I want to comment
交警让违章司机写检查及格者可放行(图)卷面干净和语言通顺10分定性自己的违法行为30分思路清晰的改正措施30分认识违法行为的后果30分“我认识到了自己的错误，今后一定改正。”别以为你看到的是某个学生的检讨，这可是违法司机的“检查”。交警采取这样的教育方式，还有专门的打分标准，及格了，就能免予被拘留的处罚。交警表示，此举更多的是教育意义。-商报记者邢军通讯员李东亚半小时内查到7辆违法车昨日上午10时许，郑州市交警三大队民警，在郑密路黄岗寺附近进行交通整治活动。这里连接着郑石高速的入口，大货车、长途客车经常聚集，客车上下人也引来了很多拉客的机动三轮车，导致原本就繁忙的郑密路通行更不畅。民警在路口一边疏导交通，一边查处违法车辆。半个小时后，民警就查扣了7名司机的车辆，他们中4人是无证驾驶，1人驾车没带驾驶证，1人驾车逆行，1人驾车拉货但没关后车门。随后，这7名司机都被带到交警三大队春晖路事故停车场接受处理。事故车前先上堂警示课据交警郑敏军讲，按照交通法的规定，无证驾驶要被处以15日以下拘留，1500元以下罚款。如果按照这种标准，有5人面临很严厉的处罚。但事实上，交警并没有对他们采用这种简单的罚款、拘留的方式，而是重点进行批评教育。在事故停车场内，民警郑敏军将7人带到了一辆已成废铁的事故轿车旁，告诉他们：11月21日，在郑密路上，一辆东风大货车在违法超车时，从右前侧撞上这辆比亚迪F3轿车，轿车被撕裂为两半，轿车司机当场死亡。而货车司机也为自己的行为付出了惨痛的代价。“很多事故都是由我们违法驾驶导致的，眼前就是一个很惨痛的教训。”郑敏军说。“及格”可免予拘留处罚之后，民警给每个人发了一张纸，让他们看事故写“故事”，分4个部分。而且，交警还给他们宣读了打分标准，及格线为60分，及格了可免予拘留处罚。评分标准是这样定的：第一部分是卷面干净，语言通顺，10分；第二部分是给自己的违法行为定性，要全面准确，30分；第三部分是对此行为的改正措施，要思路清晰，30分；第四部分是违法行为的后果，要认识到位，30分。“我叫华廷杰，4日上午被交警查了，我没有驾驶证，违反了法律，以后一定吸取这个教训，安全驾驶。”这是华廷杰所写的“故事”的一段，小学毕业的他写得很专心。“该咋说咋说，俺确实不对，以后一定改。”司机苏建国说。“其实打分只是一种形式，主要是看他们态度如何。作为交警的一种管理手段，可以对认错态度好的司机减轻或免予处罚。”交警郑敏军说，同时，这就相当于一份保证书，如果下次再被交警查到，就要按法律来处理了。	华廷杰,郑敏军,苏建国,邢军,李东亚	正向	"Traffic police let the driver who violates the rules write a pass (picture) The paper is clean and the language is smooth. 10 points define his own illegal behavior. 30 points define the clear corrective measures. 30 points recognize the consequences of the illegal behavior. 30 points ""I realized my mistake and will correct it in the future."" Don't think that what you see is a student's self criticism. This is the ""examination"" of the illegal driver. The traffic police adopt such an educational approach, which has a special scoring standard. If you pass the exam, you will be exempt from detention. The traffic police said that this move is more educational. -邢Jun, a business reporter and a communication worker in East Asia, found seven illegal vehicles within half an hour. At about 10:00 yesterday morning, the police of Zhengzhou Traffic Police Detachment conducted a traffic rectification activity near Huang Gang Temple, Zhengmi Road. This is connected with the entrance of Zhengshi Expressway. Large trucks and long-distance buses often gather here, and many motorized tricycles that pull passengers also attract passengers, which makes the busy Zhengmi Road less passable. While the police were directing traffic at the intersection, they were also investigating and dealing with illegal vehicles. Half an hour later, the police checked and detained the vehicles of seven drivers, four of whom were driving without a license, one was driving without a driver's license, one was driving in the wrong direction, and one was driving with goods but did not close the back door. Later, the seven drivers were all taken to the Chunhui Road Accident Parking Lot of the Third Traffic Police Detachment for handling. According to Zheng Minjun, the traffic police, in front of the accident vehicle, we should first have a warning class. According to the provisions of the Traffic Law, driving without a license shall be detained for less than 15 days and fined less than 1500 yuan. If this standard is followed, five people will face severe punishment. But in fact, the traffic police did not adopt this simple way of fines and detention for them, but focused on criticism and education. In the accident parking lot, the police, Zheng Minjun, took the seven people to a scrapped accident car and told them: On November 21, on Zhengmi Road, a Dongfeng truck hit this BYD F3 car from the right front side when it was overtaking illegally, the car was torn in half, and the car driver died on the spot. The truck driver also paid a painful price for his behavior. ""Many accidents are caused by our illegal driving, and this is a very painful lesson."" said Zheng Minjun. After being ""qualified"", the police gave everyone a piece of paper and asked them to write ""story"" according to the accident, which was divided into four parts. Moreover, the traffic police also announced the scoring standards to them. The pass line is 60 points, and those who pass the examination can be exempt from detention. The scoring criteria are defined as follows: The first part is clean and fluent, 10 points; The second part is to define our own illegal acts, which should be comprehensive and accurate, 30 points; The third part is the corrective measures for this behavior, which should be clear, 30 points; The fourth part is the consequences of the illegal act, which should be recognized, 30 points. ""My name is Huatingjie. On the morning of the 4th, the traffic police checked me. I had no driver's license. I violated the law. I will learn from this lesson and drive safely in the future."" This is a paragraph of the ""story"" written by Huatingjie, who graduated from primary school and wrote very attentively. ""Say what you want, I'm really wrong, I must change later."" Said Su Jinping, the driver. ""In fact, scoring is just a form, mainly to see their attitude. As a management tool of the traffic police, drivers with good attitude of admitting mistakes can be punished less or exempted from punishment."" Zheng Minjun, the traffic police, said. At the same time, this is equivalent to a guarantee. If the driver is checked by the traffic police again next time, he will be dealt with according to the law."

瀚民看盘：资金有选择地进场上周冲高遇阻之后，为什么调整很难大幅展开？答：今年上半年的时候，市场呈现下跌盘整再下跌的态势，大家都盼着有反弹，但盘整就是反弹；7月初行情出现转机之后，盘整是不是就可以代替大幅回调，这是值得关注的。一般来说，在一个以老股民为主的市场氛围中，横盘等于就是调整。所以，目前的市场恐怕不会出现过于剧烈的调整。周一上午盘面似乎又有新的买盘进场，是否可以看着又有增量资金介入了呢？答：能够推动指数上扬，肯定是由资金介入造成的。不过，同两个星期以前相比，现在市场资金是有选择地进场，这跟前一段时间的情况是完全不同的。场外资金选择怎样的股票进入的呢？答：从最近两周的情况来看，农林牧渔以及食品饮料是资金注入比较明显的地方。除此之外，周一上海重组股又风起云涌，这说明重组题材也是近期资金介入的一条主线。总的来看，一是通胀，二是重组，这恐怕在未来一段时间都是我们关注的重点。中期市场的趋势怎样？答：7月初行情出现了拐点，经过短暂的逼空拉升之后，近期进行修复整理。由于短期市场迅速积累起了大量的获利筹码，估计这种消化整理的过程会比较长，不大可能再次出现逼空的态势。如果是这样的话，在保持对市场趋势坚定信心的同时，从操作层面上说，应当保持克制。看中的股票要坚持低吸进场的原则。郭勇斌(瀚民)已有_COUNT_条评论我要评论	瀚民,郭勇斌	正向	Hanmin's view on the market: After the funds chose to enter the market last week, they encountered resistance. Why is it hard to make substantial adjustments? Answer: In the first half of this year, the market showed a trend of falling and consolidating again, and everyone was hoping for a rebound, but consolidation was the rebound; After the market changed in early July, it is worth paying attention to whether consolidation can replace a substantial pullback. Generally speaking, in a market atmosphere dominated by old stock traders, horizontal trading is equal to adjustment. Therefore, the current market is unlikely to experience too drastic adjustments. On Monday morning, there seems to be a new buying order coming in. Can we see that there is incremental funds coming in? Answer: The intervention of funds must push the index up. However, compared with two weeks ago, the market funds now choose to enter the market, which is completely different from the situation in the previous period. What kind of stocks do the off-site funds choose to enter? Answer: From the situation in the past two weeks, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, as well as food and beverage, are the places where funds are injected more obviously. In addition, on Monday, the restructuring stocks in Shanghai were back on the rise, which shows that the theme of restructuring is also the main line of recent fund intervention. In general, inflation and restructuring are probably the focus of our attention for some time in the future. What is the trend of the medium-term market? Answer: The market turned at the beginning of July. After a short forced emptying and lifting, it has recently been repaired and sorted out. Since the short-term market has quickly accumulated a large number of profitable chips, it is estimated that the process of digestion and consolidation will be long, and it is unlikely that there will be another forced emptying trend. In this case, while maintaining firm confidence in the market trend, we should be restrained in terms of operation. The principle of insisting on low suction when entering the market should be followed for the targeted stocks. Guo Yongbin (Hanmin) has _COUNT_ comments I want to comment
货币基金将被实时监控杜绝片面追求收益和规模⊙本报记者徐婧婧昨日，中国证监会与中央国债登记结算有限责任公司签署合作监管备忘录，再次加强对货币市场基金的监管。据悉，在双方签署备忘录后，中债登将向中国证监会提供货币市场基金的交易数据，以便证监会能够实时监控货币市场基金在操作上的异常情况，从而及时监管。事实上，2008年下半年以来，货币市场基金规模出现迅猛扩张，为此，证监会曾于11月17日做出风险提示，严禁基金公司采用“长券短做”“藏券”等违规操作，杜绝片面追求收益率和基金规模的做法。天相数据统计显示，2008年末，货币市场基金占全部基金净值的比例从3.39%上升到20.63%。相较于股票市场的价格主要通过公开竞价，货币市场交易产品价格受到人为因素影响的可能性较大，此次证监会与中债登合作推出的监控系统或将解决上述难题。根据新系统，如果双方交易价格严重偏离由长期收益率曲线决定的价格区间，将被纳入预警范围，该交易产品的交易双方、转移路径都会被监测。一旦发现违反规则的操作行为，证监会将对其进行不同程度的惩罚。	徐婧婧	正向	"The monetary fund will be monitored in real time to avoid the pursuit of returns and scale. ⊙ Reporter Xu Jiejie Yesterday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Central Bond Registration and Settlement Co., Ltd. signed a cooperation supervision memorandum to further strengthen the supervision of money market funds.

In fact, since the second half of 2008, the scale of money market funds has expanded rapidly. For this reason, the CSRC made a risk warning on November 17, prohibiting fund companies from adopting illegal operations such as ""long term short term"" and ""hidden coupons"", and avoiding the practice of片面pursuing yield and fund scale. Tianxiang data statistics show that at the end of 2008, the proportion of money market funds in the net value of all funds rose from 3.39% to 20.63%. Unlike the stock market, the price of which is mainly determined by open bidding, the price of money market trading products is more likely to be affected by human factors. The monitoring system launched by the CSRC in cooperation with Zhongzhai may solve the above problems. Under the new system, if the transaction price of both sides deviates seriously from the price range determined by the long-term yield curve, it will be included in the early warning range, and both sides of the transaction products and the transfer path will be monitored. Once a violation of the rules is found, the CSRC will punish it to different degrees."
安全专家称苹果iPad存在安全问题【赛迪网讯】1月29日消息，据国外媒体报道，一位移动安全专家星期四说，苹果新的iPad平板电脑可能存在影响iPhone(手机上网)手机的同样的加密薄弱的安全问题。移动安全公司SMobileSystem的首席技术官DanielHoffman说，如果iPad使用iPhone手机相同的加密方式，包括手机号码和电子邮件地址在内的敏感的个人数据就会被人窃取和查看。Hoffman说，iPhone安全加密问题基本上是没有任何价值的。这个加密措施很容易绕过去。第二，如果iPad用户从苹果应用程序商店获得自己的应用程序，他们就有偶尔得到恶意软件的风险。他指出，苹果应用程序商店一直存在恶意软件。Hoffman说，此外，iPad还会像其它使用不安全的WiFi网络的设备一样遭到中间人攻击。SMobile正在开发一个防御这种攻击的工具。在这种攻击中，攻击者能够拦截移动设备通过WiFi网络发送的互联网通讯，同时假冒通讯中的合法的一方注入新的信息。他说，iPad还存在管理能力问题，如选择使用PIN或者口令代码、一旦丢失或者被窃之后远程锁死和删除功能等。iPhone提供帮助查找丢失的手机和远程删除数据的功能，但是，这项服务非常昂贵，每年收费100美元。苹果发言人没有对这个消息发表评论。作者：天虹	天虹, DanielHoffman	负向	Security experts say that Apple's iPad has security problems. (Saidnews) On January 29, according to foreign media reports, a mobile security expert said on Thursday that Apple's new iPad tablet computer may have the same encryption weakness and security problems as the iPhone (mobile Internet) mobile phone. Daniel Hoffman, chief technology officer of SMobileSystem, a mobile security company, said that if the iPad uses the same encryption as the iPhone, sensitive personal data including mobile phone numbers and email addresses will be stolen and viewed. Hoffman said that the iPhone security encryption problem is basically worthless. This encryption measure is very easy to bypass. Secondly, if iPad users get their own applications from the Apple App Store, they are at risk of occasionally getting malware. He pointed out that there has always been malicious software in the Apple App Store. Hoffman said that in addition, the iPad will be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack like other devices that use insecure WiFi networks. SMobile is developing a tool to defend against this attack. In this attack, the attacker can intercept the Internet communications sent by the mobile device via the WiFi network and inject new information by pretending to be a legitimate party in the communication. He said that the iPad also has management problems, such as choosing to use PIN or password code, locking and deleting functions once it is lost or stolen. The iPhone provides a function to help find a lost mobile phone and delete data remotely, but this service is very expensive, with an annual fee of $100.

金融街西单广场即将带来商务办公新体验在投资界有这么一句话“80年代看珠三角，90年代看长三角，21世纪看环渤海经济圈”。毋庸置疑，环渤海经济圈作为中国经济的第三增长极，在吸取了珠三角和长三角的经验和教训之后，城市群和经济圈的理念业已成熟，成为了中国发展最快速、最规范、最国际化的经济发展核心。在“环渤海经济圈”波澜壮阔的发展进程中，随着京津城际高速铁路的开通，规划多年的“京津一体化”已成为现实，使得北京、天津两地的各种产业得到迅速发展，吸引了世界各国顶级资源云集于此，成为中国最具发展潜力的核心所在。而“新京津”的诞生，亦促使众多嗅觉灵敏的地产大鳄纷纷北上，在“新京津”区域范围内“走马圈地”，一场轰轰烈烈的房地产开发大战在此隆重上演。古人云：善弈者，谋势，不善弈者，谋子。金融街控股集团无疑是善于“运筹帷幄”的实力房企，因为当其他房企在京津两地采取传统的“买地盖房”开发策略之际，作为国内最具城市运营理念和商业地产开发经验的金融街控股集团，却凭借将北京金融街打造成为“中国的华尔街”的深厚商业地产开发经验，以打造京津商务新地标为己任，于天津中心城区海河沿岸铸造了“华北第一高楼”津塔，在北京最具商务氛围的西单商圈缔造了金融街西单广场(论坛相册户型样板间点评地图搜索)两大地标性商务旗舰项目，成就了“双星闪耀”环渤海经济圈的非凡气势，由此上演一幕气势恢宏的商业地产开发“双城记”。作为“华北第一高楼”的津塔写字楼，高达336.9米，已于2010年1月14日正式封顶，在世界已建成的摩天大楼中排名第25位。津塔写字楼内外兼修，无论是建筑结构体系设计还是设施设备应用，都采用了国际领先技术。虽然津塔2011年才能建成入驻，但目前其已经吸引了逾50家世界500强企业前来洽谈，准备选址于此。继津塔取得令人艳羡的市场成就之后，金融街控股集团剑指北京西单商圈，在此精心打造了又一商务地标性建筑——金融街西单广场，续写全新的商务发展传奇。无可比拟的优越地理属性，是金融街西单广场领袖京城商务地产市场核心价值所在，其南接“神州第一街”长安街，东临国家政治中心中南海，西咫尺紧邻京城金融核心所在地金融街，汇集全北京各大优秀资源于一体，坐享世界级繁华成熟配套，奠定了首屈一指的商务办公氛围。同时，金融街西单广场周边聚集了长安街、西二环等城市交通主干道，并紧邻地铁一号线以及地铁4号线灵境胡同站，由此形成了快捷通达的立体交通网络系统，可迅速连接京城各大核心商圈，有利于商务活动的顺利开展。此外，对于建筑品质的精益求精，亦是金融街西单广场在竞争激烈的京城商务市场脱颖而出的又一大制胜利器。金融街西单广场特别设置了10米挑高独立大堂、独立出入口，为入驻企业营造了往来于西单繁华万象之中，静享独立办公之纯粹商务氛围。同时，其还以世界级标准，在写字楼内营造了空中生态景观休闲空间，开启绿色生态办公新潮流。而面积阔达7700平方米的标准层，则以方正规划布局、空间灵活实用、超高使用率的产品特色，满足实力企业不同的办公需求，成就顶级商务办公新体验。此外，金融街西单广场自身还配备了近5万平方米的商业设施，将以奢华购物中心、会议中心为业态规划方向，为入驻企业提供了繁华便利的商务配套。金融街西单广场的非凡品质，使其和“华北第一高楼”津塔一样，尚在建设之中却已名声在外。目前，已经有数十家实力企业意欲购买金融街西单广场作为办公所在地，其火爆的市场前景由此可见一斑。我要评论房产导航：		正向	"The Financial Street Xidan Square in the Financial Street is going to bring a new experience of office work. There is a saying in the investment industry that ""in the 1980s, we looked at the Pearl River Delta, in the 1990s, we looked at the Yangtze River Delta, and in the 21st century, we looked at the Bohai Rim Economic Circle"". There is no doubt that as the third growth pole of China's economy, the Bohai Rim Economic Circle has matured the concept of urban agglomerations and economic circles after learning from the experience and lessons of the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta, and has become the core of China's most rapid, standardized and international economic development. In the grand development process of the ""Bohai Rim Economic Circle"", with the opening of the Tianjin Beijing Intercity High Speed Railway, the planned ""Beijing Tianjin Integration"" has become a reality, which has made various industries in Beijing and Tianjin develop rapidly, attracted top resources from all over the world to gather here, and become the core of China's most potential development. The birth of ""New Beijing Tianjin"" also prompted many real estate tycoons with keen sense of smell to go north, ""circle land"" in the ""New Beijing Tianjin"" area, and an ambitious real estate development war was staged here. As the old saying goes: Good chess players, strategists, and bad chess players, strategists. Financial Street Investment Holding Group is undoubtedly a powerful real estate enterprise that is good at ""maneuvering and commanding"", because when other real estate enterprises adopt the traditional ""land purchase and housing construction"" development strategy in Beijing and Tianjin, as the financial street investment holding group with the most urban operation concept and commercial real estate development experience in China, it has relied on the deep commercial real estate development experience of building Beijing Financial Street into ""China's Wall Street"", and has made it its mission to create a new landmark for business in Beijing and Tianjin. It has cast the ""North China's First Skyscraper"" Jin Tower in the central urban area of Tianjin along the Haihe River, and has created two landmark business flagship projects of Financial Street Xidan Square (picture album model room review map search) in Xidan business district, the most business atmosphere in Beijing, which has achieved the extraordinary momentum of ""Bingang Economic Circle"" with ""Doubles Star Shining"", and has launched a grand commercial real estate development ""Tales of Two Cities"". As the ""first tallest building in North China"", the Jin Tower office building, 336.9 meters high, officially topped out on January 14, 2010, ranking 25th among the world's skyscrapers that have been built. The Jin Tower office building is well equipped with both internal and external structures. Both the architectural structure system design and the facility equipment application adopt international leading technologies. Although Jin Tower can only be completed and moved in 2011, it has attracted more than 50 world top 500 enterprises to come here for negotiation. After Jin Tower achieved enviable market success, Financial Street Investment Holding Group pointed to Xidan Business District in Beijing and carefully created another landmark business building - Financial Street Xidan Square, which continued to write a new business development legend. The incomparable geographical superiority is the core value of the Financial Street Xidan Square in the business real estate market of the capital city. Its south connects the ""China's First Street"" Chang'an Street, the east is close to the national political center Zhongnanhai, and the west is close to the financial street, the core of the capital's financial sector, which integrates all major excellent resources in Beijing, enjoys world-class prosperous and mature supporting facilities, and lays the foundation for the first-class business office atmosphere. At the same time, the Financial Street Xidan Square is surrounded by the main urban traffic arteries such as Chang'an Street and West Second Ring Road, and is close to the Lingjing Hutong Station of Metro Line 1 and Metro Line 4, forming a quick and accessible three-dimensional transportation network system, which can quickly connect major core business districts in the capital, and is conducive to the smooth development of business activities. In addition, the continuous improvement of building quality is another major victory for the Financial Street Xidan Square to stand out in the fierce business market of the capital. Financial Street Xidan Square has set up a 10 meter high independent lobby and an independent entrance and exit, creating a pure business atmosphere of independent office in the midst of the prosperity of Xidan. At the same time, it also created an ecological landscape leisure space in the office building to open up a new trend of green ecological office. The standard floor with an area of up to 7700 square meters meets the different office needs of enterprises with the product characteristics of square planning layout, flexible and practical space and ultra-high utilization rate, achieving a new experience of top business office. In addition, the Financial Street Xidan Square itself is also equipped with nearly 50000 square meters of commercial facilities, which will provide the enterprises with a prosperous and convenient business supporting facilities with the business planning orientation of luxury shopping centers and conference centers. The extraordinary quality of Financial Street Xidan Square, like the ""North China's First Skyscraper"" Jin Tower, has made it famous even though it is still under construction. At present, dozens of powerful enterprises have intended to purchase the Financial Street Xidan Square as their office location, which shows that its火爆market prospects.

In addition, CITIC Pacific has no further information to disclose. Yesterday, some Hong Kong media quoted sources as saying that the Hong Kong police's Commercial Crime Investigation Department is investigating CITIC Pacific's Australian dollar foreign exchange contract, hoping to find out the reason why the company delayed disclosing the huge foreign exchange loss of 1.55 billion Hong Kong dollars for six weeks.

Previously, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission has launched an investigation on this matter, but has not disclosed the investigation results.

中国田径最古老纪录由谁刷新17岁新星引爆冲击潮新浪体育讯　09室外赛季刚刚拉开序幕，国内田径界就传出喜讯，在广西玉林举行的全运会田径男子预选赛暨全国田径锦标赛，来自河北的17岁小将曹硕跳出17米13的惊人成绩，打破了该年龄段的世界纪录。曹硕的横空出世，使国内田径界冲击宿将邹振先保持了28岁之久的“胡子纪录”增添一丝信心。翻开中国田径全国纪录表可以发现，邹振先保持的17米34的男子三级跳远全国纪录是所有纪录中时间最长的。1981年世界杯田径赛上，邹振先以17米34的佳绩夺得一枚宝贵的银牌，这一成绩仅比金牌得主巴西名将奥利维拉少3厘米，在当年排名榜中高居第二位。其实，那次比赛邹振先跳出的实际远度不止17米34，而是17米50上下，可惜由于他穿了宽裤腿的尼龙短裤，身子还未落地，裤腿却轻轻擦着了沙坑，使成绩下降了10多厘米。邹振先的短裤为何不合身？原来世界杯田径赛不是以国家名义参赛的，而是以各大洲为参赛单位，邹振先当时身披的亚洲队战袍，并不是由国内提供的，因此衣裤尺寸出现了偏差。1981年堪称邹振先的鼎峰时期，那一年他先后以17米32、17米34两次打破亚洲纪录，前一次佳绩使他夺得世界大学生运动会冠军。随着年龄的增大，此后几年邹振先很少跳过17米大关。他自己肯定也没想到，“17米34”在全国纪录表沉睡时间超过了1/4世纪。上世纪八十年代末，陈燕平、邹四新两位新秀的涌现，使中国男子三级跳远到达了又一个高峰期。1990年在北京举行的第11届亚运会，陈燕平、邹四新两人共同演绎了亚洲三级跳远有史以来最精彩的一场角逐，邹四新跳出17米31的近九年亚洲最好成绩，距离邹振先纪录只有三厘米差距。不过，这一成绩仍没有使他登上冠军宝座，因为陈燕平跳出了惊人的17米51。可惜陈燕平完成那一跳时风速超过2米/秒的国际标准，这一成绩虽让他尝到亚运会金牌的滋味，却无法在亚洲纪录表中占据一席之地。此后几年后，随着陈燕平、邹四新走过鼎峰期，国内三级跳远整体水平明显下降，上世纪九十年代间只有曾立志跳出接近邹振先纪录的成绩——17米30。看到自己的成绩在全国纪录表岿然不动，邹振先难免心急。1997年，“邹振先三级跳远纪录挑战赛”应运而生，这项比赛目前已举办了九届。虽然号称挑战，但前七届比赛冠军成绩都没有17米大关。近两年情况明显好转，2007年举行的第八届挑战赛，年仅20岁的山东小将钟敏维以17米27的夺冠，创造了近12年来国内最好成绩。另外亚军得主湖南选手吴波也突破17米大关。去年举行的第9届比赛，吴波以17米02的成绩夺冠。其实，近几年国内涌现出的好手远不止钟敏维、吴波两人。2001年九运会，河北队选手吴冀以17.04米的成绩夺冠，这是中国选手时隔多年之后闯过17米大关。2004年起，国内涌现出一批20岁左右的小将，他们相继突破17米大关：2004年5月，河北选手李延熙在全国锦标赛暨奥运会选拔赛上，以17米09的佳绩，使自己成为国内第一位跨进17米大关的80后选手。四个月后，四川新秀顾俊杰在全国冠军赛上跳出17米23米的成绩；05赛季，李延熙将个人最好成绩提高至17米15；2006年，李延熙虽然没有创造个人最好成绩，但全年三次跃过17米大关，显示出不俗实力。这一年，“17米俱乐部”多了一位成员——浙江选手朱书靖，其成绩为17米03；07赛季是一个令人振奋的年度，该年有四人突破17米大关，分别是钟敏维、顾俊杰、吴波和朱书靖，其中钟敏维17米27的成绩在世界众选手中居第15位，相当于雅典奥运会第5名，这是中国男子三级跳远选手近10多来相当难得的战绩。目前，国内有5名现役选手最好成绩超过了17米大关，这一现象前所未有。然而，中国选手普遍存在着水平波动大的弱点，这一软肋在一定程度上制约着他们技术水平的正常发挥。如，顾俊杰04年跳出17米23的成绩，05赛季他的最好成绩仅有16米44，相差近80厘米。北京奥运会顾俊杰的表现令人大失所望，成绩仅有15米94；再如，07年令人惊喜的小将钟敏维，已有近两年时间未攻克17米大关，北京奥运会他的最好成绩仅15米59；众将中，李延熙以技术见长，成绩也最为稳定，04年至08年他有四个赛季跳过17米门槛。即便是这位技术型选手，在北京奥运会也显露出技术稳定方面的欠缺。预赛时，李延熙跳出17米30的佳绩，这一成绩是1990年后国内最好成绩之一，在奥运会预赛阶段排在众选手第三位。两天后的决赛，李延熙的表现明显不及预赛阶段，第一跳成绩仅有15米93，后两跳虽有好转，但状态出得明显偏晚，16米77的三跳最好成绩使他距离前八名仅有10厘米这米，痛失前八名的角逐。如果李延熙能达到预赛时的水平，将取得第五名的佳绩，这也是邹振先在1984年洛杉矶奥运会上取得的名次。曹硕的涌现，使挑战“邹振先纪录军团”增添一位生力军。值得一提的是，目前国内众好手均处于运动生涯的黄金时期，年龄最大的李延熙、吴波也只有25岁，国人有理由相信他们完全具备冲破三级跳远的“胡子纪录”的能力。当然，在超越“邹振先纪录”的同时，众好手还要在技术稳定性方面多下功夫，要像邹振先那样在国内外比赛持续表现出高水平比赛能力，这样中国三级跳远才会迎来一个真正的第二春。附：近五年国内“17米俱乐部”成员一览表2004年：顾俊杰(19岁，四川)17米23李延熙(20岁，河北)17米092005年：李延熙17米152006年：李延熙17米12朱书靖(21岁，浙江)17米032007年：钟敏维(20岁，山东)17米27顾俊杰17米11吴波(23岁，湖南)17米03朱书靖17米012008年：李延熙17米30吴波17米102009年：曹硕(17岁，河北)17米13(暂居今年世界排名第13位，仅有5人超越他)吴波17米06(王全立)	邹振先,奥利维拉,吴波,曹硕,朱书靖,吴冀,陈燕平,顾俊杰,李延熙,钟敏维	正向	"Who is the oldest record of Chinese athletics? The 17 year old new star引爆冲击新浪Sports News The 09 outdoor season has just opened, and there is good news in the domestic athletics industry. At the men's pre selection event of the National Games and the National Athletics Championships held in Yulin, Guangxi, Cao Shuo, a 17 year old young man from Hebei Province, jumped out of the amazing result of 17m13, breaking the world record of the age group. Cao Shuo's sudden rise has added a bit of confidence to the domestic athletics industry's impact on the old guard Belo Horizonte, which has maintained the ""beard record"" for 28 years. Looking at the table of national records in Chinese athletics, we can find that the national record of 17m34 men's triple jump kept by Belo Horizonte is the longest of all records. At the 1981 World Cup Athletics Championships, Belo Horizonte won a valuable silver medal with a good score of 17m34. This score was only 3cm less than Oliveira, a famous Brazilian gold medal winner, and ranked second in the ranking list of that year. In fact, Belo Horizonte jumped far more than 17m34 in that game, but it was around 17m50. Unfortunately, his trouser legs were gently rubbing against the sand pit before he landed, because he wore nylon shorts with wide trouser legs, which reduced his score by more than 10cm. Why are Belo Horizonte's shorts not fit? Originally, the World Cup Athletics Championships did not compete in the name of the country, but in the name of continents as the participating unit, the Asian team cloak worn by Belo Horizonte at that time was not provided by the domestic side, so the size of clothes and trousers deviated. 1981 can be regarded as the peak period of Belo Horizonte. In that year, he broke the Asian record twice with 17 meters 32 and 17 meters 34 respectively. The first good result made him win the championship of the World University Games. With the increase of age, Belo Horizonte rarely jumped over the 17 meter mark in the following years. I'm sure he didn't expect that ""17m34"" had slept for more than a quarter of a century in the national record table. At the end of the 1980s, the emergence of two promising young people, Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin, made China's men's triple jump reach another peak. The 11th Asian Games held in Beijing in 1990 saw Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin jointly demonstrate the most exciting game in the history of Asian triple jump. Zou Sixin jumped 17m31, nearly nine years' best result in Asia, only three centimeters away from Zou Zhenxian's record. However, this achievement did not make him ascend to the championship throne, because Chen Yanping jumped an amazing 17m51. Unfortunately, when Chen Yanping completed that jump, the wind speed exceeded the international standard of 2m/s. Although this achievement let him taste the gold medal of the Asian Games, he could not occupy a seat in the Asian record table. In the following few years, with Chen Yanping and Zou Sixin going through their peak period, the overall level of domestic triple jump dropped significantly. In the 1990s, only Zeng Lizhi jumped close to the record of Zou Zhenxian - 17 m 30. Seeing that his achievements remained unchanged in the national record table, Belo Horizonte could not help worrying. In 1997, the ""Belo Horizonte Triple Jump Record Challenge"" came into being, and this competition has been held for nine sessions. Although it is called a challenge, the champions of the first seven competitions did not have the 17 meter pass. The situation has improved significantly in the past two years. The eighth challenge held in 2007, Zhong Minwei, a 20 year old young man from Shandong Province, won the championship with a score of 17m27, creating the best result in the country in nearly 12 years. The runner up, Hunan athlete Wu Bo, also broke the 17 meter mark. At the 9th competition held last year, Wu Bo won the championship with a score of 17m02. In fact, the number of good players who have emerged in recent years is far more than Zhong Minwei and Wu Bo. At the 2001 Ninth National Games, Hebei team player Wu Jijun won the championship with a score of 17.04m, which was the first time that Chinese athletes had broken the 17 meter mark for many years. Since 2004, a group of young players around 20 years old have emerged at home, and they have successively broken through the 17 meter mark: in May 2004, Li Yanzhixi, a Hebei player, jumped 17m09 at the National Championships and the Olympic selection competition, making him the first 80s player in China to cross the 17 meter mark. Four months later, Gu Junjie, a new star in Sichuan, jumped 17m23 at the National Championships; In the 05 season, Li Yanzhixi improved his personal best to 17m15; In 2006, although Li Yanzhixi did not create his personal best, he jumped over the 17 meter mark three times throughout the year, showing his excellent strength. This year, the ""17 meter club"" has another member - Zhu Shujing, a Zhejiang player, with a score of 17m03; The 07 season is an exciting year. Four people broke through the 17 meter mark this year, namely Zhong Minwei, Gu Junjie, Wu Bo and Zhu Shujing, among whom Zhong Minwei's score of 17m27 ranked 15th among the world's top players, equivalent to the fifth place in the Athens Olympic Games, which is a rare achievement for Chinese male triple jump players in the past decade. At present, there are five serving players in China whose best results have exceeded the 17 meter mark, which is unprecedented. However, Chinese athletes generally have the weakness of big level fluctuations, which restricts their normal technical performance to a certain extent. For example, Gu Junjie jumped 17m23 in 04 and his best score was only 16m44 in the 05 season, nearly 80cm apart. Gu Junjie's performance at the Beijing Olympic Games was very disappointing, with a score of only 15m94; For example, the surprising young player Zhong Minwei, who has not been able to break through the 17 meter mark for nearly two years, achieved the best score of 15m59 in the Beijing Olympic Games; Among the generals, Li Yanzhixi is good at technology and the most stable in performance. From 04 to 08, he jumped over the 17 meter threshold for four seasons. Even this technical player also showed a lack of technical stability in the Beijing Olympic Games. In the preliminary competition, Li Yanzhixi jumped an excellent result of 17m30, which was one of the best results in China after 1990, and ranked third among the participants in the Olympic preliminary competition. Two days later in the final, Li Yanzhixi's performance was significantly worse than that in the preliminary stage. The first jump was only 15m93. Although the latter two jumps improved, they showed up late. His best score of 16m77 for three jumps was only 10 centimeters from the top eight, and he lost the competition for the top eight. If Li Yanzhixi can reach the level of the preliminary competition, he will achieve the fifth place, which is the ranking of Zou Zhenxu at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. The emergence of Cao Shuo has added a new force to the challenge of ""Belo Horizonte Record Corps"". It is worth mentioning that at present, all the promising young people at home are in the golden period of their sports career. The oldest Li Yanzhixi and Wu Bo are only 25 years old. The Chinese people have reason to believe that they are fully capable of breaking the ""beard record"" of the triple jump. Of course, while surpassing the ""Belo Horizonte record"", the public must also do more in terms of technical stability, and continue to show high-level competition ability at home and abroad like Belo Horizonte. Only then will China's triple jump usher in a real second spring.

Recently, it was reported that they were going to have a good time. Even Leung Songde, the record producer, urged them to get married as soon as possible, and said that the baby they were going to have would definitely be very beautiful. Deng Lixin did not resist, but thanked Leung Songde with a smile, as if he had agreed to the love affair by default. Yesterday, Deng Lixin, together with a group of local football stars including Chen Zhaoqi, Chen Weihao and Guo Jianbang, went to Mong Kok to host the opening ceremony of a World Cup event held in a shopping mall. They also wore giant cartoon battle boots to try out ""thrush shooting"", but the ""coquettish"" Deng Lixin had a pose but no reality, and it was just a facade. Deng Lixin said that she has been watching the World Cup since childhood, but she has never tried to enjoy the game on the spot. She has always been holding Argentina. When asked if her rumored boyfriend Fang Lishen likes to watch football, she said: ""Sure, boys like to watch football."" As for the sudden news of marriage, Deng Lixin smiled and pointed out that after seeing the report, a friend immediately called the hotel to ask, and after learning that the hotel could only serve more than a dozen banquets, he was sure that the report was not reliable, because a dozen tables were not enough. Ask her how many rounds she is going to have? She laughed and said: ""I haven't thought about it. I haven't planned for things that are too far away."" Fang Lishen recently exposed that he was under pressure from his mother to have children.

Since he knew that he had been punished by the Football Association, Murich has been in a very bad mood, and the Brazilian is now very regretful for the impact he has caused to the team. Speaking of the punishment he received, Murich said: I think the punishment of the Football Association is very unfair, but I can still accept and obey it. On the 16th, Murich was punished by Guangzhou Evergrande Club and the Chinese Football Association respectively, which immediately plunged the usually cheerful Brazilian into distress. In particular, after learning that he was banned for five games, Murich was in a very bad mood. He always locked himself in his room. Fortunately, his wife always stayed with him to guide him. It was nearly 20 hours after the punishment that Murich walked out of the door. He had his first meal in 20 hours at noon on the 17th. Sina Sports also contacted Murichi through the translator of Hengda Team. Murichi said: I want to thank my wife now. When I encounter difficulties, she is always with me, and I also thank the club, they always comfort me. Speaking of the punishment this time, Murich said: I think the punishment of the Football Association is unfair to me. I didn't go to hurt anyone violently, but now that I have been punished, I will accept it whether it is fair or not. What I want to say is that I am very grateful to the club. Although the club has also been punished, I will first accept the punishment of the club. I think the punishment of the club is to help me. Since I can accept the punishment of the club, I also accept and obey the punishment of the Football Association. With regard to the impact of his suspension on the team, this is the most sad thing for Murichi: The club has always been very nice to me, giving me a lot of help in all aspects. I have always been eager to reward the club and the team with good performance, but now I can't play, I feel very sad, and I hope my teammates can help the team achieve good results while I am serving my suspension.

八旬老太靠卖菜过活走红30年仅见国外儿子一面本报讯(记者郑磊)本该是安享晚年的年龄，85岁的周瑞英老奶奶却独自在马甸桥地下通道内卖菜。近日，这位在网络上走红的“果蔬奶奶”受到了不少关注，很多居民在下班时都会刻意路过给她捧个场。果蔬奶奶不再孤单昨天下午5点半，海淀区马甸桥东南角的地下通道外，一位头发花白、拎着布包和塑料袋的老人出现了。“这不是‘果蔬奶奶’么！”一位小伙子叫出声来。看着将要走下楼梯的老人，这位小伙子快步上前，“周奶奶，我帮您拿吧！”之后，小伙子从脸上布满微笑的周瑞英老人手里接过了蔬菜。之后，又有3位年轻人认出了老人，主动帮助她搬运蔬菜。几位年轻人放妥了蔬菜准备离去时，周奶奶弯下不太利索的身体，拿起一小袋香瓜对着几位年轻人说，“孩子，这些水果你们拿着吃吧，天热，吃点儿败火”。“我们改天买您的东西。”几位年轻人笑着离开。30年只见儿子一面还不到6点，由于还没到下班高峰，周奶奶垫了张报纸，坐在自己的摊边与记者聊起了自己的家人。老人听力不好，据她说，是年轻时候得了一场病所致，跟人说话时，老人会把左耳贴到别人嘴边。周奶奶说，身为徐州人的她年轻时跟随军官丈夫来到北京。之后，儿子还考取了清华大学，在大学毕业后，儿子前往美国攻读研究生。之后，周奶奶的儿子在国外娶妻生子，“30多年了我只见过他一回，就是他爸去世的那年”，老人低着头不断念叨着，老伴在3年前因为肺癌去世了。谈起为什么不叫儿子回来陪她，老人摆摆手说：“回来一趟太贵了，我自己能活。”在对话中，每次谈到儿子，老人的语气和神态明显低落很多。老人还补充说自己年轻时还生过一个女儿，但很快就送人了。市民捧场老人繁忙晚上6点，过往的行人渐渐增多，周奶奶的地摊也红火起来。除了不断前来买菜的市民外，十几位年轻人来到周奶奶的摊位前，“果蔬奶奶，我们来买点儿水果”。“你们都是下班路过的吗？”面对突然增多的年轻人，周奶奶有些不适应。“我们是路过的。”对方答道。“这个豇豆可以煮着吃，也可以焯一下蘸酱吃。”卖每种果蔬时老人都会多嘱咐几句。记者随后了解到，这群年轻人是北京的一些网友，他们相约前来为周奶奶捧场特意组织的队伍。在场的每个人都或多或少买了一些果蔬，不少人把最后的零头都留给了老人，称这也算是一种救济。只想平平淡淡卖菜据了解，老人有三个愿望。一是配一副眼镜，能更多地看清大家的面孔；二是买一个助听器，能听清楚顾客们说的话；三是想镶几颗牙齿，能把饭菜更好地嚼烂，吃得更香一些。周瑞英老人说，这几天，她发现来买果蔬的人比以前多了，很多人还会叫她“果蔬奶奶”，经询问才得知这是网友给她起的名字。“这是我这辈子第一个外号。”对于这个名字，老人笑着说。老人同时表示，虽然有媒体前来采访，但她并不在乎，她只是希望给下班晚买不上蔬菜水果的人们提供一个便宜、方便的场所。“平平淡淡地经营挺好。”她说。■对话·首发微博者庆幸自己帮到老人京华时报：当初是怎么想到发这条微博的？程小撑：当天我是碰巧路过，看到老人的第一眼很震撼，感觉跟自己的姥姥很像，觉得有必要帮她一下。京华时报：现在已经有不少网友关注并前来为老奶奶捧场，你怎么想？程小撑：当初只是想着能让住在周围的人关注一下，没想到反响这么大，我觉得我的目的达到了，挺开心的。京华时报：现在老人的菜摊，有时会突然出现一批人来买老人的菜，有没有想过太多人可能会影响老人的生活？程小撑：这个真没想过，一条微博转发万次以上并不少见，可是引起这么大的效应出乎我的意料。希望大家不会太影响老人吧。	程小撑,周奶奶,小伙子,郑磊,周瑞英,周奶奶的儿子	正向	"An 85 year old grandmother, who should have been enjoying her twilight years, has been selling vegetables alone in the underground channel of Maddian Bridge for 30 years. She has only seen her son abroad. (Zheng Lei, reporter) Recently, the popular ""fruit and vegetable grandma"" on the Internet has received a lot of attention, and many residents will deliberately pass by to give her a job when they get off work. Grandma Fruits and Vegetables is no longer alone. At 5:30 yesterday afternoon, outside the underground channel at the southeast corner of Maddian Bridge, Haidian District, an old man with white hair and a cloth bag and a plastic bag appeared. ""This is Grandma Fruits and Vegetables!"" A young man cried out. Looking at the old man who was going to walk down the stairs, the young man walked quickly forward and said, ""Grandma Zhou, I'll help you!"" After that, the young man took the vegetables from Grandma Zhou Ruiying, who was smiling on his face. Later, three young people recognized the old man and offered to help her carry vegetables. When several young people put away the vegetables and were ready to leave, Grandma Zhou bent down her body that was not very neat, picked up a small bag of melons and said to the young people, ""Children, you can take these fruits to eat. It's hot, eat some fire."" ""We'll buy your things another day."" Several young people leave with a smile. I only saw my son for 30 years. It was less than 6 o'clock. Because it was not yet the peak of work, Grandma Zhou put a newspaper on her stall and talked with the reporter about her family members. The old man's hearing was poor. According to her, it was caused by a disease when he was young. When talking to people, the old man would stick his left ear to others' mouths. Grandma Zhou said that when she was young, she came to Beijing with her army husband as a Xuzhou citizen. Later, his son also passed the examination of Tsinghua University. After graduation from university, his son went to America to study for a postgraduate degree. Later, Grandma Zhou's son got married and had children abroad. ""I have only seen him once in more than 30 years, the year his father died,"" the old man said, bowing his head and chanting. The old partner died of lung cancer three years ago. Talking about why not to call her son back to accompany her, the old woman waved her hand and said: ""It's too expensive to come back, and I can live on my own."" In the conversation, every time he talked about his son, the old man's tone and manner obviously declined a lot. The old man also added that he had a daughter when he was young, but he gave her away soon. The public holds an evening rush hour for the busy old people at 6:00 p.m., and the number of passers-by gradually increases, and Grandma Zhou's stall also becomes popular. In addition to the citizens who keep coming to buy vegetables, a dozen young people come to Grandma Zhou's stall and say, ""Grandma Fruits and Vegetables, we will buy some fruit"". ""Are you all passing by on your way home from work?"" Faced with the sudden increase of young people, Grandma Zhou is somewhat uncomfortable. ""We are passing by."" The other side answered. ""This cowpea can be cooked and dipped in sauce."" When selling each kind of fruit and vegetables, the old man will give more instructions. Later, the reporter learned that these young people were some netizens in Beijing. They made an appointment to come here to organize a team for Grandma Zhou. Everyone present bought some fruits and vegetables or left the last change to the old people, saying that it was also a relief. I just want to sell vegetables in a simple way. It is understood that the old man has three wishes. One is to get a pair of glasses to see everyone's faces more clearly; The second is to buy a hearing aid to hear what customers say clearly; The third is to want to inlay some teeth, so that the food can be chewed better and taste better. Grandma Zhou Ruiying said that in recent days, she had found that more people came to buy fruits and vegetables than before, and many people called her ""Fruit and Vegetable Grandma"", and only after asking did she know that this was the name given by netizens. ""This is my first nickname in my life."" The old man said with a smile. The old man also said that although the media came to interview her, she didn't care. She just hoped to provide a cheap and convenient place for people who could not afford vegetables and fruits after work. ""It's good to run in a plain and plain way."" She said. ■ Dialogue · The microblogger who made his debut is lucky to help the old people Beijing Huaxia Times: How did you think of sending this microblog at the beginning? Cheng Xiaocheng: I happened to pass by that day. When I saw the old man for the first time, I was shocked. I felt like my grandmother. I thought it was necessary to help her. Beijing Huaxia Times: Now that many netizens have paid attention to and come to give Grandma a lot of attention, what do you think? Cheng Xiaocheng: At first, I just thought that people who live around could pay attention. I didn't expect such a big response. I think my goal has been achieved, and I'm quite happy. Beijing Huaxia Times: Now, there is sometimes a sudden appearance of a group of people to buy the old man's vegetables at the old man's vegetable stall. Have you ever thought that too many people may affect the old man's life? Cheng Xiaocheng: I really didn't think about this. It is not uncommon for a microblog to be forwarded more than 10000 times, but it is unexpected that it will cause such a big effect. I hope everyone will not affect the old people too much."

阿桑奇强奸等罪若确认将被引渡到瑞典判刑当地时间12月7日，维基解密创始人兼主编朱利安·阿桑奇被伦敦警方逮捕。维基解密立即对此表示抗议，并强调会采取应对行动。早些时候，瑞典警方以涉嫌强奸和性骚扰等罪名，向整个欧洲乃至全球发出了针对阿桑奇的通缉令。律师否认阿桑奇自首12月7日，英国伦敦警方对媒体公布了一份声明，称维基解密创始人兼主编阿桑奇在当天9时30分左右被捕。该声明强调，逮捕是基于瑞典发出的欧洲通用通缉令作出的。本月2日，瑞典向欧洲和全球发出了通缉令，指控阿桑奇涉嫌强奸和性骚扰。当时，阿桑奇已经来到英国伦敦。英方随后约见阿桑奇的律师，向其表达了将会逮捕阿桑奇的立场。阿桑奇的律师强烈谴责逮捕行为，并否认媒体盛传的阿桑奇可能自首的消息。现年39岁的澳大利亚人阿桑奇被瑞典警方指控，在今年8月犯下强奸罪以及对两位女士实施性骚扰。不过，阿桑奇对此一直予以否认，并谴责瑞典警方的指控带有政治目的。引渡可能经历数月依据媒体透露的消息，阿桑奇在当地时间7日晚些时候将在伦敦威斯敏斯特法庭出庭受审。报道称，如果法庭最终认为阿桑奇犯罪事实证据确凿，他将被引渡到瑞典判刑。在法官作出引渡判决之前，阿桑奇将被羁押在英国，同时也存在被保释的可能。从定罪到引渡的整个过程可能将持续数月之久。自上周以来，维基解密麻烦不断，包括该机构的瑞士银行账号被注销、信用卡付款平台被封、网站被攻击等。美国政府甚至发起了针对维基解密以及阿桑奇本人的犯罪调查，指控其威胁到美国的国家安全和全球的外交行动。尽管阿桑奇被捕，然而维基解密发言人克里斯丁·哈拉夫森评论说，维基解密强烈谴责逮捕阿桑奇的行为，并表示会坚持既有的公布秘密文件的行动。(张乐)英媒体爆料维基解密创始人同时与两名女性有染维基解密创始人成长历程揭秘：幼时颠沛流离	张乐,阿桑奇,克里斯丁·哈拉夫森	负向	If Assange's rape and other crimes are confirmed, he will be extradited to Sweden for sentencing. On December 7, local time, Julian Assange, the founder and editor in chief of WikiLeaks, was arrested by the London police. WikiLeaks immediately protested and stressed that it would take action. Earlier, the Swedish police issued an arrest warrant for Assange throughout Europe and even the world on the grounds of rape, sexual harassment and other crimes. The lawyer denied that Assange surrendered. On December 7, the London police of the United Kingdom issued a statement to the media, saying that Julian Assange, the founder and editor in chief of WikiLeaks, was arrested at about 9:30 on the same day. The statement stressed that the arrest was based on the European general arrest warrant issued by Sweden. On the 2nd of this month, Sweden issued a warrant to Europe and the world, accusing Assange of rape and sexual harassment. At that time, Assange had come to London, Britain. The British side then met with Assange's lawyer and expressed its position that Assange would be arrested. Assange's lawyer strongly condemned the arrest and denied the media's widely reported news that Assange might surrender. The 39-year old Australian Assange was charged by the Swedish police with rape and sexual harassment of two women in August this year. However, Assange has always denied it and condemned the Swedish police's accusation of political aims. According to the news revealed by the media, Assange will appear in the Westminster Court in London for trial later on the evening of the 7th local time. It is reported that if the court finally finds that Assange's criminal facts are conclusive, he will be extradited to Sweden for sentencing. Assange will be detained in the UK until the judge makes an extradition ruling, and it is also possible to be released on bail. The whole process from conviction to extradition may last for several months. Since last week, WikiLeaks has been in constant trouble, including the cancellation of the agency's Swiss bank account, the blocking of the credit card payment platform, and the attack on the website. The US government has even launched a criminal investigation against WikiLeaks and Assange, accusing them of threatening the national security of the United States and the global diplomatic actions. Although Assange was arrested, WikiLeaks spokesman Christian Harafson commented that WikiLeaks strongly condemned the arrest of Assange and said that it would stick to the action of publishing secret documents. (Zhang Le) The British media revealed that the founder of WikiLeaks was involved with two women at the same time. The growth process of the founder of WikiLeaks was revealed: he was homeless when he was young
叶尚志：回调幅度已接近安全边际■港股手记⊙第一上海证券叶尚志○编辑杨晓坤11月10日，港股继续整固调整的态势，连跌了第二个交易日。从盘面上来看，市况还不至于全面向淡。事实上，我们相信港股正处于强势调整当中，建议可以把握低买的机会。内地将在今天公布一系列经济数据，最引人注目的肯定是10月份消费物价指数(CPI)，市场普遍预期会进一步上升至4%。另一方面，二十国集团G20高峰会也会在今天召开，这个对于美元走势以及资金流向，都会构成关键影响。恒生指数昨日呈现反复调整，下压到了24400点关口水平后打横，在填补了最近一个跳升缺口24550至24733点区间的背景下，我们估计港股的承接力会有逐步增强的机会。恒生指数收盘报24501点，下跌210点，主板成交量有1092亿多元。技术上，恒生指数目前水平的安全边际已经提高了，在调整了两天之后，股指跟平均线组合的偏离幅度已出现了改善。另一方面，在美联局落实推出二度量化宽松之后，恒生指数的爆发起点是在24145点，也就是上周三的收盘价。倘若市场对于二度量宽的信心未有变化，恒生指数应该不会跌回到24145点以下。中国人民银行宣布调高存款准备金率0.5个百分点，本月16日正式生效。消息对于实体经济的影响应该较大，相信是属于调控过度泛滥流动性为主，并不是打压举动。而内银股经过了近期的回整后，调整幅度平均已有5%，相信股价的支撑力有逐步增强的机会。值得关注的是，内地保险股出现了逆市走高的行程，内地进入加息周期，对于保险股的利息收入会有提升空间。中国平安(2318)涨了3.6%，中国财险(2328)涨了0.17%，中国太保(2601)涨了3.13%。	叶尚志,杨晓坤	正向	Ye Shangzhi: the callback has approached the safety margin ▲ Hong Kong Stock Handbook ⊙Ye Shangzhi of the First Shanghai Securities○Editor Yang Xiaokun On November 10, Hong Kong shares continued to consolidate and adjust, falling for the second trading day. From the market, the situation is not yet pessimistic as a whole. In fact, we believe that Hong Kong shares are in a strong adjustment, and we suggest that we can grasp the opportunity of low buying. The mainland will release a series of economic data today, the most notable of which is the consumer price index (CPI) in October, which is generally expected to rise further to 4%. On the other hand, the G20 summit of the Group of Twenty will also be held today, which will have a key impact on the trend of the US dollar and the flow of funds. The Hang Seng Index showed repeated adjustments yesterday, and then went sideways after being pressed down to the level of 24400 o'clock. On the background of filling in the recent jump gap of 24550 to 24733 points, we estimate that Hong Kong shares will have an opportunity of gradual enhancement of承接力. The Hang Seng Index closed at 24501, down 210 points, and the main board's trading volume was more than 109.2 billion yuan. Technically, the safety margin of the current level of the Hang Seng Index has been increased. After two days of adjustment, the deviation of the stock index from the average line combination has improved. On the other hand, after the Federal Bureau implemented the second round of quantitative easing, the starting point of the Hang Seng Index's outbreak was 24145 points, that is, the closing price last Wednesday. If the market's confidence in the two quantitative easing measures remains unchanged, the Hang Seng Index should not fall below 24145 points. The People's Bank of China announced to raise the deposit reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points, which will take effect officially on the 16th of this month. The news should have a greater impact on the real economy, and it is believed that the main focus is on controlling the excessive flooding of liquidity, rather than suppressing it. After the recent adjustment of domestic bank stocks, the average adjustment range has reached 5%, and it is believed that the stock price has a chance of gradual enhancement of support. It is worth noting that the domestic insurance shares have risen against the market, and the mainland has entered the interest rate hike cycle, which will increase the interest income of insurance shares. Ping An of China (2318) rose 3.6%, China Finance (2328) rose 0.17%, and China Pacific Insurance (2601) rose 3.13%.
价格太高中国连续两周未进口美国大豆卢进高企的美国大豆价格正在令买家望而却步。在截至6月4日的两周内，全球最大的大豆进口国——中国已经没有出现在美国大豆买家的列表当中，不仅如此，在过去的两周内，中国还将此前确定的进口量削减了十多万吨。昨日，美国农业部(USDA)公布了截至6月4日的一周出口销售报告，当周美国2008/2009年度(2008年9月1日起)大豆净出口销售量为-6.1万吨，远远低于此前分析师预计的20万~30万吨水平。在这一周内，中国削减进口量5.5万吨。而在截至5月28日的一周内，美国大豆出口量同样也为负值。当周，大豆净出口量为-2.4万吨，中国削减进口11.26万吨。今年以来，由于美国大豆价格相对便宜，阿根廷大豆产量因干旱原因大幅减少，包括中国在内的大豆进口国对美国大豆的需求高涨。据USDA统计，截至5月28日，美国2008/2009年度大豆累计出口销售量为3373.63万吨，去年同期为3001.43万吨。中国累计购买美豆1846.91万吨，去年同期为1342.67万吨。美国大豆的“疯狂”出口使得该国大豆库存快速下降，USDA周三的月度报告预计，2008/2009年度，美国大豆期末库存仅1.1亿蒲式耳(约合300万吨)，这将是1973年以来的最低库存量。在库存吃紧的情况下，美国大豆在过去三个月内快速上涨，截至昨日北京时间22点，芝加哥商品交易所(CBOT)大豆7月合约期价报1260美分/蒲式耳，较3月中旬上涨了近45%。此前便宜的美国大豆，现在变得非常昂贵。据黑龙江天琪期货估算，如果按照目前的大豆期货价格点价进口，美国大豆到达中国港口的成本价将高达4300元/吨，这远远高于3600~3800元/吨的国产大豆价格。在高企的大豆价格面前，中国只好对美国大豆“退避三舍”。		负向	"The high price of soybeans in the United States has made buyers hesitate. China, the world's largest soybean importer, has not appeared on the list of American soybean buyers in the two weeks ending June 4. Moreover, in the past two weeks, China has cut the previously determined import volume by more than 100000 tons. Yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the export sales report for the week ending June 4. The net export sales volume of soybeans in the United States in the 2008/2009 season (starting from September 1, 2008) was -61000 tons, far lower than the level of 200000-300000 tons expected by analysts earlier. In this week, China reduced its imports by 55000 tons. In the week ending May 28, the United States also had negative soybean exports. In that week, the net export volume of soybeans was -24000 tons, and China cut imports by 112600 tons. Since this year, due to the fact that the price of soybeans in the United States is relatively cheap and the soybean production in Argentina has decreased significantly due to drought, soybean importing countries including China have had a high demand for soybeans in the United States. According to the USDA statistics, as of May 28, the cumulative export sales volume of soybeans in the United States in 2008/2009 was 33.7363 million tons, compared with 30.0143 million tons in the same period last year. China has cumulatively purchased 18.4691 million tons of soybeans in the United States, compared with 13.4267 million tons in the same period last year. The ""crazy"" export of soybeans in the United States has led to a rapid decline in soybean stocks in the country. The monthly report of the USDA on Wednesday is expected to be 1.1 billion bushels (about 3 million tons) of soybean stocks in the United States at the end of 2008/2009, the lowest level since 1973. In the case of tight inventory, the price of soybeans in the United States has risen rapidly in the past three months. By 22:00 Beijing time yesterday, the July soybean contract price of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CBOT) was reported at 1260 cents/bushel, up nearly 45% from mid March. The previously cheap soybeans in the United States are now very expensive. According to the estimation of Heilongjiang Tianqi Futures, if soybean futures prices are imported according to the current soybean futures prices, the cost price of American soybeans arriving at Chinese ports will reach 4300 yuan/ton, far higher than the domestic soybean price of 3600 ~ 3800 yuan/ton. In the face of high soybean prices, China has to ""retreat three miles"" from American soybeans."
期指新老空军司令分歧加大□晨报记者张佳?昨日A股在权重股带领下小幅微调，沪深300指数下跌15点，跌幅为0.43%，最终报收于3466.08点。而期指合约表现大体与现货相若。近期合约方面，IF1011合约下跌23点，跌幅为0.64%，报收3558.20点，期现货价差跌破100点报收92.12点，全日共成交235559张，未平仓合约数为29142张，较上一交易日减少1384张；IF1012合约则下跌21.40点，跌幅0.59%，报收3591.60点，期现货价差为125.52点，全日共成交13614张，未平仓合约数为7798张，较上一交易日增加247张。远期合约方面，IF1103合约下跌20.20点，跌幅0.55%，报收3655点，期现货价差为188.92点，全日共成交1377张，未平仓合约数为2198张，较上一交易日增加283张；IF1106合约则下跌13.8点，跌幅为0.37%，报收3710.4点，期现货价差为244.32点，全日共成交251张，未平仓合约数为456张，较上一交易日增加48张。从昨日主力合约IF1011合约的期现货价差日内走势来看，高企不下的期现货价差值终于因为昨日下午的一波小幅跳水而有所缩窄。昨天上午，期现货价差大多数时间是在105点至135点之间盘整，但到下午跳水后，一度最低不过85点左右，虽然此后由于沪深300指数并未继续跳水期现货价差有所回升，但是也不过是在95点至105点之间盘整。虽然期现货价差收窄，但是对套利者而言依然有2.66%的套利空间，考虑到这是不足一个月的套利收益，还是极为可观的。中金所披露的持仓数据显示，昨日老牌“空军司令”国泰君安持有的多单为2264张，较上一交易日减少70张；持有的空单为5232张，较上一交易日减少260张，净空单数减少190张至2968张。至于新锐“空军司令”中证期货，持有的多单为1843张，较上一交易日锐减464张，持有的空单为5643张，较上一交易日增加71张，净空单数增加535张至3800张。对于后市，新老“空军司令”出现了分歧，国泰君安虽然并没有积极做多，但至少在减少总头寸的同时略微偏多，而中证期货却是在大举减持空单的同时轻微增持空单，看空的意味要明显强于国泰君安。		正向	"The divergence between the new and old air force commanders of the futures index was increasing□晨 Zhang Jia? Yesterday's A-shares made a slight adjustment under the leadership of weighted stocks. The Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index fell 15 points, or 0.43%, and finally closed at 3466.08 points. The futures index contract performed largely like the spot. In terms of recent contracts, the IF1011 contract fell 23 points, or 0.64%, and closed at 3558.20 points. The spot price spread of futures and spot broke through 100 points and closed at 92.12 points. A total of 235559 tickets were traded in the whole day, with 29142 open interest contracts, 1384 less than the previous trading day; The IF1012 contract fell 21.40 points, or 0.59%, and closed at 3591.60 points. The spot price spread of futures and spot was 125.52 points. A total of 13614 tickets were traded in the whole day, with 7798 open interest contracts, 247 more than the previous trading day. In terms of forward contracts, the IF1103 contract fell 20.20 points, or 0.55%, and closed at 3655 points. The spot price spread of futures and spot was 188.92 points. A total of 1377 tickets were traded in the whole day, with 2198 open interest contracts, 283 more than the previous trading day; The IF1106 contract fell 13.8 points, or 0.37%, and closed at 3710.4. The spot price spread of futures and spot was 244.32 points. A total of 251 tickets were traded in the whole day, with 456 open interest contracts, 48 more than the previous trading day. From the intra-day trend of the spot price spread of the main contract IF1011 futures contract yesterday, the high spot price spread finally narrowed because of a slight dive in the afternoon. Yesterday morning, the spot price spread was mostly between 105 and 135 o'clock, but after the afternoon dive, it was once as low as 85 o'clock. Later, due to the fact that the CSI 300 Index did not continue to dive, the spot price spread recovered, but it was just consolidating between 95 and 105 o'clock. Although the spot price spread of futures and spot narrowed, it still has an arbitrage space of 2.66% for arbitrageurs. Considering that this is less than a month's arbitrage income, it is still very considerable. The position data disclosed by CICC shows that Guotai Junan, the old ""Air Force Commander"", held 2264 long orders yesterday, 70 less than the previous trading day; Short orders held were 5232, 260 less than the previous trading day, and the number of short orders decreased by 190 to 2968. As for the new ""Air Force Commander"", CSFC Futures held 1843 long orders, a sharp decrease of 464 from the previous trading day, and 5643 short orders, an increase of 71 from the previous trading day, with the number of short orders increasing by 535 to 3800. As for the future market, the new and old ""air force commanders"" have diverged. Guotai Junan did not actively do more, but at least it slightly prefers to reduce the total position, while CSFC Futures is slightly increasing short orders while aggressively reducing short orders, and the bearish meaning is obviously stronger than Guotai Junan."

中国电信SP管理具行业示范效应-本报记者余祖江信息产业部通报显示，今年第二季度，涉及SP收费争议方面的用户申诉共计1421件，比上季度下降7.85%，继续呈稳步下降趋势。其中，相关基础电信企业负责为SP企业提供接入服务和收费的，涉及中国电信58件，比上季度下降29.27%。在四大运营商中，中国电信SP被投诉最少。对于SP的管理，基础电信企业责无旁贷。随着增值业务的日趋繁荣，SP市场规范化运行的重要性凸显。未来的竞争是产业链之间的竞争，信息服务的提供需要共同做大产业链。针对SP监管得力虽然申诉总体下降明显，但是相对比较集中。数据显示，涉及中国移动789件，比上季度下降2.11%；涉及中国联通516件，比上季度下降13.71%；涉及中国网通58件，比上季度上升3.57%。目前，根据“谁接入谁负责”的原则，主要是由基础电信企业负责管理相关SP。对涉及中国电信的SP投诉较少，在一定程度上表明中国电信对于SP的监管取得了成效。2007年，信息产业部确立了“三谁原则”，即“谁主管谁负责”，“谁经营谁负责”，“谁接入谁负责”，旨在明确各环节责任，消除责任死角，规范电信信息服务管理。为此，中国电信针对互联网、声讯、小灵通短信等各类合作业务，建立了一系列规章制度，对SP的网络接入、内容审核、代收费管理、经营考核等各方面实行严格把关，以确保合作伙伴提供合法、健康的内容。比如，中国电信建立所接入SP的信誉积分管理制度，将合作SP违规行为纳入企业间合作管理范围。固网增值业务待挖潜根据信息产业部电信研究院的统计和估算，截至2006年12月底，我国增值电信业务市场总规模超过1560亿元，预计2007年将超过1600亿元。无疑，增值业务市场是一座“金矿”。与移动增值业务相比，固网增值业务的市场规模较小。我国现有的增值业务，按照收入排名，依次为信息服务、ISP、IDC与呼叫中心等，而在信息服务收入中，移动信息服务占了75%的份额，互联网信息服务为23%，电话信息服务则为2%。显然，移动网对于SP更具吸引力，但是，固网同样有吸引并留住SP的理由。固网增值业务仍有很大的增长空间。包括IPTV、固话手机一号通、宽带、其他SP提供的增值业务等，这就是未来的新价值空间。移动信息服务是趋势移动增值业务发展迅速，已成为电信运营商业务收入增长的主要拉动力量。财报显示，今年上半年，中移动的增值业务收入较去年同期上升35.5%至419.15亿元，占总营运收入比例达25.5%。作为移动增值业务产业价值链中的重要参与者，SP群体迅速壮大。据介绍，在2004年，获得经营许可证的SP企业只有693个，现在，从事增值业务的企业猛增到了近2万家，申请移动增值业务的企业也越来越多。移动增值业务的发展前景广阔。一方面，中国的移动通信用户数已经超过了5亿，而所有这些用户都是移动增值业务的潜在用户；另一方面，移动增值业务的渗透率仅在30%左右，有着巨大的发展空间。北京邮电大学曾剑秋教授表示，随着我国3G的上马，窄带向宽带的升级，传统的语音业务时代将转变成增值业务时代。因此，增值业务的发展离不开3G的支持。我国电信增值业务市场变化速度在加快，行业发展趋于理性。基础电信运营商应与更多的企业进行合作，不断创新运营模式，提高产业链竞争力。	曾剑秋,余祖江	正向	"China Telecom SP management has industry demonstration effect - Yu Zujiang, a reporter of this newspaper, showed that the Ministry of Information Industry reported that in the second quarter of this year, there were a total of 1421 complaints from users involving SP charging disputes, down 7.85% from the previous quarter, and continued to decline steadily. Among them, the basic telecommunications enterprises are responsible for providing access services and charging for SP enterprises, involving 58 complaints of China Telecom, down 29.27% from the previous quarter. Among the four major operators, China Telecom SP was complained the least. The basic telecom enterprises are indispensable for SP management. With the increasing prosperity of value-added services, the importance of the standardized operation of the SP market has become prominent. The future competition is between industrial chains, and the provision of information services requires the industrial chain to be expanded together. In terms of SP supervision, although complaints have declined significantly as a whole, they are relatively concentrated. The data shows that 789 cases involving China Mobile, down 2.11% from the previous quarter; 516 cases involving China Unicom, down 13.71% from the previous quarter; 58 cases involving China Netcom, up 3.57% from the previous quarter. At present, according to the principle of ""whoever connects is responsible"", the basic telecommunications enterprises are mainly responsible for managing the relevant SP. The fact that there are fewer complaints about SP involving China Telecom indicates to a certain extent that China Telecom's supervision of SP has achieved results. In 2007, the Ministry of Information Industry established the ""three who principles"", namely, ""who is in charge is responsible"", ""who operates is responsible"", and ""who connects is responsible"", aiming to clarify responsibilities at all links, eliminate responsibility dead corners, and standardize the management of telecommunications information services. For this reason, China Telecom has established a series of rules and regulations for various cooperative services such as the Internet, voice communication, and Petitcom short messages, and has implemented strict control over various aspects such as network access, content review, agency charge management, and operation evaluation of SP, in order to ensure that partners provide legal and healthy content. For example, China Telecom established a credit scoring management system for the SPs it connects, which includes the violation of cooperative SPs in the scope of inter enterprise cooperation management. According to the statistics and estimation of the Telecommunications Research Institute of the Ministry of Information Industry, by the end of December 2006, the total scale of the value-added telecommunications market in China had exceeded 156 billion yuan, and it is expected to exceed 160 billion yuan in 2007. Undoubtedly, the value-added business market is a ""gold mine"". Compared with mobile value-added services, the scale of fixed network value-added services is small. The existing value-added services in China, ranked by income, are information services, ISPs, IDC and call centers, and in the income of information services, mobile information services account for 75% of the share, Internet information services are 23%, and telephone information services are 2%. Obviously, the mobile network is more attractive to SP, but the fixed network also has reasons to attract and retain SP. There is still a lot of room for growth in the value-added business of fixed networks. Including IPTV, one number pass for fixed telephone mobile phone, broadband, value-added services provided by other SP, etc., this is the new value space in the future. Mobile information service is a trend. Mobile value-added services are developing rapidly and have become the main driving force for the growth of telecom operators' business revenue. The financial report shows that in the first half of this year, the value-added service revenue of China Mobile rose 35.5% from the same period last year to 41.915 billion yuan, accounting for 25.5% of the total operating revenue. As an important participant in the mobile value-added business industry value chain, the SP group is growing rapidly. According to reports, in 2004, there were only 693 SP enterprises with business licenses, now, the number of enterprises engaged in value-added businesses has soared to nearly 20000, and the number of enterprises applying for mobile value-added businesses is also increasing. The development prospects of mobile value-added services are broad. On the one hand, the number of mobile communication users in China has exceeded 500 million, and all these users are potential users of mobile value-added services; On the other hand, the penetration rate of mobile value-added services is only about 30%, which has a huge development space. Professor Zeng Jiaoqiu of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications said that with the launch of 3G in China and the upgrading of narrowband to broadband, the traditional voice service era will change to the value-added service era. Therefore, the development of value-added services is inseparable from the support of 3G. The change speed of China's telecom value-added service market is accelerating, and the industry development is becoming more rational. Basic telecom operators should cooperate with more enterprises, continuously innovate operation modes, and improve the competitiveness of the industrial chain."

考研网站出现假文凭广告引网友热议-新快报记者邓毅富《研究生招生网与作弊答案和假学历同行》，10月31日，猫扑网站一个名为“今天你干了CLY”的网友加了这样一个帖子。“今天你干了CLY”说的网站，是指“中国研究生招生信息网”，据截图显示，网站网页点开帖子以后，在右边一栏中，出现谷歌网站的随机广告，广告的内容是贩卖假文凭和考试答案。此事引起了网友们的热议，有人认为，这跟网站无关，因为是谷歌广告附带随机生成的；也有人认为，网站有拒绝不恰当广告的责任。考研网站出现“一条龙服务”引网友热议页面内容很“雷”人“今天闲来无聊，浏览了一下‘中国研究生招生信息网’，在里面看到一些信息，用现在流行的话来说，就是‘很雷’——该网的招生信息和作弊答案、假学历广告竟出现在同一页面上”。10月31日，网友“今天你干了CLY”在猫扑网上加了这样一个帖子，并提供了截图。截图的页面显示：在打开一条《研究生网报31日结束11月10日至14日现场确认》的帖子之后，页面右边有一栏广告。这个广告称：“速取本科、研究生(真实学历)”，并附带了联系电话；另一条广告称：“研究生考试答案QQ×××××××××”，该广告还细分为“09考研过关”和“考研过关”两项，并都附带上QQ号码。记者找到了“中国研究生招生信息网”，按图索骥,发现情况果然如网友“今天你干了CLY”所说。“中国研究生招生信息网”的主管单位是“教育部高校学生司”、主办单位是“全国高等学校学生信息咨询与就业指导中心”、承办单位是“学信咨询服务有限公司”。从网站内容看，它内容丰富，除了教育部和各地的招生考试信息外，还有网上报名考研的功能，人气相当热。而网友“今天你干了CLY”披露的考试作弊广告就出现在与“考研动态”的各篇文章的同一网页的右边栏广告位置上，并有“Google提供的广告”等字样。网站广告谁负责任？对于作弊广告究竟是不是“中国研究生招生信息网”的责任，网友们展开了热议。网友“半导体”认为：“页面旁边是谷歌的广告栏，这事要找谷歌，广告投放内容是由谷歌决定的。谷歌的广告是根据网站的内容自动匹配相关的广告的。”而一位自称是做网络广告的网友“理更深的蓝”则指出：“这是谷歌的网络广告，网站是有权利是否投放广告产生盈利，但没有权利屏蔽内容。只要广告主肯付钱。出现这样的情况首先一点是谷歌没有做好内容屏蔽；二是网站为了盈利投放广告。双方都负有责任。”网友“山夫”则认为这个广告只是“骗钱”：“说白了骗傻瓜和求捷径人的钱，钱汇出去了，就没有回音。”网友“红风车”则称：“一切皆有可能嘛，中国是块神奇的土壤。”网友“路过红尘”说：“我老婆在东北某知名大学读研，惊奇地发现自己是寝室唯一一个不买答案考上的……”网友“laijiaxing2002”则调侃说：“谷歌的广告是很公正的，这则广告绝对是与该网页内容相关程度最高的产品，很真实，很好地反映了社会的和谐、自然的和谐、万物相生相克。”网友“路了卿”则爆料：“中国社会资源和保障部，就是国家公务员考试网上还有卖答案的，真令人崩溃了……”网友“良民良言”由此表达了自己对考研的不信任：“我已经发狂了，现在我看到称自己是研究生的人我也不把当他研究生了。”但网友“茶煲”则认为这只是极个别的现象：“一般说来，重点院校的研究生录取还是很公平的，即使是本校的学生考取本校的研究生也是十分辛苦的。”而大部分网友也表示了深深的忧虑:“这样子只会给想不劳而获的人提供了捷径，而一个号称正规教育的官方网站，竟然对这样的广告不管不问，以后谁会相信文凭跟学历的纯洁？”	邓毅富	负向	"The appearance of fake diploma advertisements on the postgraduate examination website has caused a heated discussion among netizens - Xinkuai News reporter Deng Yifeng and his colleagues from the Graduate Recruitment Network and Cheating Answers and Fake Degrees.

According to the screenshot, after the website page clicks on the post, a random advertisement from the Google website appears in the right column, and the content of the advertisement is to sell fake diplomas and examination answers. This incident has caused a heated discussion among netizens. Some people think that it has nothing to do with the website because it is a random generation of Google advertising; Others believe that the website has the responsibility to reject inappropriate advertisements. The postgraduate examination website appears ""one-stop service"", which causes a heated discussion among netizens. The page content is very ""lei"". ""Today, I was bored, so I browsed the 'China Graduate Admission Information Network', and saw some information in it.

The screenshot page shows: After opening a post entitled ""The postgraduate network newspaper ends on the 31st, and the on-site confirmation is from November 10 to 14"", there is a column of advertisements on the right side of the page. The advertisement says: ""Quick Bachelor's Degree, Graduate Degree (Real Degree)"", and is attached with a telephone number; Another advertisement says: ""Postgraduate examination answers QQ × × × × × × × × ×"", and the advertisement is further divided into ""09 pass the postgraduate examination"" and ""pass the postgraduate examination"", with QQ numbers attached. The reporter found the ""China Graduate Admission Information Network"" and found that the situation was indeed as the netizen ""Today, you have done CLY"" said. The competent authority of ""China Graduate Admission Information Network"" is ""Ministry of Education, Department of University Students"", the sponsor is ""National Center for Students' Information Consulting and Employment Guidance of Colleges and Universities"", and the sponsor is ""Xuexin Consulting Service Co., Ltd."". From the website content, it is rich. In addition to the admission and examination information of the Ministry of Education and各地, it also has the function of online registration for postgraduate examination, which is quite popular. The cheating advertisement disclosed by netizen ""Today, you have done CLY"" appears on the right column advertisement of the same web page as the ""Postgraduate Dynamics"" article, with the words ""Advertisement Provided by Google"" and so on. Who is responsible for the website advertisement? The netizens had a heated discussion about whether or not the cheating advertisement was the responsibility of the ""China Graduate Admission Information Network"". The netizen ""Semiconductor"" believes: ""The advertisement bar beside the page is Google. This matter should be left to Google, and the advertising content is determined by Google. Google's advertising is automatically matched with relevant advertising according to the content of the website."" However, a netizen who claims to be doing online advertising, ""Li Shenguang Lan"", pointed out: ""This is Google's online advertising. The website has the right to generate profits by whether or not to place advertising, but it has no right to shield content. As long as the advertiser is willing to pay. The first point of such a situation is that Google has not done a good job of content shielding; Second, the website advertises for profit. Both sides are responsible."" The netizen ""Shan Fu"" thought this advertisement was just ""cheating money"": ""In short, it is money for fools and people who seek shortcuts. The money is sent out, and there is no response.""

The netizen ""Good People and Good Words"" thus expressed his distrust of postgraduate studies: ""I have gone crazy. Now, when I see someone who calls himself a postgraduate, I don't think he is a postgraduate."" However, the netizen ""Teapot"" thought that this was only an extremely individual phenomenon: ""Generally speaking, the postgraduate recruitment of key universities is still very fair, and it is very hard for students of the school to pass the postgraduate examination of the school.""

富士康大量招临时工疑为内迁作准备作者/陈小瑛身陷涨薪和内迁疑云的富士康又有新状况。《华夏时报》记者近日在富士康观澜厂区采访发现，数千名从外地学校来的暑期工蜂拥而来，参加培训。为此，富士康还出面高价包下了厂区周边的民宅，用作临时员工宿舍。记者调查后得知，此次批量来富士康接受培训的大学生暑期工，身份上显然和之前从社会上吸纳的人有明显区别；另外，暑期工全部都来自河南。要知道，最近一段时间，关于富士康内迁目的地的传闻最盛的就是河南。富士康是不是在为内迁作准备？在郭台铭出面动员内迁传闻之际，来自富士康的关于内迁的声音少之又少，其迁移方向更是讳莫如深。对此，本报记者多方采访了解到，富士康在这样的时间点的种种做法，很可能是故意在吊胃口，以便造成内地争抢的局面。为内迁作准备？7月5日，富士康观澜厂区北门，一个叫润园小区的农民房小区大楼门口贴出了催促客户搬迁的通知，“因特殊原因，住户必须在7月15日之前搬走。”富士康员工王小庆告诉记者，他住在厂区北门的润园小区共四栋楼，最近富士康来了很多暑期工没地方住，富士康便高价把小区全包下来了。房租暴涨就是缘于富士康突然大量招聘的数千名暑期工，但对数千突如其来的暑期工，富士康并未做足准备。“刚来的很多没法安排住宿，有的就在富士康大门口打地铺睡了4天。”王小庆对记者说。本报记者在富士康观澜厂区了解到，此次前来实习的暑期工全部来自河南，在实习两个月或者三个月后，考察合格并愿意留在富士康的工人将被派往各处工厂。富士康所招实习生也同样享受与工人同等工资待遇，即底薪1200元，加班工资另算。“富士康在郑州大街小巷都贴满了招聘公告，但我看到公告上写的工作地点没有在郑州的，而是淮安、烟台等地。”河南郑州当地人士告诉记者，郑州厂区现在还没开建。在富士康观澜厂区生产苹果电脑的小卢宿舍搬来好几个实习生，都是来自河南，其中，一个学校一起就来了一千多人，所签合同也都是短期的，他们培训两个月后没毕业的将先回学校，毕业的具体去向连他们自己也不知道。记者在富士康观澜厂区南门看到还有前来找工作的人，但富士康缺人，只统一从学校招聘，不对社会公开招聘，这点颇让人看不懂。“这是集团统一策略，根据自身发展需求做出的决定，具体原因我们也不知道，但针对某个特定人群招聘并没有问题。”富士康人力资源部人士对《华夏时报》记者如是说。“最近苹果的三个产品都进入量产，需要大量员工。”观澜区A1栋某员工告诉记者，可能只是因为订单突然增多，暂时缺人，所以招聘暑期工。富士康龙华CNSBG事业群某线长对本报记者否认是为内迁作准备：“如果只是培训，完全可以直接去内地已建好的厂培训，没必要花更大成本专门跑深圳来，流水线工作培训是件很简单的事，一看就会，一般一个星期就可以上岗操作。”富士康打什么算盘？疑云密布，富士康到底在想什么？“搞不懂富士康要干吗，观澜厂区A区苹果电脑生产线马上将搬往龙华厂区，最近晚上经常在运走机器，现在又要不断招人来，走一批，换一批。”富士康观澜厂区某办公室行政人员对记者说。“先安心工作，到搬的时候就搬。”龙华厂区G区某栋办公室员工告诉记者，因为之前他们对外传递了搬迁的去向，公司高层在内部发文彻查谁泄露了机密，表示要严惩，现在有什么动向，富士康也不再向员工透露。而公司第二波加薪潮考核日期从6月6日算起，考核三个月合格者，将底薪提高至2000元，但现在已经过去一个月，具体考核标准尚未出台，员工们对二次涨薪持怀疑态度，可能符合要求的没几个。富士康工会联合会人士告诉记者，目前正在制定详细考核标准，“富士康公布过会涨薪，就肯定会对合格的人兑现，不是信口开河。”富士康一边应付涨薪，一边忙招人来深圳，一边还要忙搬离深圳，种种动作着实看不懂。深圳大学产经研究中心主任魏达志对记者直言，“富士康现在就像一个小商贩在吆喝顾客，我要搬迁，你们快来抢吧。”这样形成一种热销的竞争效应，也让富士康有更多选择的筹码。魏达志认为，在工业化竞争中，沿海和内地发展阶段不同，深圳不需要富士康，内地有的城市如人口大省河南还是欢迎富士康这样能解决大量劳动力的企业。“但富士康的选择，主要是出于自身成本考虑，如果如外界所说，在河南给出的工资跟深圳一样，那富士康完全没有必要搬迁，媒体一窝蜂地宣传，刚好中了富士康下怀，这从河南先后传递出不同的虚假信息就知道。这是一个常识问题，很多人却想不清楚。”魏达志对记者说。	魏达志,陈小瑛,郭台铭	正向	"Foxconn, a large number of temporary workers in preparation for the relocation of the author/Chen Xiaoying, is trapped in the dilemma of salary increase and relocation. Recently, the reporter of Huaxia Times found in the Foxconn Guanlan plant that thousands of summer workers from schools in other places were flocking to participate in training. For this reason, Foxconn also took the initiative to pay a high price for the surrounding civilian houses of the factory, which were used as temporary employee dormitories. After investigation, the reporter learned that the college students who came to Foxconn in batches for training this time were obviously different from the people who were previously absorbed from society; In addition, all summer workers come from Henan Province. It is worth noting that Henan Province is the most popular destination for Foxconn's internal migration in recent days. Is Foxconn preparing for the relocation? At the moment when Guo Taiying came out to mobilize rumors of internal migration, there were few voices from Foxconn about internal migration, and its migration direction was more mysterious. In this regard, the reporter of this newspaper learned from many interviews that the various practices of Foxconn at this time point may be deliberately intended to create a situation of competition in inland areas in order to prepare for the relocation? On July 5, at the North Gate of the Guanlan Factory of Foxconn, a notice was posted at the gate of a farmer's building in a community called Runyuan, urging customers to move out because of special reasons, and residents must move out before July 15. Wang Xiaoqing, a Foxconn employee, told the reporter that he lived in Runyuan Community, a total of four buildings at the north gate of the factory. Recently, Foxconn has received many summer workers with no place to live, so Foxconn has taken the lead in providing them with a lot of expensive food and accommodation. The sudden sharp increase in rent is due to the sudden large number of summer workers recruited by Foxconn, but Foxconn has not made full preparations for the thousands of sudden summer workers. ""Many people who have just arrived can't arrange accommodation. Some people have slept on the ground for four days at the gate of Foxconn."" Wang Xiaoqing said to the reporter. The reporter learned from the Foxconn Guanlan Factory that all the summer workers who came here for internship were from Henan Province. After two or three months of internship, the workers who passed the examination and were willing to stay in Foxconn will be sent to factories in various places. The interns recruited by Foxconn also enjoy the same salary待遇as the workers, that is, the basic salary is 1200 yuan, and the overtime pay is calculated separately. ""Foxconn has posted job advertisements in streets and alleys in Zhengzhou, but I saw that the job location on the advertisement was not in Zhengzhou, but in Huai'an, Yantai and other places."" Local people in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, told the reporter that the Zhengzhou factory is not yet under construction. Several interns from He Nan came to Xiao Lu's dormitory to move to the production area of Apple's computer in the Guanlan factory of Foxconn. More than 1000 people came together from a school, and the contracts they signed were also short-term. After two months of training, those who have not graduated will go back to school first, and they don't know the specific destination. The reporter saw that there were still people coming to look for jobs at the South Gate of Foxconn Guanlan Factory, but Foxconn was short of people. It only recruited people from schools in a unified way and did not recruit people from the public in a unified way, which was quite incomprehensible. ""This is a unified strategy of the group, which is a decision made according to its own development needs. We don't know the specific reasons, but there is no problem in targeting a specific group of people for recruitment."" The human resources department of Foxconn said to the reporter of Huaxia Times. ""Recently, three products of Apple have entered mass production, which requires a large number of employees."" An employee of Building A1, Guanlan District, told the reporter that it was possible that the orders suddenly increased and there was a temporary shortage of people, so we should recruit summer workers. The line leader of the CNSBG business group of Foxconn Longhua denied that it was in preparation for the relocation: ""If it is just training, it is completely possible to go directly to the factory that has been built in the mainland for training. There is no need to go to Shenzhen at a higher cost. The training of assembly line workers is a very simple task. Once you see it, you can do it in a week."" What is Foxconn's intention? The clouds are thick. What is Foxconn thinking about? ""I don't understand what Foxconn is going to do. The Apple computer production line in Area A of Guanlan Factory is going to move to Longhua Factory soon. Recently, the machines are often moved away at night. Now, we need to keep recruiting people, and then change them."" An administrative staff of an office in the Guanlan factory of Foxconn said to the reporter. ""Work with peace of mind first, and move when it is moving."" An employee of an office building in Area G of Longhua Factory told the reporter that because they had previously communicated the direction of relocation to the public, the company's top management thoroughly investigated who leaked the secrets, indicating that they would be severely punished. Now, Foxconn no longer discloses any moves to the employees. The company's second wave of salary increase evaluation date starts from June 6. Those who pass the three month evaluation will increase their basic salary to 2000 yuan. However, it has been one month since now, and the specific evaluation criteria have not been issued, so the employees are skeptical about the salary increase for the second time, and there may be few people who meet the requirements. The Federation of Foxconn Trade Unions told the reporter that it is currently formulating a detailed evaluation criteria. ""Foxconn has announced that it will give a salary increase, and it will definitely give it to qualified people. It is not a big talk."" Foxconn is dealing with salary increase while busy recruiting people to come to Shenzhen, and it is also busy moving away from Shenzhen. It is really incomprehensible. Wei Dazhi, director of the Center for Production and Economic Research of Shenzhen University, frankly told the reporter, ""Foxconn is like a small vendor shouting at customers now. I want to move, so come on."" This also creates a competitive effect of best-selling, allowing Foxconn to have more choices. Wei Dazhi believes that the coastal areas and inland areas are in different development stages in the industrial competition. Shenzhen does not need Foxconn, and some inland cities, such as the populous province of Henan, still welcome enterprises like Foxconn that can solve a large number of labor. ""But the choice of Foxconn is mainly based on its own cost considerations. If, as the outside world said, the wages given in Henan Province are the same as those in Shenzhen, Foxconn has no need to relocate. The media are just in line with the wishes of Foxconn, which is just a coincidence from the different false information conveyed by Henan Province later. This is a common sense problem, but many people can't figure it out."" Wei Dazhi said to the reporter."
王挺《断箭》转型“八指老大”不惧《上海滩》新浪娱乐讯由海润影视出品的年代黑帮大戏《断箭》已于昨日在北京影视频道黄金档与观众见面，本剧由于融合了兄弟情、儿女情与家国情，再加上火爆的动作场面，使得一开播便广受关注。硬汉王挺在剧中饰演一个放荡不羁的上海滩黑帮老大“达文秀’，下足功夫的他不怕观众拿他跟荧屏经典《上海滩》中的角色比较。王挺演艺十年历程，《断箭》是转折从初为人知的《重案六组》丁箭，到激情燃烧的《战士》郑虎臣、再到广受好评的《兴国兴国》谢勋东，这些硬汉角色见证了王挺的成长。在这十余年间，他从一个演技稍显稚嫩的小伙子，逐渐成长为《断箭》中收放自如的黑帮老大达文秀，观众的认可背后，他付出了无数的努力和伤痛。在拍完《断箭》之后，王挺感慨说这是自己拍的最累的一部戏，因为剧中打斗、爆破的戏份太多。却也是自己人生中的一个转折点，因为这是他首次改变形象，扮演一个放荡不羁的黑帮老大，“当时所有的精力都放在了这个角色上，哪怕休息的时候我们都在讨论剧本，很少有闲聊的时候。”下足了功夫的王挺对这部戏充满信心，也希望能受到观众们的欢迎，看到他不同以往的一面。“八指老大”王挺不惧与“丁力”比拼提起上海滩的黑帮老大，最先想到的还是《上海滩》中的“丁力”，他桀骜不驯，亦正亦邪，是荧屏上的经典形象。而王挺此次在《断箭》中饰演的亦是一个黑帮老大，达文秀放荡不羁、带些痞气却为人仗义，凭借过人的胆量和出色的身手成长为上海滩第一帮派“龙帮”的灵魂人物。他从小混迹在动荡的旧上海滩，深知百姓疾苦，因此在看到日本人的残暴屠杀后，忍辱负重，“潜伏”进日本人的阵营中，暗地里却推动了上海滩抗日的浪潮，最后不幸被日本人剁掉了两根手指，成为了“八指老大”。与丁力相比，达文秀少了一丝精明，多了一份宽厚大度，他忧国忧民，不为外界诱惑所打动，甘愿默默承受所有人的误解，这种独特的人格魅力也吸引了众多美女的好感，名伶陆小青(陈德容(微博))，青梅竹马的龙美君(张定涵)都为他倾倒。相信达文秀这个八指老大，在经典面前也丝毫不会逊色。	王挺,陆小青,达文秀,丁力,谢勋东,陈德,陈德容	正向	"Wang Ting ""Eight Finger Boss"" transforms from ""Broken Arrow"" and is not afraid of ""Shanghai Beach"". Sina Entertainment News, the age gangster drama ""Broken Arrow"" produced by Hairun Film and Television has met the audience in the gold file of Beijing Film and Television Channel yesterday. This play has been widely concerned since its broadcast because it combines brotherhood, children's love and family love with the火爆action scene. Wang Ting plays a dissolute Shanghai gang boss ""Dawenxiu"" in the play. He is not afraid that the audience will compare him with the role in the classic film ""Shanghai Beach"". Wang Ting's ten year acting career, ""Broken Arrow"" is a turning point from the first known heavy case group Ding Arrow to the passionate ""Warrior"" Zheng Hu Chen and then to the well received ""Xingguo Xingguo"" Xie Xun Dong. These tough guys roles have witnessed the growth of Wang Ting. In these more than ten years, he has grown from a young man who is slightly naive in acting to a free and easy gang boss Dawenxiu in ""Broken Arrow"". Behind the audience's recognition, he has made countless efforts and pains. After finishing the movie ""Broken Arrow"", Wang Ting said that this was the most tiring movie he had ever shot, because there were too many fighting and bombing scenes in the movie. But it was also a turning point in his life, because it was the first time for him to change his image and play a dissolute gang boss. ""At that time, all the energy was focused on this role. Even when we were resting, we were discussing the script. There was rarely any idleness."" Wang Ting, who has made enough efforts, is full of confidence in this play, and hopes to win the welcome of the audience and see his different side. ""Eight Finger Boss"" Wang Ting is not afraid to compete with ""Ding Li"" to mention the boss of the gangsters in Shanghai Beach. The first thing that comes to mind is still ""Ding Li"" in Shanghai Beach. He is so arrogant and unscrupulous that he is a classic image on the screen. However, Wang Ting also plays a gang boss in ""Broken Arrow"", and Dawenxiu is dissolute and has some痞but righteous spirit. With his courage and excellent skills, he grows into the soul figure of the first gang ""Dragon Gang"" in Shanghai Beach. He grew up in the turbulent old Shanghai Beach, knowing that the people were suffering. Therefore, after seeing the brutal massacre of the Japanese, he endured humiliation and ""hid"" into the Japanese army, but secretly promoted the anti Japanese tide in Shanghai Beach. Unfortunately, he was chopped off two fingers by the Japanese and became the ""Eight Finger Boss"". Compared with Ding Li, Da Wenxiu has less smartness and more generosity. He is worried about the country and the people. He is not moved by the temptation of the outside world. He is willing to silently bear everyone's misunderstanding. This unique personal charm has also attracted the goodwill of many beauties. Lu Xiaoqing (Chen Derong (microblog)), a famous actress, and Long Meijun (Zhang Dinghan), a childhood sweetheart, have all fallen for him. I believe that Dawenxiu, the eight finger leader, will not be inferior in the face of classics."
世锦赛-陈一冰吊环15.800分强势卫冕荣膺4冠王新浪体育讯　北京时间10月15日下午15点10分，在日本东京举行的2011年世界体操锦标赛结束了单项男子吊环决赛的争夺，中国选手陈一冰(微博)以15.800分获得男子吊环冠军，这是他第四次获得世界锦标赛男子吊环冠军。巴西选手纳巴雷特以15.600分获得亚军，日本选手山室光史以15.500分获得第三名。内村航平第一个出场，他的难度不算高，正常发挥应该能顺利完成，但看来他的体力消耗实在巨大，在做最后一个水平十字时失败，差点掉下器械，最后他得到14.633分。陈一冰第二位出场，上来就是直角十字、水平十字、倒十字，三个十字稳稳到位！充分展示力量感的压上成十字，压上成倒十字，后摆上成水平十字，吊环王陈一冰给出教科书般的完美展示，最后720旋下纹丝不动，15.800，E分打到9.000！第三位出场的是巴西人纳巴雷特-扎内，预赛仅仅排在陈一冰之后，他的力量运用得很惊人，几个十字做得都很非常标准，静止时间也没问题，但在做分腿水平支撑不到位，他得到了15.600分。接着出场的美国选手霍顿，水平显然不是夺牌热门行列的，而且今年不太好的状态延续到了本场比赛上，难度不高的动作都没到位，他得到了14.300分。解禁复出的荷兰名将范格尔德第五位出场，他难度同样很高，开场的几个非常消耗体力的十字做得很到位，但越到后面越显得不那么自如，后摆上成水平就有些勉强，下法前屈两周下可惜坐在地上，他得到了14.666分。意大利老将莫兰迪接着出场，他和范格尔德一样，前面有力量感的十字都很出色，但到后半段体力有点跟不住，终于在最后下法前没有做到静止，尽管直体旋站住，他也只得到了15.200分。委内瑞拉选手卡尔莫纳难度不算大，但完成的总不那么到位，下法更是前冲趴在地上，他得到了14.266分。山室光史最后出场，他的表现还是不错，水平十字、直角十字和倒十字也很到位前屈两周成水平十字静止时间也足够，直体旋下往后退了一小步，这套难度分比陈一冰要低一些，他得到了15.500分，陈一冰毫无悬念的收获金牌！(威猛)	山室光史,内村航平,莫兰迪,霍顿,纳巴雷特,卡尔莫纳,陈一冰,范格尔德	正向	World Championships-S Chen Yibing defends his title as the king of four championships with a score of 15.800 in the men's rings. Sina Sports News At 15:10 on October 15, Beijing time, the 2011 World Gymnastics Championships held in Tokyo, Japan ended the competition for the men's rings finals. Chen Yibing (microblog) of China won the men's rings championship with a score of 15.800. This is his fourth time to win the men's rings championship of the World Championships. The Brazilian player Nabarette scored 15.600 points to win the runner-up, and the Japanese player Shanshi Guangshi scored 15.500 points to win the third place. Nai Cunhangping was the first to play. His difficulty was not high. He should be able to complete it if he played normally. But it seems that his physical energy consumption is really huge. He failed to do the last horizontal cross and almost fell down. Finally, he got 14.633 points. Chen Yibing came out second, with a straight cross, a horizontal cross and an inverted cross. Three crosses are steady! Pressing into a cross to fully demonstrate the sense of power, pressing into an inverted cross, and then swinging into a horizontal cross, Chen Yibing, the king of the rings, gave a textbook perfect demonstration. At last, the 720 spin went down without moving, 15.800, E score hit 9.000! The third player was Nabarette Zane of Brazil, who only ranked second to Chen Yibing in the preliminary round. His power was amazing. Several crosses were very standard, and there was no problem with the static time, but the leg separation level support was not in place, and he scored 15.600 points. Horton, the next American player, is obviously not a favorite in the medal race, and this year's bad status has continued to this game. The action with low difficulty is not in place. He scored 14.300. The fifth Dutch star Van Geld, who was released from the ban, also played. His difficulty was equally high, and the very tiring cross at the beginning was well done. But the less free he was, the less comfortable he became. It was a pity that he sat on the ground. He got 14.666 points. Morandi, the Italian veteran, played next. Like Van Geld, he had excellent crosses with a sense of power in the front, but his physical strength didn't follow in the second half. Finally, he didn't do well before the last move. Although he stood in a straight body, he only got 15.200 points. The Venezuelan player Carmona is not very difficult, but he never gets it right. He rushes forward and falls to the ground. He gets 14.266 points. Shanshi Guangshi was the last to play, and his performance was still good. The horizontal cross, the right angle cross and the inverted cross were also in place. The forward flexing for two weeks was also enough. The straight body spin took a small step back. This set of difficulty scores was lower than Chen Yibing, and he got 15.500 points. Chen Yibing won the gold medal without surprise! (Weimeng)

The netizens named the vice county magistrate Gao Yong, who was ""raging, rude and slamming the door"", as ""Brother Door Slamming"" and ""The Most Unstable Vice County Magistrate"", and showed great concern about whether the relevant officials had been disciplined. On April 1, Hongwang reporters dialed a number of units, including the Discipline Inspection Commission of Jilin Province and the Soft Environment Office. It is reported that Songyuan City has filed a case against Vice County Magistrate Gao Yong and others involved in this matter, and the official results will be announced at the first time. Jilin Provincial Soft Environment Office: 8 people have been investigated. The Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province confirmed that because the county government was not honest and inefficient during the investment of Jilin Dekka Company in Fuyu County, it affected the project construction of the enterprise and caused considerable losses. The Soft Environment Office of the province has ordered the Discipline Inspection Commission of Songyuan City to investigate and deal with it. Songyuan City has filed a case against Vice County Magistrate Gao Yong and other 8 people involved in this matter, and has given them serious warnings, administrative demerits and demerits respectively. At the same time, the staff of the complaint center of the Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervision Bureau of Songyuan City's economic development soft environment confirmed that the Discipline Inspection Commission of Songyuan City has indeed filed a case against Gao Yong and others according to the requirements of the Discipline Inspection Commission and the Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province, and has reported the proposed results to the Discipline Inspection Commission and the Soft Environment Office of Jilin Province. As for the specific 8 people who have been investigated and will be punished, the staff said ""The investigation of the disciplinary committee has not been published yet, it is temporarily confidential. It will be published at the first time after the formal processing results come out."". He also said that the municipal Discipline Inspection Commission of Songyuan City had intervened in the land dispute between De Card Group and Fuyu County Government for many times. At present, Fuyu County Government is still negotiating with De Card Group. According to the report of Jilin New Culture News, Xu Jie, the party secretary of Fuyu County, who was exposed by Jilin Television in November 2010, ""has only come for more than three years"" and was called ""regardless of affairs"" by netizens. He has been elected as the deputy director of Songyuan Municipal People's Congress on January 14, 2011. A message on the website of Fuyu County Government also shows that Xu Jie's current job is ""Deputy Director of Songyuan Municipal People's Congress and Secretary of Fuyu County Party Committee"". In the news of ""My County's New Rural Construction Work Conference"" on March 22 on the website of Fuyu County Government, Liu Shulin, a member of the standing committee of the county party committee and director of the office of the county party committee, who was ""full of alcohol"", still hosted the ""new rural construction work conference"" in his original position. As for the vice county magistrate Gao Yong, who ""raged, swore and slammed the door"", the government website shows that he is still among the county leaders, and his duty is ""to assist the county mayor in charge of the Transport Bureau, the Construction Bureau, the Urban Development and Construction Management Office, the Urban Comprehensive Law Enforcement Office, the Population and Family Planning Bureau, the Radio, Television and Administration Bureau, and the Radio and Television Network Company"". Later, in order to understand the progress of the land dispute between Dekka Group and Fuyu County Government, the reporter dialed the ""County Mayor's Public Telephone (0438-5862345)"" in Fuyu County to try to contact the relevant responsible person, but no one answered the phone. 【Another news】 The treatment results of Vice County Magistrate Gao Yong and other people in Fuyu County were announced, and 4 people were dismissed. Hongwang News on April 1 (Reporter Liu Can) At 19:35 on April 1, Hongwang reporters once again connected with the Discipline Inspection Commission of Jilin Province and the Provincial Soft Environment Office. A leader of the Discipline Inspection Commission of Jilin Province confirmed to the reporter that in view of the inaction of the deputy county magistrate of Fuyu County and other people, the Standing Committee of the Discipline Inspection Commission of Songyuan City has decided to give Gao Yong, the deputy county magistrate of Fuyu County, a serious warning and an administrative demerit; Liu Changwen, the director of the Housing and Construction Bureau of the County, was given a disciplinary demerit and an administrative demerit; Li Chunhui, the director of the Health Bureau of the County, was given a disciplinary demerit and an administrative demerit; Ju Dianying, the director of the Land Bureau of the County, was given a major disciplinary demerit; Zhou Guangxin, the former secretary of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee and the current Director of the Xincheng Bureau of Songyuan City Agricultural Hi tech Development Zone Administration Committee, was given a disciplinary warning; Zhou Zhongyou, the director of the Planning Department of the Housing and Construction Bureau of the County, was given an administrative demerit; Wang Baowen, the director of the Cultivation and Protection Department of the Land Bureau of the County, was given an administrative demerit. He also revealed that at the provincial video conference on the rectification and construction of economic development soft environment held on March 30, the case had been reported to the whole province, and today it was officially released to the media. He said, ""The Jilin Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and netizens have the same feelings, hoping to deal with this kind of behavior severely. In the future, the disciplinary committee will further increase the intensity of investigation and punishment."" With regard to the question of netizens about Liu Shulin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Fuyu County Committee and Director of the Office of the County Committee, drinking during working hours, the official said that the local authorities of Fuyu County had made corresponding arrangements."

奥巴马同父异母弟弟涉嫌持有大麻被捕中新网1月31日电美国媒体报导，肯尼亚警方今天表示，美国总统奥巴马(BarackObama)的同父异母弟弟乔治•奥巴马(GeorgeObama)，遭肯尼亚警方逮捕，罪名是持有大麻。“中央社”引述CNN消息称，巡官穆特姆贝是负责本案的警官。穆特姆贝说，乔治因涉嫌持有大麻被捕，且当时曾拒捕，预定2月2日出庭。报导指出，乔治目前被拘押在肯尼亚首都奈洛比(Nairobi)的胡鲁马(Huruma)警局。CNN记者前往牢房与他交谈，乔治否认这类指控。他说：“他们把我从家里带走。我不知道他们为何要起诉我。”虽然乔治与奥巴马曾见过面，但彼此几乎不认识对方。在奥巴马的近亲当中，只有极少数未参加上周在华盛顿举行的总统就职典礼，乔治就是其中之一。报导指出，奥巴马在回忆录“奥巴马的梦想之路——以父之名”(DreamsfromMyFather)中描述说，认识乔治是件“痛苦的事”。奥巴马的肯尼亚之行，是为了会晤从未谋面的亲人。报导说，乔治与奥巴马两人同父异母。奥巴马在回忆录写道，他力求修补与父亲的关系。奥巴马的父亲在他童年时期就离开他与母亲。奥巴马的父亲在车祸中丧生，当年乔治才6个月大。乔治和奥巴马一样，对父亲几乎一无所知。	乔治,穆特姆贝,奥巴马	负向	"Barack Obama's half brother Obama was arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana, chinanews. com, January 31. The US media reported that the Kenyan police said today that Barack Obama's half brother George Obama was arrested by the Kenyan police on the charge of possession of marijuana. CNA quoted CNN as saying that Mutumbe, the patrol officer in charge of this case, said that George was arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana and had refused to arrest him. He was scheduled to appear in court on February 2. The report pointed out that George is currently detained in Huruma police station, the capital of Kenya, Nairobi. CNN reporters went to the prison to talk with him, and George denied such accusations. He said: ""They took me away from home. I don't know why they want to prosecute me."" Although George and Obama have met, they hardly know each other. Among Obama's close relatives, only a few people did not attend the presidential inauguration held in Washington last week, and George was one of them. The report pointed out that Obama described in his memoir ""Obama's Dream Road - In the Name of Father"" that it was ""painful"" to know George. Obama's trip to Kenya was to meet his relatives for the first time. The report said that George and Obama were half brothers. Obama wrote in his memoirs that he tried to repair his relationship with his father. Obama's father left him and his mother in his childhood. Obama's father died in a car accident when George was only 6 months old. Like Obama, George knew almost nothing about his father."
美的精英赛斯科特65杆领先高杰刘俊峰落后两杆新浪体育讯　北京时间10月15日，澳大利亚大炮克雷格-斯科特(CraigScott)第一天打顺德君兰国际高尔夫俱乐部，便打出65杆，低于标准杆6杆，取得了美的中国精英赛首轮领先。中国选手高杰与刘俊峰表现也不错，分别打出67杆，低于标准杆4杆，位于并列第四位。克雷格-斯科特由于护照出了问题，直到星期三下午5点才来到顺德。他开了一个球车在球场上转了一圈，就相当于练习了。星期四在完全盲打的情况下，澳大利亚人抓到5只小鸟，射下1头老鹰，虽然在第五洞四杆洞吞下了柏忌，最终就力压爱尔兰选手艾迪-巴尔(EddieBarr)和澳大利亚选手布拉德-麦克因托什(BradMcIntosh)取得了领先。后边这两位选手在第一轮交出66杆，低于标准杆5杆。2003年美国公开赛亚军斯特芬-林尼(StephenLeaney)今天的开局和收尾很不错，前三个洞打出低于标准杆4杆，而最后两个洞连抓两只小鸟结束。可是他中间出现了一个双柏忌和一个柏忌，最终交出67杆，与中国选手高杰、刘俊峰、韩国选手成始雨(SeaWooSung)一起位于并列第四位。“或许不看球场还好一些。”在加拿大巡回赛上征战四年的克雷格-斯科特半开玩笑地说，“你不看球场，不知道危险在哪里。”其实克雷格-斯科特在君兰打得好的真正原因是他的长杆发挥不错。在澳大利亚巡回赛上，他是发球距离排名前三位的球手。星期四，球场虽然不怎么滚动，他的发球距离也有290到295码。当然这些球能停在球道上也是关键。克雷格-斯科特今天只有一次发球没有上球道。另外，他还有一个颇有运气的球。在第15洞三杆洞，他开球开到果岭后方，距离旗杆大约有10码。他一切进洞便抓到了小鸟。开球距离长在君兰国际高尔夫俱乐部总是会有优势的。克雷格-斯科特的同胞布拉德-麦克因托什一早打出66杆之后也表达了相似的意思。该选手今天抓到9只小鸟，但是也吞下了4个柏忌。曾经在澳大利亚赢得两场比赛的布拉德-麦克因托什说：“这一轮蛮起伏的，有许多小鸟，也有许多柏忌，但不是发球过猛的原因。柏忌主要是因为短杆不好，出现了一些三推。”开球的强项也让刘俊峰处于前列。作为中巡赛唯一一个拿下双鹰的选手，刘俊峰今天抓到了6只小鸟，吞下2个柏忌。河南洛阳选手高杰也是这种观点，他甚至觉得这个球场比较短。29岁选手今年在珠海金湾的职业考试中刚刚获得职业资格，他说：“这个成绩很好，可我还有几个小鸟没有拿下，要不然会更好。”张连伟71杆，平标准杆，吴阿顺70杆，低于标准杆1杆，而梁文冲打出69杆，低于标准杆2杆。“今天我的铁杆小左曲，而木杆又是小右曲。这让我无法靠近旗杆，这是我小鸟球机会不太多的原因。”梁文冲说，“另外，练习果岭与实际的果岭速度不一样，所以在短推的力道上也没有掌握好。可是总体来说，我现在的状态不错。”梁文冲刚刚从日巡赛归来。他在亚巡赛和日巡赛联合举办的亚太公开赛上获得了亚军，而上一周的佳能公开赛，要不是第一轮打出74杆的话，他完全能获得一个前十名。那场因为恶劣天气而削减为三轮的比赛，他最终获得了并列第17名。点击浏览详细成绩>>(小风)	斯特芬-林尼,布拉德-麦克因托什,梁文冲,成始雨,刘进峰,刘俊峰,艾迪-巴尔,克雷格-斯科特,斯科特,张连伟,小风,高杰,吴阿顺	正向	"At the US Open in 2003, the runner up, Stephen Leaney (Stephen Leaney), had a very good start and ending today. He played three holes under par, and ended with two consecutive birdies in the last two holes. However, he had a double bogey and a bogey in the middle, and finally handed in 67 strokes, together with Chinese players Gao Jie, Liu Junfeng and South Korean player Cheng Siyu (Sea Woo Sung), tied for fourth place. ""Maybe it's better not to see the golf course."" Craig Scott, who has played in the Canadian Tour for four years, said jokingly. ""If you don't see the golf course, you don't know where the danger is."" In fact, the real reason why Craig Scott played well in Junlan is that his long shot is good. On the Australian Tour, he is one of the top three players in terms of serving distance. On Thursday, although the court did not roll much, his serving distance was 290 to 295 yards. Of course, the key is that these balls can stop on the fairway. Craig Scott only served once today without going up the fairway. In addition, he had another ball of luck. At the 15th hole, the three rod hole, he hit the ball to the back of the green, about 10 yards from the flagstick. He made a birdie by hitting a hole in one. The long serving distance always has advantages in Junlan International Golf Club. Craig Scott's compatriot Brad McIntosh also expressed a similar meaning after he made 66 shots early this morning. The player caught nine birds today, but also swallowed four bogies. Brad McIntosh, who has won two games in Australia, said: ""This round is very ups and downs, with many small birds and many bogies, but it is not the reason why the serve is too fierce. Bogey mainly results from poor short shots, and there are some three pushes."" Liu Junfeng, who is also a strong point in serving, is also in the lead. As the only player in the China Tour who has won a double eagle, Liu Junfeng caught 6 birds and swallowed 2 bogeys today. Gao Jie, a contestant from Luoyang, Henan Province, also shares this view, and he even thinks that the golf course is short. The 29 year old player just obtained the professional qualification in the professional examination in Zhuhai Jinwan this year, and said: ""The result is good, but I still have some birds that I haven't won, otherwise it will be better."" Zhang Lianwei scored 71 points, level par, and Wu Aishun scored 70 points, one par lower than the par. Liang Wenchong made 69 shots, 2 shots lower than the par. ""Today, my iron is small to the left, and my wood is small to the right. This makes me unable to get close to the flagstick, which is the reason why I have few opportunities for birdie balls."" Said Liang Wenchong, ""In addition, the speed of the practice green is different from that of the actual green, so I didn't get the strength right on the short push. But in general, I am in good condition now."" Liang Wenchong has just returned from the Japanese Tour. He won the runner up in the Asia Pacific Open co sponsored by the Asian Tour and the Japanese Tour, and in the Canon Open last week, if he had not made 74 shots in the first round, he would have been able to get a top ten. The game was cut to three rounds because of the bad weather, and he eventually finished tied for 17th place. Click to view detailed results>> (Breeze)"

皇马相中西班牙国脚价值3600万世界杯他比托雷斯管用新浪体育讯　据西班牙马卡电台记者埃斯特拉达披露，皇马对现效力于毕尔巴鄂竞技的西班牙国脚前锋洛伦特非常感兴趣。埃斯特拉达在其专栏中透露：自从穆里尼奥来到皇家马德里之后，他的重点引进目标之一就一直是一名前锋。尽管皇马队内已经拥有像伊瓜因和克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多这样的攻击球员，但穆里尼奥想要的是一名风格不同的射手，他希望皇马高层能引进一名善于在禁区内打破僵局的强力中锋。此前已有媒体猜测皇马对拜仁慕尼黑的马里奥·戈麦斯和尤文图斯的阿毛里感兴趣，但穆里尼奥真正提到名字的人却是效力于毕尔巴鄂竞技的费尔南多·略伦特。略伦特拥有了穆里尼奥要求的一切条件：他头球好，双脚技术出色，跑动意识好，善于牵扯对方中卫的防守。此外，略伦特还拥有丰富的大赛经验，西班牙队夺得南非世界杯冠军，其中也有他的功劳。穆里尼奥希望略伦特尽快加盟，以便彻底完善皇马的球员结构。随着中场赫迪拉的到来以及皇马在边后卫位置上的操作，略伦特很可能是最终使球队完整的意外引进。不过，交易能否达成还必须要看略伦特本人以及毕尔巴鄂竞技方面的立场。略伦特的违约金在3600万欧元左右，很多球队都已经打听过他的情况。(KKGonzalez)	穆里尼奥,埃斯特拉达,克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多,托雷斯,洛伦特,阿毛里,略伦特,伊瓜因,马里奥,KKGonzalez,赫迪拉,戈麦斯	正向	Real Madrid has targeted the 36 million Spanish international World Cup, which is more useful than Torres Sina Sports News According to Estrada, a reporter from Real Madrid's Marca Radio in Spain, Real Madrid is very interested in Fernando Llorente, a Spanish international forward who is now playing for Athletic Bilbao. Estrada revealed in his column that since Mourinho came to Real Madrid, one of his key introduction targets has always been a forward. Although Real Madrid has attack players such as Higuain and Cristiano Ronaldo, Mourinho wants a different style of shooter, and he hopes that the senior management of Real Madrid can introduce a powerful center who is good at breaking the deadlock in the restricted area. Previously, the media speculated that Real Madrid was interested in Mario Gomez of Bayern Munich and Amouri of Juventus, but the person Mourinho really mentioned was Fernando Llorente, who played for Athletic Bilbao. Llorente has everything Mourinho requires: he has a good header, good feet skills, good running sense, and is good at pulling the other side's central defender's defense. In addition, Llorente also has rich experience in major events. The Spanish team won the South Africa World Cup championship, which also contributed to him. Mourinho hopes that Llorente can join as soon as possible in order to improve the player structure of Real Madrid completely. With the arrival of Khedira in the midfield and the operation of Real Madrid in the position of wing back, Llorente may be the unexpected introduction that eventually makes the team complete. However, whether the deal can be reached still depends on Llorente himself and the position of Athletic Bilbao. Llorente's breach of contract is around 36 million euros, and many teams have asked about his situation. (KKGonzalez)

黄培昭：巴以滥施武力事与愿违作者：黄培昭在经历了为期半年的相对平静之后，巴以重新爆发冲突。27日，以色列出动战斗机和武装直升机空袭加沙，目前已有包括巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动(哈马斯)高级军事官员在内的1000多人死伤。以色列何以对哈马斯大打出手？中东媒体分析认为，以色列主要出于三方面的考虑。一是报复哈马斯的火箭袭击。今年6月，以哈马斯为主的加沙巴勒斯坦派别与以色列达成为期半年的停火协议，协议至12月中旬到期。由此，巴以间的冲突开始升温。以色列军方说，自18日以来，哈马斯已向以色列境内发射了数百枚火箭。为此，以色列必须进行还击，以打击“恐怖主义”的“嚣张气焰”。二是出于国内政治的需要。明年初，以色列将举行大选。现在竞争态势激烈。利库德集团主席内塔尼亚胡等一直指责政府“软弱”，前进党党内不少人也认为奥尔默特“无能”，奥尔默特面临极大的压力。以当局大举空袭加沙，是各方压力的结果，只有这样，奥尔默特才能战败利库德集团等其它党派的竞争而赢得大选，否则就会像民调显示的那样，在明年初的选举中失利。三是以色列利用了美国政坛权力交接的真空。现在，总统布什卸任在即，当选总统奥巴马还没上任，以色列认为这一特殊时期是对哈马斯发动攻击的最佳时机。24日，以色列内阁开会，批准以国防军对哈马斯的军、政目标实施打击。以色列这一次采取了惯用的“闪电战”战术，各机种几乎在同一时间内协同作战，向加沙的近50处目标进行狂轰滥炸，造成重大伤亡。不过，从实际效果看，以色列要达到消灭哈马斯的目标很难实现。首先，如此大的伤亡必然引起国际社会的强烈不满和谴责，一些阿拉伯国家也要求召开紧急首脑会议讨论形势，报道称，阿拉伯国家联盟将在两天内举行紧急会议研究对策。其次，在伤亡面前，哈马斯会空前团结，并赢得更多的人心和支持者，这样，就与以色列的初衷事与愿违。事后，哈马斯发表声明，呼吁其手下军事人员及支持者以各种手段对以色列发起最猛烈的报复行动，哈马斯成员群情激昂，纷纷发誓要对以色列“以牙还牙”，让以色列变成“血的地狱”。连主流的巴民族解放运动(法塔赫)也站在哈马斯一边，对哈马斯受袭击并遭到沉重打击进行声援。巴临时政府宣布为期3天的“哀悼日”，悼念在以军空袭中丧生的巴勒斯坦人。当然，更严重的是，如果恶化局势，甚至失控，巴以将重新坠入暴力循环的怪圈，彻底断送中东和平进程。巴以冲突已经成为中东局势的“沉疴痼疾”，眼下，冲突的势头再度凸显，事态的发展令人担忧。实践证明，武力绝不是化解矛盾的办法，只有通过谈判实现和平，才是解决一切问题的真正出路。	奥巴马,奥尔默特,布什,黄培昭,内塔尼亚胡	负向	"Huang Peizhao: The authors of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, who have experienced a relatively peaceful period of six months, have resumed their conflict. On the 27th, Israel sent fighters and armed helicopters to launch an air raid on Gaza, and more than 1000 people, including Hamas military officials of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, were killed or wounded. Why did Israel attack Hamas? The media in the Middle East analyzed that Israel mainly considered three aspects. One is to retaliate against Hamas' rocket attacks. In June this year, the Palestinian factions in Gaza, mainly Hamas, reached a six-month ceasefire agreement with Israel, which expired in mid December. As a result, the conflict between Palestine and Israel began to escalate. The Israeli military said that since the 18th, Hamas had launched hundreds of rockets into Israel. As a result, Israel must retaliate to fight the ""arrogant spirit"" of ""terrorism"". Second, it is necessary for domestic politics. Early next year, Israel will hold general elections. Now the competition situation is fierce. Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud Group, and many other people in the forward party have been accusing the government of ""weakness"", and Olmert is under great pressure. The large-scale air raid on Gaza by the Israeli authorities is the result of pressure from all parties, and only in this way can Olmert defeat the competition of other parties such as the Likud Group and win the election, otherwise, as the public opinion polls show, he will lose the election in the early January. Third, Israel has taken advantage of the vacuum of power transition in the US political arena. Now, President Bush is going to retire and President Obama has not yet taken office. Israel believes that this special period is the best time to attack Hamas. On the 24th, the Israeli cabinet held a meeting to approve the Israeli Defense Forces to attack Hamas' military and political goals. This time, Israel adopted the usual ""lightning war"" tactic. All aircraft almost fought in coordination at the same time, and launched a massive bombing of nearly 50 targets in Gaza, causing heavy casualties. However, in terms of actual results, it is difficult for Israel to achieve the goal of eliminating Hamas. First of all, such casualties will inevitably cause strong dissatisfaction and condemnation from the international community, and some Arab countries also require an emergency summit to discuss the situation. It is reported that the Arab League will hold an emergency meeting within two days to study countermeasures. Secondly, in the face of casualties, Hamas will be unprecedentedly united, winning more hearts and supporters, which will go against the wishes of Israel. Later, Hamas issued a statement, calling on its military personnel and supporters to launch the most fierce retaliatory actions against Israel in various ways. Hamas members were so enthusiastic that they vowed to ""pay back their teeth"" to Israel and make it a ""hell of blood"". Even the mainstream Palestinian National Liberation Movement (Fatah) also stands on the side of Hamas to support Hamas in its attack and heavy blow. The Palestinian interim government announced a three-day ""day of mourning"" to mourn the Palestinians who died in the Israeli air raid. Of course, more seriously, if the situation worsens or even loses control, Palestine and Israel will fall back into the vicious circle of violence, completely sacrificing the peace process in the Middle East. The Israeli Palestinian conflict has become a ""chronic disease"" in the Middle East. At present, the conflict is once again highlighted, and the development of events is worrying.

张柏芝新公司发声明：只要抚养权欲告查小欣成都商报讯(记者陈玲莉)继刘若英(微博)发布结婚声明，范冰冰发布“被怀孕”声明后，新近签约新东家AEG新亚洲娱乐联盟集团的张柏芝昨日也凑热闹，委托新东家发了一份声明，声明中称近日对其离婚事件进行报道的香港《明报周刊》和《东方新地》存在失实报道，要追究法律责任。这位新东家的老总余毓兴还很牛气地表示，公司也将同时追究香港主持人查小欣爆料离婚事件的法律责任，还张柏芝一个清白。8月6日见报的《明报周刊》这篇被称为失实的报道中称，“知情人透露，张柏芝并非甘愿一毛不拿，她不仅要两个儿子的抚养权，更详列谢霆锋22亿元台币的家产清单，逐项平分。”对于这一说法，余毓兴表示存在失实之处，人在剧组拍摄的张柏芝委托公司对外表明态度，“只想要两个儿子的抚养权，并不想拿走谢霆锋一分一毛钱，自己有足够的经济能力养好两个儿子。”而香港英皇旗下的《东方新地》近日则刊登了一张Lucas哭喊的图片，称“Lucas不要和张柏芝一起住要和谢霆锋回家”，这篇报道也遭到新亚洲娱乐的斥责，余毓兴表示，经过张柏芝的授权，公司将向《东方新地》发出律师函。	张柏芝,余毓兴,查小欣,陈玲莉,Lucas,刘若英,谢霆锋	正向	"Zhang's new company issued a statement: He wanted to sue Xiaoxin Chengdu Commercial News (Chen Lingli) After Liu Rong (microblog) issued a marriage statement and Fan Bingbing issued a ""pregnant"" statement, Zhang Ziyi, who recently signed a contract with the new owner AEG Asia Entertainment Alliance Group, also joined in the fun yesterday, entrusting the new owner to issue a statement, which said that the Hong Kong ""Ming Bao Weekly"" and ""Oriental New Land"", which recently reported on his divorce, were false, and he wanted to pursue legal responsibility. Yu Yuxing, the boss of the new owner, also said domineeringly that the company will also pursue the legal responsibility of Hong Kong host Xiaoxin for exposing the divorce, and restore Zhang's innocence. The false report of the Ming Bao Weekly, which was published on August 6 and was called false, said, ""The informed source revealed that Cecilia Cheung was not willing to give up a single hair. She wanted not only the custody of her two children, but also listed Xiao Feng's family property list of 2.2 billion Taiwan dollars, and shared it item by item."" For this statement, Yu Yuxing said that there were false statements. Cecilia Cheung, who was shooting in the crew, asked the company to show her attitude to the outside world, ""I just want the custody of my two children, and I don't want to take a penny away from Xiao Feng. I have enough economic ability to raise my two children well.""

今年IPO募资下降近八成王锦据统计，包括上海电气不筹资IPO在内，今年以来共有77家公司通过IPO亮相沪深两市。除上海电气外的76家公司共募集资金约1034亿元，平均发行市盈率27倍。由于股市深幅调整，今年IPO发行同比大幅缩水，IPO家数与2007年的123家相比减少38%，募集资金总额与2007年的4770亿元相比减少78%。除发行节奏大幅放缓外，今年以来大盘股IPO寥寥无几，仅5家公司发行数量在5亿股以上，占IPO总家数的6%，而去年该比例为17%。不过，大盘股仍扮演了主要融资角色。这5家公司共募集资金733亿元，占今年IPO募资总额的70%。今年IPO公司中，中煤能源募资金额最高，达256亿元；中国南车发行股份数量最大，为30亿股。尽管12月份尚余13个交易日，但业内人士估计，年内重启IPO的可能性非常小。民族证券策略分析师表示，目前市场融资功能完全取决于市场好坏。如果有跨年度行情，明年1月份或一季度可能会有一些中小板IPO试探性出来。不过，日信证券首席策略分析师徐海洋表示，目前市场环境不具备重启IPO的条件，至少3个月内看不到IPO开闸的希望。国金证券策略研究员徐炜也表示，重启IPO最早可能要到明年一季度末二季度初，管理层会更多考虑市场情况。上海QDII募集规模比上季下降近7成□记者钱妤晚报讯相对于信托类和债券以及货币市场工具类理财产品的继续稳健增长，上海市场的结构性理财产品和QDII业务募集规模下降，分别比上季下降33.61%和64.58%。尤其是中小型银行，上述两类业务的募集金额下降最为显著。上海银监局昨日发布的《2008年第三季度个人理财业务分析报告》显示，截至2008年9月末，上海市场个人理财产品余额为1342.26亿元，比上季末增长25.47%，比去年同期增长64.62%；共募集资金1356.20亿元，比上季增长5.14%，比去年同期增长74.35%。三季度，上海市场商业银行个人理财业务以人民币理财业务为主导的市场格局特点更加显著。三季度共募集人民币理财产品1271.57亿元，占到理财产品募集总量的91.7%。人民币理财业务集中于信托理财和债券及货币市场工具类的理财产品，两类理财产品募集资金总量分别为604.66亿元和573.56亿元，占比分别达到44.58%和42.29%。	钱妤,王锦,徐海洋,徐炜	负向	The statistics of Wang Jin, including the non fund raising IPO of Shanghai Electric, showed that a total of 77 companies had appeared in Shanghai and Shenzhen through IPO since this year. 76 companies other than Shanghai Electric raised a total of 103.4 billion yuan, with an average issuance price earnings ratio of 27 times. Due to the deep adjustment of the stock market, this year's IPO issuance shrank significantly compared with the same period last year, the number of IPOs decreased by 38% compared with 123 in 2007, and the total funds raised decreased by 78% compared with 477 billion yuan in 2007. In addition to the sharp slowdown in the issuance pace, there were few large-cap IPOs in Shanghai since this year. Only 5 companies issued more than 500 million shares, accounting for 6% of the total number of IPOs, while the proportion last year was 17%. However, large-cap stocks still play a major role in financing. These five companies raised a total of 73.3 billion yuan, accounting for 70% of the total IPO funds raised this year. Among the IPO companies this year, China Coal Energy raised the highest amount of money, up to 25.6 billion yuan; China South Locomotive issued the largest number of shares, 3 billion shares. Although there are still 13 trading days in December, industry insiders estimate that the possibility of restarting IPO within the year is very small. The national securities strategy analyst said that the current market financing function is entirely dependent on the market. If there is a year-end market, there may be some small and medium-sized board IPOs coming out for a test in January or the first quarter of next year. However, Xu Haiping, chief strategy analyst of Rixin Securities, said that the current market environment is not suitable for restarting IPO, and there is no hope of reopening IPO for at least 3 months. Xu Wei, a strategy researcher of Guojin Securities, also said that the earliest restart of IPO may be at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of next year, and the management will take more consideration of the market situation. Shanghai QDII's fundraising scale fell nearly 70% from the previous quarter. □ Reporter Qian Yu Evening News reported that the structural wealth management products and QDII business in the Shanghai market fell in the scale of fundraising, down 33.61% and 64.58% from the previous quarter respectively. In particular, small and medium-sized banks have the most significant decline in the amount of funds raised for the above two types of businesses. The Personal Wealth Management Business Analysis Report released by Shanghai Banking Supervision Bureau yesterday shows that as of the end of September 2008, the balance of personal wealth management products in Shanghai market was 134.226 billion yuan, up 25.47% from the end of the last quarter and 64.62% from the same period last year; A total of 135.62 billion yuan was raised, up 5.14% from the last quarter and 74.35% from the same period last year. In the third quarter, the market pattern of commercial banks' personal wealth management business in Shanghai was more significant, mainly focusing on RMB wealth management. In the third quarter, a total of 127.157 billion yuan of RMB wealth management products were raised, accounting for 91.7% of the total amount of wealth management products. Renminbi wealth management business focuses on trust wealth management and bond and money market instrument wealth management products. The total amount of funds raised by the two types of wealth management products was 60.466 billion yuan and 57.356 billion yuan respectively, accounting for 44.58% and 42.29% respectively.

意名记：罢工扇了百万球迷巴掌触到历史最可笑的一点《米兰体育报》安德雷阿·蒙蒂恭喜，给你们打分：3分。献给所有主席、球员和行政机构，你们秉承一贯风格，在一场超现实的比赛后给出了大家习以为常的结果：全是输家，没赢家。这个周末，在空荡荡的看台上，足球幽灵在徘徊游荡，或许庆祝着整个意大利这记漂亮的大乌龙。这次罢工、或封锁、或推迟——你们想怎么叫都可以——是扇在数百万足球爱好者脸上的巴掌。足球界的绅士们富豪们，请别做梦了，球迷软弱，但不是傻子，想挽回失去的民心、挽回你们已经失去还在下落的信用，想修复乌龙造成的损伤，那可不是一两天能实现的。你们搬石头砸自己脚，将来的苦果有你们好受。任何企图剖析问题实质在于集体合同这一条、那一条的人，省省力气吧，现实是我们触到历史最低点最可笑的一点，意大利足球体制的危机即政治、经济危机才是根本，看，没一个人能控制局面，没人能改变乌龙的轨迹，这说明涉事所有人罪过同等。人民将怨气发在球员身上，对，他们确是被惯坏的偶像，整天以摇滚明星自居，只要自己稍不如意被分在另一组训练，就觉得天大冤情，自述为失业者。是啊，他们是地球上最富有的下岗工人。但也得看到，多数球员是职业、敬业的，没有挑三拣四。尽管托马西无能，可还是在避免破裂。最终摇头的是老板们，我们足球的核心人物。他们很荒诞，空前的团结又空前的内部分歧。如果球员被宠坏，是他们宠的；如果一个球队有50个球员，那也是他们买的；财政赤字，他们搞的。如果说贝雷塔像个跳梁小丑，过错不是某条法律，而是老板们的权力太大，无边际不受制约。可球员支付额外税赋、和所有公民义务一样这么简单的事都搞不定，他们的权力似乎对上不对下了。德拉瓦莱的足球证监会建议，有人赞成有人反对，我觉得这条路对了。足球投资者需尽快找到一个专业人士或团队，享有独立权力和思考空间来制定新的足球规则，将其推广，与其他领域主体沟通。更重要的，是要制定出整体推广意甲产品、将价值最大化的全面市场方案，学习英超、西甲的团结和境外扩张模式。别再抱怨球星出逃，别再指责意甲观赏性战斗力下降，再不切正要害流于皮毛之说，我们真的要沦为欧洲乡村了。里诺·邦菲(电影《足球教练》主人公)说过：“没买成苏格拉底，我们就买亚里士多德。反正所有动作，都要遵从哲学逻辑。”	里诺·邦菲,亚里士多德,苏格拉底,托马西,贝雷塔,德拉瓦莱,安德雷阿·蒙蒂	负向	"Yi Mingji: The strike fanned a slap in the face of millions of fans and touched the most ridiculous point in history. Congratulations from Milan Sports Daily Andrea Monti. Score for you: 3. Dedicated to all presidents, players and administrative institutions, you follow the consistent style and give the usual results after a surreal game: all losers, no winners. This weekend, football ghosts were wandering around on the empty stands, perhaps celebrating this beautiful big own goal in the whole of Italy. This strike, or blockade, or delay - you can call it what you want - is a slap in the face of millions of football fans. Gentlemen and rich people in the football world, please don't dream. Fans are weak, but they are not fools. If you want to win back the lost people's hearts, credit that has lost and is declining, and repair the damage caused by the own goal, it is not something that can be achieved in one or two days. You move stones to hit your feet, and you will suffer the bitter fruit in the future. Anyone who attempts to analyze the essence of the problem in terms of collective contracts, this one or that one, save your strength. The reality is that we have touched the most ridiculous point of the lowest point in history. The crisis of the Italian football system, that is, the political and economic crisis, is fundamental. Look, no one can control the situation, no one can change the trajectory of the own goal, which shows that all the people involved are equally guilty. The people vent their anger on the players. Yes, they are spoiled idols. They are self proclaimed rock stars all day long. If they are divided into another group for training, they will feel a great injustice and describe themselves as unemployed. Yes, they are the richest laid-off workers on earth. But it should also be seen that most players are professional and dedicated, and they don't pick and choose. Although Tomasi is incompetent, he is still avoiding a breakdown. In the end, the bosses, the core of our football, shook their heads. They are very absurd, unprecedentedly united and unprecedentedly divided. If the player is spoiled, they are the one who spoiled him; If a team has 50 players, they also bought them; If there is a financial deficit, they will do it. If Beretta is like a clown, the fault is not a law, but the power of the boss is too great and unlimited. But the players can't even do such a simple thing as to pay extra taxes and obligations like all citizens, and their power seems to be against the public rather than the public. Delaval's Football Securities and Futures Commission suggested that someone should agree and someone should disagree. I think this way is right. Football investors need to find a professional or team as soon as possible to enjoy independent power and space to think to formulate new football rules, publicize them and communicate with the main bodies of other fields. More importantly, we need to formulate a comprehensive market strategy to promote Serie A products and maximize their value, and learn from the unity and overseas expansion model of the Premier League and La Liga. Stop complaining about the escape of stars, stop blaming Serie A for its decreased combat effectiveness, and we will really become the countryside of Europe if we do not cut to the key and flow to the skin. Rino Bonnefe (the main character of the movie ""Football Coach"") once said: ""We didn't buy Socrates, so we bought Aristotle. Anyway, all actions should follow the logic of philosophy."""

基金投资策略渐入窄门偏股基金连续数月雷同本报记者周宏如果把过去2个月中，基金发布的股票投资策略做个统计的话，结果可能是惊人的相似。以震荡市为主要判断，以消费、新能源等行业为投资主题，偏股基金的投资策略，连续数月雷同已是不争的事实。如同一个生命一样，基金的投资策略应该也有其发端、发展、成熟乃至逐步修正的过程。但在A股市场行情迅速演绎的这两个月，基金的投资策略却两个月未变。是什么造就了基金策略们的“尴尬”？结构性策略依旧不知道什么时候，“捕捉机构性机会”成为基金行业里对于下阶段投资策略的“唯一主题词”。以上周公布的一家合资基金的投资观点为例，“鉴于宏观政策的不确定性，预计大盘将继续维持震荡格局，中小盘题材股长期活跃后累积了丰厚的获利盘，有调整空间，但权重股下行空间不大。板块方面，我们看好具有较强抗风险能力、稳定增长的行业。”而早在几个月前，类似的推论已经在行业内铺天盖地。基金半年报中，包括广发、华安等大型基金管理公司旗下基金均众口一词的关注“新兴产业”、“大消费”的组合。而包括新能源、电动汽车、稀土等上游原材料组成的战略新兴产业，以及食品饮料、医药、农业、家电、零售等大消费产业，早在那时已经成为基金经理们口边的热门行业。及至目前，这种状况仍未有太多改变。宏观政策两难那么其中的原因又在哪里呢？不少基金经理认为，原由来自于目前的宏观经济环境。博时基金一位基金经理就认为，经济转型不会一蹴而就，特别是在当前经济增速下滑的情况下，增长速度让位于经济结构调整将是长期趋势，尤其未来几年中预计资源、劳动力等生产要素使用成本逐步提高，人民币渐进升值；在保证投资和出口稳定增长情况下，社会保障力度逐步提高，而这个过程中，消费服务和科技创新将会获得更多的政策支持。还有基金认为，CPI同比3.5%的数据再次引发了市场对于加息的猜测。但考虑到未来物价涨幅有望平稳回落、经济运行仍存在不确定性，利率不大可能大幅上调，年内仍以保持稳定为主。如果物价涨幅继续走高，也不排除央行小幅提高基准利率的可能，以改善负的实际利率状况，管理通胀预期。在这样辗转的宏观经济下，投资要理清头绪确实有不小的压力。行业配置“惯性思维”同样可能影响基金经理的还包括惯性的投资思维。而这种思维，往往成为各类行业极端性表现的代表。业内一位颇有影响力的投资总监，此前就表示，避险情绪正在主导整个机构群体，不断把非周期类股的估值推向极致。“这是个情绪化的看法，非周期类公司的风险就真的没有？周期类公司真的业绩一直不理想？”他反问道。而业内或许已经出现了另一种判断，上投摩根的基金经理王振州表示，从经济周期的角度看，今年四季度和明年一季度，GDP预计将会在8以上，实体经济的情况好于先前的预期，因此大盘向下的空间已经不大。另外，由于和整个经济状况的相关性较高，一直以来低PE的蓝筹股的机会也将显现。当然，目前，这个观点在业内仍是少数。	周宏,王振州	正向	"The investment strategy of the fund gradually enters the narrow gate. The partial equity fund is similar to the reporter Zhou Hong for several consecutive months. If the stock investment strategy released by the fund in the past two months is counted, the result may be surprisingly similar. Focusing on the volatile market as the main judgment and consumption, new energy and other industries as the investment theme, the investment strategy of the partial equity fund has been the same for several consecutive months, which is an undeniable fact. Like a life, the investment strategy of the fund should also have its beginning, development, maturity and gradual modification. However, in these two months when the A-share market is rapidly evolving, the investment strategy of the fund has not changed for two months. What has caused the ""embarrassment"" of fund strategists? Structural strategies still do not know when ""capturing institutional opportunities"" has become the ""only theme word"" of the fund industry for the next stage of investment strategy. Taking the investment view of a joint stock fund announced last week as an example, ""In view of the uncertainty of macro policy, it is expected that the market will continue to maintain a volatile pattern. The small and medium-sized board themed stocks have accumulated a substantial profit making plate after a long period of activity, and there is room for adjustment, but the weight loss space is small. In terms of sectors, we are optimistic about the industry with strong anti risk ability and stable growth."" As early as several months ago, similar inferences have been widespread in the industry. In the fund's semi annual report, including GF and Huaxin and other large fund management companies, the funds under its jurisdiction all focus on the combination of ""emerging industries"" and ""big consumption"". At that time, the strategic emerging industries composed of upstream raw materials such as new energy, electric vehicles and rare earth, as well as the large consumer industries such as food and beverage, medicine, agriculture, household appliances and retail, had already become the popular industries on the tip of fund managers' tongue. Up to now, this situation has not changed much. Macroeconomic policy dilemma Then what is the reason for this? Many fund managers believe that it comes from the current macroeconomic environment. A fund manager of Boshi Fund believes that economic transformation will not be achieved overnight, especially at present, when the economic growth rate is declining, the growth rate will give way to the economic structural adjustment in the long run. In particular, it is expected that the use cost of production factors such as resources and labor will gradually increase in the coming years, and the renminbi will gradually appreciate; Under the premise of ensuring the stable growth of investment and exports, the social security will gradually increase, and in this process, consumer services and scientific and technological innovation will receive more policy support. Another fund believes that the year-on-year data of 3.5% of CPI has once again triggered the market's speculation on interest rate hikes. However, considering that the future price increase is expected to decline steadily and the economic operation is still uncertain, the interest rate is unlikely to rise significantly, and it will still focus on maintaining stability within the year.

When a person with a digital single lens reflex camera walked on the street, most people must think he is a photographer or a photography enthusiast. If someone now has a digital single lens reflex camera, most people will think that he is a photography enthusiast or a photography lover, or he may be a photography beginner. As a photographic tool with high quality imaging quality, the single lens reflex camera has quickly moved from the noble photographic hall to the popularization, allowing more people to enjoy the fun of creating high quality images.

The single lens reflex camera system (including lenses and cameras) has become our sweet burden for long journey, especially for female friends who love photography, it is inevitable that they will not be able to handle dozens of kilograms of photographic equipment. Even some professional photographers are also interested in portable and high-definition DC.

古巴美国在哈瓦那举行新一轮移民问题谈判新华网哈瓦那2月19日电(记者刘彤)古巴和美国政府代表团19日在哈瓦那就移民问题举行闭门谈判。这是自2009年7月14日重开移民谈判以来，古美两国政府举行的第二轮移民谈判。古巴外交部副部长达戈韦托·罗德里格斯和美国国务院负责西半球事务的助理国务卿帮办克雷格·凯利分别率领两国代表团参加了谈判。古巴代表团在谈判结束后发表的新闻公报说，双方在谈判中评估了两国已达成的移民协定的执行情况，并讨论了古方在上一轮谈判时所提出的有关移民问题新草案的相关内容。公报说，古方在谈判中重申了古巴在移民问题上所持的立场，即确保两国之间实现合法、安全和有序的移民，并在打击非法人口贩卖方面实施有效合作。古方同时还表示愿在合适的时候继续与美国举行移民谈判。罗德里格斯在谈判中表示，古巴方面严格执行了与美国在1994年签署的移民协定，但美国仍在执行的所谓《古巴移民修正法》导致两国之间无法实现合法、安全和有序的移民。美国政府颁布的《古巴移民修正法》规定，凡是古巴人，只要踏上美国的领土，美国就给予居留权。这实际上是在怂恿古巴一些非法移民不顾性命危险偷渡到美国。1959年古巴革命胜利后，美国政府曾采取鼓励古巴人逃离祖国的政策，然而大量非法移民的进入也给美国社会造成巨大压力。1994年，美古两国政府签署协定，古方保证采取措施制止对美非法移民，美方则同意每年接收至少两万名古巴合法移民。根据古美移民协定，两国每年应举行至少一次移民谈判，以评估移民协定的执行情况。2003年，布什政府以古巴政府缺乏诚意为由，无限期推迟同古巴的移民谈判。奥巴马入主白宫后，两国政府重新恢复了移民谈判。	达戈韦托·罗德里格斯,刘彤,奥巴马,罗德里格斯,布什,克雷格·凯利,凯利	正向	Cuban Americans held a new round of immigration talks in Havana Xinhua News Agency, Havana, February 19 (Reporter Liu Tong) The Cuban and American government delegations held a closed-door talk in Havana on February 19 to discuss immigration issues. This is the second round of immigration talks held by the two governments of Cuba and the United States since the reopening of immigration negotiations on July 14, 2009. Dagouvetto Rodriguez, Deputy Minister of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Craig Kelly, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs of the US Department of State, led the delegations of the two countries to participate in the negotiations. The Cuban delegation's press release after the negotiation said that the two sides evaluated the implementation of the immigration agreement reached by the two countries and discussed the relevant contents of the new draft on immigration issues proposed by Cuba at the last round of negotiations. The communique said that the Cuban side reaffirmed its position on immigration issues in the negotiation, that is, to ensure legal, safe and orderly immigration between the two countries, and to implement effective cooperation in combating illegal human trafficking. The Cuban side also expressed its willingness to continue to hold immigration talks with the United States at the appropriate time. Rodriguez said in the negotiation that the Cuban side had strictly implemented the immigration agreement signed with the United States in 1994, but the so-called Cuban Immigration Amendment Act still in force by the United States led to the fact that the two countries could not achieve legal, safe and orderly immigration. The Cuban Immigration Amendment Act promulgated by the US government stipulates that any Cuban who sets foot on the territory of the United States will be granted the right of residence by the United States. This is actually encouraging some Cuban illegal immigrants to smuggle to the United States regardless of the danger of their lives. After the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the US government adopted a policy of encouraging Cubans to escape from their homeland, but the influx of a large number of illegal immigrants also caused great pressure to the American society. In 1994, the governments of the United States and Cuba signed an agreement, under which the Cuban side promised to take measures to stop illegal immigration to the United States, and the United States agreed to receive at least 20000 Cuban legal immigrants every year. According to the Cuba US immigration agreement, the two countries should hold at least one immigration negotiation every year to evaluate the implementation of the immigration agreement. In 2003, the Bush administration indefinitely postponed the immigration talks with Cuba on the ground that the Cuban government lacked sincerity. After Obama moved into the White House, the two governments resumed immigration talks.
基金借创新突围困局：股指期货增添新砝码一季度以来，14只具有创新特质的基金产品“驰援”A股市场，占新发基金数量的39%，甚至出现一日四只创新产品齐发的局面。“创新”几乎成为今年基金行业被谈论最多的话题，而股指期货和融资融券业务的正式推出，更进一步打开了基金产品创新的策略空间。纵观年内发行的各基金产品，“创新”的份量也越来越重，指数产品风格化、杠杆使用频繁化、QDII出海多元化、ETF及其联接基金大行其道。然而，在这些产品创新的背后，却体现出基金业试图突破产品同质化严重、销售靠天吃饭、行业利润率下降等困境的努力。⊙本报记者马全胜孙旭多路齐发创新迭出截至4月19日，今年以来共有36只新基金开始发行，其中，32只投向境内市场，4只为QDII，风格化指数产品、带杠杆的分级基金、ETF及其联接基金成为主流。此外，境内首只采用LOF模式的QDII基金——国投瑞银全球新兴市场精选股票基金也将于近期发行；海富通基金已在准备发行可同时投资于A股及H股市场的“两栖”QDII产品；华安基金和富时集团也已达成协议，授权开发针对富时100指数的跨境ETF产品……创新基金产品正以前所未有的态势迅速填补着我国各细分市场领域的空白。在各类创新产品中，首先，指数基金的风格化渐渐成为一大潮流。无论是日前结束募集的首只行业指数基金——国投瑞银沪深300金融地产指数基金，还是首只A股市场风格指数ETF及其联接基金——华宝兴业上证180价值ETF及其联接基金，或是首只跟踪创新基本面指数的泰达宏利中证财富大盘指数基金，都是在2009年指数基金爆发式发展的基础上开发出来的风格化指数产品。“一方面，由于指数基金作为被动性投资产品，标的指数具有较强的排他性，为了避免同质化竞争，基金公司必须积极创新，开发具有不同风格特征的指数产品；另一方面，随着去年指数基金的大扩容，新指数的开发也呈现加速发展和差异化设计的态势；因此，发行不同风格特征的指数基金具备了多方面条件。”长信中证央企100指数基金经理许万国一语中的。安信证券首席金融工程师付强判断，“风格、行业和主题指数产品将是2010年指数基金的发行主流，在传统指数基金与ETF的竞争性发展格局上，今年ETF将获得优势，这主要是因为联接基金打通了ETF的银行渠道。”对于代表着当前最具创新水准的分级基金，由于其自身所具有的杠杆特性、可满足不同投资者的细分需求、以及存在多重交易策略选择，颇受市场关注。国联安基金公司副总经理王峰表示，“与国内现有基金产品同质化现象完全不同，分级基金通过其特有的基金收益分配制度对基金风险收益进行重新划分，建立杠杆效应，填补了追求高收益或稳定收益投资需求的空白。”根据记者从多家公司了解到的信息，目前正在加紧筹备的分级基金，包括债券分级基金，就有5只之多。此外，对于QDII基金的再度出海，目前已有国泰纳斯达克100指数、工银瑞信全球精选、长盛环球景气行业大盘等三只新产品上市发行。国泰君安证券基金分析师吴天宇表示，被动化投资和跨境ETF的出现将是今年QDII产品的新特点。据悉，当前市场已有多只QDII指数产品正在准备中。其中，鹏华基金已被授权开发摩根斯丹利资本国际公司旗下6只指数的ETF产品，博时基金也已获得开发标普500跨境ETF的授权。创新突围多角度求解然而，就在创新产品逐渐走向“深水区”之际，摆在基金公司面前的却是行业利润率逐渐下降、新基金发行难度加大、基民“赎老买新”等一系列难题。根据安信证券近期研究报告，自我国开放式基金诞生以来，2009年开放式基金首次出现了现金流为负的纪录。2009年开放式基金的净赎回为3588亿元，分红为730亿元，各种运营费用为381亿元，考虑3470亿元的新基金发行，现金流出量达到了1230亿元。尽管去年新基金的发行在很大程度上平滑了基金净赎回带来的影响，但如果从份额角度看，我国基金行业依然处于被净赎回状态。市场分析人士认为，“产品单一”和“渠道单一”是造成目前基金业拓展市场份额困局的主要原因。“放眼目前的基金市场，尽管几百只基金名目繁多，但基本模式和品种都差不多，这同市场的需求是脱节的。市场细分不到位，市场潜力无法得到充分挖掘，大量雷同的‘概念’降低了市场对于基金的投资热情；同时，基金销售渠道不够多元化，高峰时银行渠道过分拥堵，无法对每只在发基金都‘竭尽所能’去营销，基金产品的销售也就无法实现‘公平’和‘充分’。”一位银行理财师表示。日前，在中国证券投资基金年会上，易方达基金副总裁刘晓艳表示，“今年基金销售特别难，其原因不是因为产品过多，而是因为产品同质性太强，真正提供给客户的创新产品不多。”招商银行零售银行部副总经理张东则认为，“市场是有需求的，如果能够开发出客户需要的产品，基金销售其实并不困难，如银华基金旗下的保本基金募集当天就卖掉了48亿，最后启动了比例配售。”国泰君安证券金融工程负责人蒋瑛琨分析，未来基金创新领域可能主要向三个方向发展：其一，随着融资融券和股指期货的推出，基金产品创新的策略空间已被充分打开，就股指期货与ETF的结合就有很多创新可做；其二，基金的交易方式上会有所创新，特别是未来如果基金引入股指期货进行流动性管理的话，换手率会进一步降低，相应的投资成本也会降低；其三，基金产品的结构也会逐渐合理，保本型和杠杆型基金的创新方式将不断深化。事实上，为了促进基金行业发展，监管层正在不遗余力地推动基金产品的创新。在基金分类审批中，监管层为创新产品开辟了绿色通道，使得今年创新产品获批的速度加快。上交所副总经理徐明此前表示，上交所已同意有关基金公司开发追踪海外指数的跨境ETF，技术系统、后台服务等各项准备工作已基本就绪。深交所相关负责人表示，深交所将着力从国际化、指数化、结构化三个方向推动基金在交易所平台的发展。基金市场的蛋糕有望通过创新这一“发酵剂”实现扩大。此外，从目前的创新基金品种来看，大多数产品属于交易所交易的场内基金。分析人士指出，场内基金的交易品种日趋多样化、交易费用的相对低廉、以及交易方式的快速便捷使得场内基金具有较大的吸引力；场内交易基金的创新也可以有效拓宽券商等多个基金销售渠道，缓解基金拥堵扎堆发行的现象，使得基金销售更加充分和到位。创新之路并不平坦股指期货增添新砝码目前看来，基金产品的创新之路似乎并不平坦。有基金研究员人士指出，基金投资人是基金产品的需求方，是牵引基金产品发展与创新的根本性力量；而在当前A股市场，投资人往往将长期需求短期化，随着市场热点变化而追求短期内表现较好的基金；因此，未来基金产品的创新需要投资者教育工作和新产品开发设计并重。银河证券基金分析师王群航指出，受去年五月份长盛同庆成功发行的影响，部分基金公司经过了将近一年时间的准备，终于发行了具有更多创新成分的分级基金。不过即使如此，由于从理论上无法解决上市之后加权收益率将会折价的困扰，这些被寄予了更多希望的新产品发行情况并不理想。更为糟糕的是，部分基金公司的市场营销人员对于此类产品的理解程度也许很有限，在营销推广方面或许会存在误导投资者的嫌疑。目前，股指期货成功推出，已将一些新的操作策略引入基金管理人的视野。蒋瑛琨博士向记者表示，“最近一段时间以来，基金公司就股指期货方面的咨询显著增加，公募基金对于套期保值的关注已在提升，而且关注的公司也越来越多；对于专户业务，基金公司的关注点主要表现在套利策略和交易系统方面，甚至有的公司还交流了要不要就股指期货设一些专门的交易员。”此外，记者从一家券商研究所获悉，包括易方达、大成、泰达宏利在内的其他基金公司也已在积极备战与股指期货对接的专户产品。大成基金金融工程部执行总监高贵鑫表示，在股指期货推出初期，将更偏向于推出有充分的把握、结构相对简单、策略简洁清晰的套保产品；在股指期货市场正常运转一段时间后，大成基金会采用实际的市场数据对大成基金的各项工作进行检验，在能够确保套利模型有效运转，系统效率、工作流程和人员素质确实能够匹配套利要求，同时流动性等市场环境也能够满足套利需求时，再推出这类产品。	张东,许万国,孙旭,蒋瑛琨,王群航,吴天宇,刘晓艳,徐明,马全胜,王峰,高贵鑫	正向	"The fund uses innovation to break through the dilemma: the stock index futures adds new weights. Since the first quarter, 14 fund products with innovative characteristics have ""rescued"" the A-share market, accounting for 39% of the newly issued funds, and even four innovative products were issued on the same day. ""Innovation"" has almost become the most discussed topic in the fund industry this year, and the formal launch of stock index futures and margin trading business has further opened up the strategic space for fund product innovation. Looking at the various fund products issued within the year, the weight of ""innovation"" is also increasing, such as index product styling, frequent use of leverage, diversified QDII going to sea, and ETF and its connected funds are very popular. However, behind these product innovations, there are efforts of the fund industry to break through the dilemma of serious homogenization of products, dependence on the weather for sales, and decline of industry profit margin. ⊙ Our reporter Ma Quansheng Sun Xu launched many innovations up to April 19. Since this year, a total of 36 new funds have begun to be issued, including 32 for the domestic market and 4 for QDII. The stylized index product, the leveraged graded fund, and the ETF and its connected fund have become the mainstream. In addition, the first QDII fund in China that adopts the LOF model - Guotou Ruibin Global Emerging Market Stock Fund - will also be issued in the near future; Haitong Fund is preparing to issue an amphibious QDII product that can be invested in both A-share and H-share markets; Huaan Fund and Fosun Group have also reached an agreement to authorize the development of cross-border ETF products targeting the FTSE100 Index... Innovative fund products are rapidly filling the blank areas of various细分market fields in China with an unprecedented momentum. Among various innovative products, first of all, the stylization of index funds has gradually become a major trend. Whether it is the first industry index fund - Guotou Ruibin CSRC 300 Financial Real Estate Index Fund, which ended fundraising recently, or the first A-share market style index ETF and its connected fund - Huabao Xingye SFC 180 Value ETF and its connected fund, or the first TEDA Hongli CSRC Wealth Index Fund, which tracks the innovative basic index, they are all stylized index products developed on the basis of the explosive development of index funds in 2009. ""On the one hand, as passive investment products, index funds have strong exclusivity of the target index. In order to avoid homogenization competition, fund companies must actively innovate and develop index products with different style characteristics; On the other hand, with the substantial expansion of index funds last year, the development of new indexes also presents a trend of accelerated development and differentiated design; Therefore, the issuance of index funds with different style characteristics has many conditions."" Xu Wanguo, the manager of CSIC 100 Index Fund, hit the nail on the head. Fu Qiang, chief financial engineer of Anxin Securities, judged that ""style, industry and theme index products will be the main theme of index fund issuance in 2010. On the competitive development pattern of traditional index funds and ETFs, ETFs will gain advantages this year, mainly because the connected funds have opened up the bank channel of ETFs."" For the grading fund, which represents the most innovative level at present, it is widely concerned because of its inherent leverage characteristics, which can meet the needs of different investors and the choice of multiple trading strategies. Wang Feng, vice president of Guolian An Fund Company, said, ""Completely different from the homogeneity of existing fund products in China, the grading fund re divides the fund risk return through its unique fund income distribution system to establish a leverage effect, filling the gap of pursuing high returns or stable return investment."" According to the information I learned from several companies, there are as many as five grading funds, including bond grading funds, are being prepared. In addition, for QDII funds to go to sea again, there are three new products listed and issued, including Guotai NASDAQ 100 Index, ICBC CS Global Select and CS Global Prosperous Industry. Wu Tianyu, a fund analyst of Guotai Junan Securities, said that the passivation of investment and the emergence of cross-border ETFs will be the new features of QDII products this year. It is reported that there are many QDII index products in the current market that are under preparation. Among them, Penghua Fund has been authorized to develop 6 ETF products under Morgan Stanley Capital International, and Boshi Fund has also obtained the authorization to develop S & P 500 cross-border ETF. However, just as innovative products gradually move towards the ""deep water area"", the fund companies are faced with a series of problems such as the gradual decline of industry profit margin, the increase of new fund issuance difficulties, and the ""redeemption of old and new funds"" of fund investors. According to the recent research report of Anxin Securities, since the birth of our open-end funds, open-end funds first appeared a negative cash flow record in 2009. In 2009, the net redemption of open-end funds was 358.8 billion yuan, dividends were 73 billion yuan, and various operating expenses were 38.1 billion yuan. Considering the new fund issuance of 347 billion yuan, the cash outflow reached 123 billion yuan. Although the issuance of new funds last year largely smoothed out the impact of net redemption of funds, if we look at it from the perspective of shares, the fund industry in China is still in a state of net redemption. Market analysts believe that ""single product"" and ""single channel"" are the main reasons for the dilemma of the current fund industry to expand its market share. ""Looking at the current fund market, although there are many funds with different names, the basic models and types are almost the same, which is disconnected from the market demand. Market segmentation is not in place, market potential cannot be fully tapped, and a large number of similar 'concepts' reduce the market's enthusiasm for investment in funds; At the same time, the fund sales channel is not diversified. At the peak, the bank channel is too crowded, and it is impossible to ""do our best"" to market each fund under development. The sales of fund products cannot be 'fair' or 'adequate'."" A bank financial engineer said. Recently, at the annual conference of China Securities Investment Fund, Liu Xiaoyan, vice president of Yifangda Fund, said, ""Fund sales are particularly difficult this year, not because there are too many products, but because the homogeneity of products is too strong, and there are not many innovative products really provided to customers."" Zhang Dong, vice president of the Retail Banking Department of China Merchants Bank, believes that ""there is a demand in the market. If the products needed by customers can be developed, the fund sales are actually not difficult. For example, the guaranteed fund under Yinhua Fund was sold 4.8 billion on the day of fund raising, and finally the proportion of distribution was started."" Jiang Yingkun, head of the Financial Engineering Department of Guotai Junan Securities, analyzed that the future fund innovation may mainly develop in three directions: First, with the launch of margin trading and stock index futures, the strategy space for fund product innovation has been fully opened, and there are many innovations that can be combined with stock index futures and ETF; Second, there will be some innovations in the trading mode of funds, especially if the fund introduces stock index futures for liquidity management in the future, the turnover rate will further decline, and the corresponding investment cost will also decline; Third, the structure of fund products will gradually become reasonable, and the innovation mode of hedged funds and leveraged funds will be continuously deepened. In fact, in order to promote the development of the fund industry, the regulatory authorities are sparing no effort to promote the innovation of fund products. In the classification and approval of funds, the regulatory authorities have opened a green channel for innovative products, which has accelerated the approval of innovative products this year. Xu Ming, vice president of Shanghai Stock Exchange, said earlier that the Shanghai Stock Exchange had agreed to the cross-border ETF developed by relevant fund companies to track overseas indexes, and various preparations such as technical systems and back-end services were basically ready. The relevant person in charge of Shenzhen Stock Exchange said that Shenzhen Stock Exchange would focus on promoting the development of funds on the exchange platform from three directions: internationalization, indexing and structuring. The cake of the fund market is expected to be expanded through innovation, this ""fermentation agent"". In addition, from the current innovative fund varieties, most products are exchange traded on-site funds. Analysts pointed out that the on-site fund trading varieties are increasingly diversified, the relative low cost of trading, and the rapid and convenient trading mode make the on-site funds very attractive; The innovation of on-site traded funds can also effectively broaden multiple fund sales channels such as securities companies, alleviate the phenomenon of fund congestion and bunching issuance, and make fund sales more complete and in place. The road of innovation is not smooth. At present, the road of fund product innovation seems not to be smooth. Some fund researchers pointed out that fund investors are the demanders of fund products and the fundamental force to promote the development and innovation of fund products; However, in the current A-share market, investors often short-term their long-term needs, and pursue funds with good short-term performance with the"
尾盘杀跌难改温和调整格局⊙世基投资王利敏○编辑杨晓坤昨日大盘再现尾盘杀跌的一幕，沪市短时间内一度逼近2600点，但经多方最后20分钟的拉抬，仅小跌17点收盘，而且从个股涨跌比422：441来看，屡屡靠尾盘杀跌显然很难改变大盘温和调整的基本格局。市场再现尾盘杀跌尽管隔夜美股等周边市场依然强势，但地产等权重板块的走弱使昨日沪深股市多数时间处于绿盘交易，尤其是地产、金融、钢铁、有色、煤炭等权重板块的整体回落，使得代表指数的白线在昨日盘中显得相当疲软。但耐人寻味的是，代表中小盘等非权重股的黄线却屡屡往上走高。与权重股集体走弱相反，一是主板市场的医药、商业、酒类、农业以及旅游、军工等非权重板块相当活跃，二是前段时间表现平平的中小板、创业板再度走强。虽然沪综指跌破了5日、10日均线，而中小扳指以及创业扳指则双双运行于5日线上方。耐人寻味的是，如果没有2点钟以后的地产板块以及期指的一路杀跌，沪市原本很可能收出红盘，空方这一手法显然和本周二的借助利空传言尾盘杀跌，有异曲同工之妙。所以，屡屡用尾盘杀跌做空，其实表明空方底气不足。理当调整的几大理由大盘在经历了前段时间的逼空后，调整自在情理之中，理由相当充足。首先是大盘持续逼空使得技术面严重超买，需要调整。其一是上升斜率太陡，不利于行情的延续，要调整斜率，就得有个盘整的过程。其二是众多技术指标严重钝化或乖离率过大，需要有一个修正。其次是例如地产等众多权重股由于本轮行情涨幅已经不小，本身有个调整蓄势的过程。从这个意义上说，昨日在这些权重板块回调时，众多非主流板块以及中小板、创业板的活跃正好能够填补市场热点的匮乏。再次是光大银行发行上市在即以及一系列新的宏观经济数据即将公布，市场也有等一等的意愿。等到光大银行以及相关数据这两只靴子平稳落地后，再度上攻显然更加有利。另外，本轮行情由于采取了逼空方式，相当多投资者(包括机构)处于被轧空的尴尬境地，大盘回调一下，有利于争取更多的做多力量。温和调整是大概率昨日再现尾盘杀跌，使得大盘在跌破5日均线后进一步跌破了10日均线，调整的态势更趋明朗，以至市场对调整的方式分歧加大。我们不妨逐个分析。第一种方式是温和调整，以横盘、小阴小阳的方式进行。若如此，则一种可能是去拉头肩底的右肩，横盘一段时间后再度走高；另一种可能是稍作盘整后，等待20日均线上移后马上再度上攻。第二种方式是回落整理，形成第二个低点后，再度向上运行，类似于去年9月初从2639点上攻到3068点后，在回落到2712点后，再度上攻，形成低点不断抬高、高点不断上移的走势。第三种走势是就此结束上攻行情，重新考验2319点低点，不排除再创新低。笔者以为，第三种可能至少目前还没有这种迹象，基本可以排除。前两种可能中，我们倾向于第一种。所以，不管是做头肩底还是稍稍盘整再度上攻，对于踏空本轮行情者或仓位过轻者，应该是积极把握逢低吸纳的良机。	王利敏,杨晓坤	正向	It is difficult to change the pattern of moderate adjustment ⊙ Worldbase Investment Wang Limin ○ Editor Yang Xiaokun Yesterday's market once again showed a scene of killing in the tail market, and the Shanghai market一度 approached 2600 points in a short time, but after 20 minutes of pulling up by many parties, it only fell 17 points at the close, and from the ratio of 422:441 for individual stock price rises and falls, it is obviously difficult to change the basic pattern of moderate adjustment in the market by relying on repeated tail killing. Although the surrounding markets such as the overnight U.S. stock market were still strong, the weakening of the weighted板块such as real estate made the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets mostly trading in the green market yesterday, especially the overall retreat of the weighted板块such as real estate, finance, steel, nonferrous metals and coal, which made the white line representing the index quite weak in yesterday's market. But what is interesting is that the yellow line representing small and medium-sized non weighted shares is often going up. Contrary to the collective weakness of weighted stocks, the first is that the non weighted sectors such as medicine, business, wine, agriculture, tourism, and military industry in the main board market are quite active, and the second is that the small and medium-sized board and the GEM, which performed poorly in the previous period, are becoming stronger again. Although the Shanghai Composite Index broke through the 5-day and 10-day moving average, the SME Board Index and the GEM Index both ran above the 5-day line. Interestingly, if there had been no real estate sector and the一路kill of the futures index after 2 o'clock, the Shanghai Stock Exchange would have been likely to close on a red disk. This approach is obviously similar to the tactic of killing the market at the end of the day by using bad rumors on Tuesday. Therefore, it is really shows that the empty side is not confident enough to repeatedly short the market by killing the market at the end of the day. The reason why the market should be adjusted

Beijing Examination News (Reporter An Jingjing) The college autonomous recruitment prospectus has been issued one after another, and candidates with strength are ready to apply for their ideal colleges. The person in charge of the admission office reminds the examinees that when they participate in the selection of autonomous recruitment and submit the winning materials, they only need to provide certificates at the provincial level or above in the high school stage. In previous years, some candidates photocopied and sent all kinds of certificates they won in various competitions since primary school to prove that they were really excellent. Mu Lin, director of the admissions office of Beijing Forestry University, said that such application materials are too complex, but it is not helpful for the admissions office teachers to see the student's special skills at a glance. The applicant's application materials should be moderate, and the materials that best reflect his/her specialties and main achievements in the high school stage can be attached. There is no need to provide awards in junior high school or primary school. At the same time, when submitting application materials, the essential materials clearly required in the admission prospectus should be prepared and bound in a unified way. The relevant person in charge of the admissions office of Beijing Jiaotong University introduced that the school required candidates to fill in the ""application basis"" when applying online. Candidates should summarize and list their achievements and specialties according to their own achievements. The application must be representative and provide persuasive supporting documents. If there is a winning that meets the priority conditions, it must be filled in the ""main application basis"", and at the same time, the examinee must fill in the specific time and award status. Since it takes some time to mail written materials, candidates should try not to apply online until just before the registration deadline, which will reduce the chance of entering the preliminary review."
李玮峰转会再陷僵局申花决策改变逼武汉叫停谈判新浪体育讯　尽管上海申花方面刚刚公开了愿意以28万人民币的身价，租借李玮峰到其他任何一个俱乐部，直至08赛季中超联赛结束。不过，李玮峰转会武汉一事的谈判，目前还是再次陷入了僵局。而这种僵局，缘起24小时之内，申花高层的一次决策改变。事实上，武汉方面最早给出申花的引进李玮峰的计划是一个：半年加一年的先租借后转会方案。对于这个方案，申花高层和武汉俱乐部高层的说法基本一致，据知情人士透露了这个方案的大致想法：“武汉先租借李玮峰半年，费用是28万，明年正式转会，转会费用在200万人民币左右的转会合同。”据了解，本来这个方案是申花负责此次谈判的某位董事与武汉方面交涉达成的口头协议，但是，此后不足24小时的时间里，申花还是抱歉的通知了武汉方面，最终还是否决了这个谈判内容。“他们否定了他们此前给我们开出的条件。我不理解上海申花俱乐部为何会拒绝这样一份优厚的转会合同。”从来没有与申花俱乐部进行过谈判工作的武汉俱乐部总经理徐志强的无奈，显然是他不了解申花在队员转会谈判中的高水平谈判技巧。之前，申花与西安方面就引进申花某中场大将的谈判，也是在24小时之内，推翻了之前双方敲定的价钱，而最终使得双方不得不宣布了谈判以失败结束。而申花与国安之间王珂的转会谈判，也是一波三折，僵局不断，最终也是在国安更换了谈判负责人等等妥协政策下才宣告成功。据悉，目前上海申花俱乐部坚持“只租不转”，不过申花方面也还是为武汉开出了明年转会谈判中的优待条件：“如果这次租借成功的话，申花愿意在租借合同中为武汉方面注名：武汉享有明年对于李玮峰的优先转会权。”只是对于转会费的问题，申花方面有消息透露：“明年武汉要引进李玮峰还是要从500万转会费开始谈，绝不可能是之前半年的价钱，这个也是正常的，毕竟明年是一年的转会费。”	李玮峰,徐志强,王珂	负向	"Li Weifeng's transfer was once again at an impasse, and Shanghai Shenhua made a decision to force Wuhan to suspend negotiations. Sina Sports News Just now, Shanghai Shenhua made it clear that it was willing to lend Li Weifeng to any other club for 280000 yuan until the end of the 08 season's Super League. However, the negotiation of Li Weifeng's transfer to Wuhan is still at an impasse at present. And this deadlock stems from a decision change of the Shenhua leadership within 24 hours. In fact, the earliest plan given by Wuhan to introduce Li Weifeng from Shanghai Shenhua was a program of leasing first and then transferring for half a year and one year. For this solution, the top management of Shenhua and the top management of Wuhan Club basically agree. According to the person concerned, the general idea of this solution is: ""Wuhan will lease Li Weifeng for half a year, and the cost is 280000. Next year, he will officially transfer, and the transfer fee is about 2 million yuan for the transfer contract."" It is understood that this program was a verbal agreement reached by a director of Shenhua who was responsible for this negotiation with Wuhan. However, less than 24 hours later, Shenhua still apologized to Wuhan and finally rejected the negotiation content. ""They denied the conditions they had previously offered to us. I don't understand why Shanghai Shenhua Club would refuse such a generous transfer contract."" Xu Zhiqiang, the general manager of Wuhan Club, who has never negotiated with Shenhua Club, obviously did not understand Shenhua's high-level negotiation skills in players' transfer negotiations. Previously, the negotiation between Shenhua and Xi'an on the introduction of a midfielder of Shenhua was also overturned within 24 hours, and finally had to announce that the negotiation ended in failure. The transfer negotiation between Shenhua and Guoan for Wang Ke was also full of twists and turns, and the deadlock continued. It was not until Guoan changed the negotiation leader and other compromise policies that it was declared a success. It is reported that at present, Shanghai Shenhua Club insists on ""leasing but not transferring"", but Shenhua also offers preferential conditions to Wuhan for next year's transfer negotiation: ""If this lease is successful, Shenhua is willing to name Wuhan in the lease contract: Wuhan has the right of priority to transfer Li Weifeng next year."" However, as for the transfer fee, Shenhua revealed that: ""Next year, Wuhan will still have to start talking about the transfer fee of 5 million yuan to introduce Li Weifeng. It is impossible to be the price of the previous half year. This is also normal, after all, next year is a year's transfer fee."""
香港男子捡240万港元3个月无人认领将归拾金者南都讯记者王雅楠发自香港一个香港的哥捡到乘客落在车厢内的提包，打开一看里面竟有240万巨款。的哥连忙把钱交到湾仔警署。不料，三个月后去，失主没有找到，240万巨款也没人来认领！按香港民事法律，若警方在合理时间内未能找到物主，便会将财物归拾获者所有，这单新闻成为香港各大论坛的讨论热点。警方：翻查闭路电视未找到失主昨日，南都记者向香港警方核实此事，据警方介绍，今年5月底，一名男子向警方报案，称驾驶的士时发现一个手提包，内有大量现金。警员接报后，得知涉及大笔财物，于是马上通报上司，并详细记录了的士司机拾获现金的情况。警方初步点算，发现包内现金高达240万港元，袋中还有一些澳门某赌场有关的单据。香港警方称，接获的士司机报警后，曾积极追寻物主身份，包括翻查闭路电视，甚至向澳门赌场查询，但对方回复“近期未有接获职员表示失款。而翻查计算机记录，依然没发现有人曾报案有遗失240万元。在的哥向警方送交提包时，警方按照有关程序，在点收金额之后，向的士司机发了一张财物收据。按照香港警方惯例，若在指定期限内无人认领财物，而拾获者有意认领，警方便会通知拾获者前往警署领取财物。的哥原本以为“冒失鬼”丢失巨款，肯定会报警追钱的。在报案三个月后，这名的士司机打电话去警署，确认有无人前来认领。不料，竟被告知此案“仍在调查中”。此事在港引起很大反响，不少人对这笔钱的来历充满好奇，的士司机梁先生不信240万港元没人认领，他怀疑这笔钱的来历有问题。的哥热议：拾物常有，不够胆私藏按香港法例规定，以不法手段获取即属于犯法。因此，市民捡到财物，多交给警方处理。乘客坐的士，遗漏东西在车上时有发生。昨日，南都记者随机采访了几位香港的士司机，他们认为拾到巨款就像“中彩票”，不过不够胆私藏。“开车六年来，我也经常捡到东西，每次都交给警署，事后得知都有被失主找回，心里很踏实。”司机梁先生坦言，拾金不昧的行为从自身做起，这样香港才能形成好的氛围。东西丢了，谁都不开心。而的士司机李先生则笑言，自己曾经捡到一部iPhone4，交给警方后一直没找到失主，后来给家里的小孩在用。他说：“家里人都很意外，不过先交给警方调查，用起来也会安心很多。”有法可依找不到失主就归拾遗者此案件引发的讨论聚焦在“三个月后无人认领，可把财物交给拾遗者”的香港相关法律规定。立法会法律界议员涂谨申表示，处理拾获财物安排属民事法律，若警方在合理时间内未能找到物主，便会将财物归拾获者所有，一般以三个月为限，但若涉及贵重财物，超过三个月也可接受。警方在《警察通例》中也对处理拾获财物的程序有所规范，规定任何人如将拾获财物交给警署，应获发一张财物收据，收据正副本也须注明拾获者是否打算于指定限期过后认领财物。如果表示有此打算，警方须通知拾获者前往警署领取，负责的警员及拾获者也须在报告上签署核实。此外，根据香港法例，凡在机场、港铁范围及公共巴士拾获物品，即使交到警方而最后无人认领，失物也不会归拾获者所有，而是将物品交予机管局、港铁及巴士公司处理。(综合香港媒体报道)	涂谨申,梁先生,王雅楠,李先生	正向	"A Hong Kong man picks up 2.4 million Hong Kong dollars. No one claims it for 3 months. It will be returned to the拾金者Nandu News reporter Wang Yanan sent from Hong Kong. A Hong Kong taxi driver picked up a bag left by a passenger in the car. When he opened it, he found a huge sum of 2.4 million yuan. The taxi driver quickly handed the money to the Wanchai Police Station. Unexpectedly, three months later, the loser was not found, and no one came to claim the huge sum of 2.4 million yuan! According to Hong Kong civil law, if the police can not find the owner within a reasonable time, the property will be returned to the finder, and this news has become a discussion hotspot in major Hong Kong forums. The police: I didn't find the loser when I checked the closed circuit television. Yesterday, the reporter of Nandu News verified this with the Hong Kong police. According to the police, at the end of May this year, a man reported to the police that he found a handbag with a lot of cash when driving a taxi. After receiving the report, the police learned that it involved a large amount of money, so they immediately reported it to their superiors and recorded the situation of the taxi driver's cash pickup in detail. The police initially counted and found that the cash in the bag was as high as HK $2.4 million, and there were some bills related to a casino in Macao in the bag. The Hong Kong police said that after receiving the alarm from the taxi driver, they had actively pursued the identity of the owner, including checking the closed circuit television, and even inquiring from the casino in Macao, but the other party replied that ""there was no staff who had lost money recently. While checking the computer records, there was still no one who had lost 2.4 million yuan. When the taxi driver handed over the bag to the police, the police, in accordance with the relevant procedures, issued a receipt for the money to the taxi driver after receiving the money. According to the practice of the Hong Kong police, if no one claims the property within the designated time limit and the finder intends to claim it, the police will notify the finder to go to the police station to collect the property. The taxi driver originally thought that the ""clumsy ghost"" lost a huge amount of money, and he must call the police to chase money. Three months after the police reported, the taxi driver called the police station to confirm that no one had come forward to claim it. Unexpectedly, he was told that the case was ""still under investigation"". This incident has caused a great response in Hong Kong. Many people are curious about the origin of the money. Mr. Liang, a taxi driver, does not believe that no one will claim the HK $2.4 million. He suspects that there is something wrong with the origin of the money. Taxi drivers热议: It is common to pick up things, but they do not have the courage to hide them. According to the Hong Kong Ordinance, it is illegal to obtain money by illegal means. Therefore, citizens who pick up valuables mostly give them to the police for handling. Passengers often leave things in the car when they take a taxi. Yesterday, the reporter of Nandu randomly interviewed several taxi drivers in Hong Kong. They thought that picking up a huge amount of money was like ""winning the lottery"", but they didn't have the courage to hide it privately. ""In the past six years of driving, I have often lost things, and I have always given them to the police station. Later, I learned that they were all found by the loser, and I feel very comfortable."" Mr. Liang, the driver, frankly said that the behavior of not keeping money found should start with himself, so that Hong Kong can form a good atmosphere. I'm not happy when I lost things. Li, a taxi driver, jokingly said that he once picked up an iPhone4 and gave it to the police, but he never found the loser, and later gave it to the children at home to use. He said: ""The family was very surprised, but they first gave it to the police for investigation, and they would be much more comfortable when using it."" There is no way to find the loser, so give it to the loser. The discussion triggered by this case focuses on the relevant legal provisions in Hong Kong that ""if no one claims the property after three months, the property can be handed over to the loser"". Tu Jinshen, a legal member of the Legislative Council, said that the arrangement for handling the property found was a civil law. If the police could not find the owner within a reasonable time, the property would be returned to the finder, usually within three months. However, if it involves valuable goods, more than three months is also acceptable. The police also specify the procedure for handling the property found in the Police General Regulations, stipulating that anyone who hands over the property found to the police station shall be issued with a property receipt, and the receipt and its duplicate shall also specify whether the finder intends to claim the property after the specified deadline. If you indicate that you have this intention, the police must notify the finder to go to the police station to collect the money, and the police officer in charge and the finder must also sign to verify on the report. In addition, according to the laws of Hong Kong, if items are found in the airport, Hong Kong Railway and public bus areas, even if they are handed over to the police and no one claims them in the end, the lost items will not be owned by the finder, but will be handed over to the Airport Authority, Hong Kong Railway and bus companies for handling.

This includes the two consecutive championships of the Scottish Super League in the 98-99 and 99-00 seasons on behalf of the Rangers; After transferring to Arsenal, he won the Premier League championship in the 01-02 season and then won the FA Cup championship for another two years; Then he transferred to Barcelona at the peak of his career, and won the two consecutive championships of La Liga in the 04-05 season and the 05-06 season. In 2006, he even stood at the top of Europe and won the Champions League championship on behalf of Barcelona. But Van Bronckhurst is also unfortunate. In the Dutch national team of ""King of the Unlined"", he has never tasted the world championship or the European championship. The South African World Cup this year will be Van Bronckhurst's last chance. Since he first wore the orange battle uniform of the national team in 1996, Van Bronckhurst has played 100 games for the Dutch national team in 15 years, contributing 5 goals. However, heroes always have their own way of life. After this World Cup, Van Bronckhorst will also officially withdraw from the national team: ""This departure is just the end of a chapter in my life, but I do not want to end the time in Feyenoord. When my career is coming to an end, I hope to bloom the last light in South Africa, and I will also do my best to cooperate with my teammates and coaches to try to bring the World Cup back to the Netherlands. That's a perfect ending!""(Chen Chi)"
掌握三大点雅思听力9分其实并不难5月22日一早，我便守在电脑前，注视着雅思查分网站，不断的刷屏，期待着能早些看到自己5月9号雅思考试的成绩。8时左右，网站上终于出现了“总分：7.5听力：9阅读：8.5写作：6口语：7”的信息。一颗悬着的心最终落地。这样的成绩，虽然与自己的预期目标有一定的差距，但也颇感欣慰。回首自己的雅思的备考的过程，一路走来的并不平坦。这里，主要想和大家分享一下自己有关雅思考试和英语学习的经验，希望对大家有所帮助，使大家少走弯路。从整体来说，雅思考试属于一种能力水平测试，其考察的是考生对英语使用能力，也就是一个完善的语言结构。语言的价值体现主要在其传达和交换信息的能力，表现在日常生活中不外乎是“听/说/读/写”四项基本功，所以要在雅思考试中取得理想的成绩，就必须全面提高听说读写的能力，四项基本能力不可偏废其一。而这又从另外一个侧面反映了雅思考试的科学性与严谨性的同时，保证了雅思考试的信度与效度。具体来说，雅思考试所考察的四项基本能力可以分为两个大类，一个是语言输入类，包括听力与阅读；另外一个就是语言输出类，包括口语和写作。两种不同的能力大类，决定了其准备过程会有一定的差别。语言输入类，也就是听力和阅读部分，其考试的本质就是要求考生对给出的信息进行再加工，用另外的一种表达而已，各种题型大都有技巧可循，而新航道的老师早已对这类的技巧进行了整理与归纳，使每一个考生都能轻松掌握，灵活应对考试。就听力而言，正如杜小鹏老师所言：“雅思考试的听力部分考查的是三个方面：题型、节奏和词汇。三项同时同步考察，可能哪一项都不像其他几门那么难，但要求速度快，节奏感要强”。掌握了这三点，雅思考试的听力问题便可迎刃而解。而听力老师优雅的气质也使全班人为之倾倒，使掌握知识的过程事半功倍。而至于阅读而言，阅读老师总结出了雅思阅读的四大要素：第一，词汇量；第二，对语法题型的理解；第三，要对考试题型的了解并有很好的解题技巧；第四，有广泛的阅读量。相信考生如果认真按照这四点进行充分的准备的话，一个优秀的雅思成绩便指日可待。另外要补充的是阅读老师的风趣幽默的课堂风格，不去感受一下，真的会遗憾的。语言输出类，也就是口语和写作部分，其本质便是要求考生应用自身储备的知识，解决多样化的问题。我国的考生大都对这两项考试“心怀敬畏”。其实老师们也早已为考生们准备了各种有效的应对措施。比如口语老师所教授的口语课程，充分考虑了雅思口语考试中可能遇到的各种情况，并一一加以分解评述，使口语考试的每一部分，每一个话题都能被考生充分理解，并完美的掌握。而她激情澎湃的演说，也极大的鼓舞了同学们的信心。至于写作课，写作老师将写作考试的全部题型一一分解，详细阐述，并根据语言学习的自然规律，应用“模写”的方法使学生们能够在短暂的时间里快速提高自己的英语写作水平。需要强调的一点是，雅思考试中，无论是语言输入类的能力考察和语言输出类的能力考察都是统一于考察英语能力这一个框架之内，都是相互联系，相互促进的，绝不能使之对立起来。最后，要与大家分享的便是一条校训：“IwillpersistuntilIsucceed”。正是这句新航道的校训，伴随着我走过了近100个准备雅思考试的日日夜夜。也祝愿各位仍在为雅思奋斗的同学们考试成功！更多信息请访问：新浪雅思频道雅思论坛雅思博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。	杜小鹏	正向	"Mastering the three major points of IELTS listening 9 is actually not difficult. On the morning of May 22, I waited in front of my computer, watching the IELTS scoring website, constantly refreshing the screen, hoping to see my IELTS scores on May 9 as soon as possible. At about 8 o'clock, the website finally showed the information of ""total score: 7.5 Listening: 9 Reading: 8.5 Writing: 6 Speaking: 7"". A suspended heart finally landed. Although this result is somewhat different from my expected goal, it is also very comforting. Looking back on the process of preparing for IELTS, it was not smooth all the way. Here, I mainly want to share with you my experience of IELTS and English learning, hoping to be helpful to you and save you from taking detours. As a whole, the IELTS examination is a kind of ability test, which examines the examinees' ability to use English, that is, a complete language structure. The value of language is mainly reflected in its ability to communicate and exchange information, which is nothing but the four basic skills of ""listening/speaking/reading/writing"" in daily life, so in order to achieve ideal results in the IELTS examination, we must improve the ability of listening, speaking, reading and writing comprehensively, and none of the four basic abilities can be neglected. This also reflects the scientific nature and rigor of the IELTS exam from another side, ensuring the reliability and validity of the IELTS exam. Specifically, the four basic abilities tested by the IELTS exam can be divided into two major categories: one is the language input type, including listening and reading; The other is the language output type, including oral and written. Two different types of abilities determine that there will be some differences in their preparation process. Language input, that is, listening and reading, is essentially a requirement for examinees to reprocess the given information, that is, another way of expression. There are skills to follow for all question types, and the teachers of the new channel have long sorted out and summarized these skills, so that every examinee can easily master them and flexibly respond to the examination. In terms of listening, as Mr. Du Xiaopeng said: ""The listening part of the IELTS exam examines three aspects: question type, rhythm and vocabulary. Three items are examined synchronously. None of them may be as difficult as the other subjects, but they require fast speed and strong sense of rhythm"". Mastering these three points, the listening problem of the IELTS exam can be solved easily. The elegant气质of the listening teacher also makes the whole class fall in love with him, making the process of mastering knowledge more effective. As for reading, the reading teacher summarizes four elements of IELTS reading: first, vocabulary; Second, understanding of grammar question types; Third, understand the examination question type and have good problem solving skills; Fourth, have a wide range of reading. I believe that if examinees carefully prepare fully according to these four points, an excellent IELTS score will be available in the near future. Another thing to add is the funny and humorous classroom style of the reading teacher. If you don't feel it, you will really regret it. Language output, that is, oral and written parts, essentially requires examinees to apply their own knowledge reserves to solve diversified problems. Most examinees in our country ""fear and awe"" these two exams. In fact, teachers have also prepared various effective countermeasures for examinees. For example, the oral course taught by the oral teacher fully considers various situations that may be encountered in the IELTS oral examination, and breaks down and comments on them one by one, so that every part and every topic of the oral examination can be fully understood and perfectly mastered by the examinees. Her passionate speech has also greatly inspired the confidence of students. As for the writing course, the writing teacher decomposes all the question types of the writing examination, explains them in detail, and applies the method of ""model writing"" according to the natural law of language learning, so that students can quickly improve their English writing level in a short time. It is worth stressing that in the IELTS examination, whether it is the ability test of language input or the ability test of language output, they are unified in the framework of examining English ability, which is interrelated and promotes each other, and must not be opposed. Finally, I would like to share with you a school motto: ""I will persist until I succeed"". It was this new channel's school motto that accompanied me through nearly 100 days and nights of preparing for the IELTS exam. I also wish all the students who are still struggling for IELTS success in the examination!

杨洁篪：中国帮助非洲修建2200公里铁路十一届全国人大四次会议于3月7日上午10时在人民大会堂三楼金色大厅举行记者会，外交部部长杨洁篪就外交政策和对外关系问题答记者问。[杨洁篪]我们国家的发展我想为我们同其他国家的合作创造了更大的空间。这些年，我们同非洲国家进行了很多的合作。例如帮助他们加强基础设施的建设，已经帮助他们修建了2200多公里的铁路，3400公里左右的公路，这就像人一样，血脉畅通。这些国家就增强了可持续发展的能力，我们会进一步加强同各国的互利合作，来拉紧我们之间的利益纽带。我们也在努力尝试同发达国家一起来帮助第三国，特别是发展中国家。当然，这种三边的合作或者是四边、五边的合作必须要首先得到驻在国的同意和支持。	杨洁篪	正向	Yang Jiechi: China helped Africa to build 2200 kilometers of railway. The press conference of the Fourth Session of the Eleventh National People's Congress was held at 10:00 am on March 7 in the Golden Hall on the third floor of the Great Hall of the People. Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi answered questions from journalists on foreign policy and foreign relations. [Yang Jiechi] I think our country's development has created greater space for our cooperation with other countries. In recent years, we have had a lot of cooperation with African countries. For example, helping them to strengthen infrastructure construction, we have helped them build more than 2200 kilometers of railways and about 3400 kilometers of roads, just like people, blood vessels are unblocked. These countries have enhanced their ability of sustainable development, and we will further strengthen our mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries to tighten our interest ties. We are also trying to help third countries, especially developing countries, together with developed countries. Of course, such triangular, quadrilateral or five party cooperation must first obtain the consent and support of the host country.

Recently, the American magazine Prevention listed 10 common body signals to help you predict your health. 1. Finger length. British scholars found that women with shorter index fingers than ring fingers have twice the incidence of knee arthritis as ordinary people. Men with this characteristic have low estrogen levels and are also prone to arthritis. Prevention: exercise the muscles of the knee. When sitting still, stretch your legs parallel to the ground 10 times, each time for 5-10 seconds. 2. Height. The research of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States found that women over 1.58 meters tall are unlikely to live to 100 years old. Prevention: live a regular life, give up smoking and limit alcohol, eat less meat. 3. Leg length. British scholars found that people with leg length between 0.5-0.7 meters have a higher content of enzymes in their blood that cause liver disease. Prevention: avoid exposure to chemicals, wear masks and gloves when working in polluted places; Strictly control the amount of alcohol consumption. 4. Sense of smell. If the elderly cannot clearly distinguish the smell of food such as bananas, cinnamon, and lemons, the chance of developing Parkinson's disease in 4 years will increase by 5 times. Prevention: supplement more fish food rich in Omega-3. 5. Arm length. Tufts University in the United States found that women with short arms were 1.5 times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than women with long arms. Prevention: cultivating hobbies such as painting can reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by 2.5 times. 6. Earlobe crease. People with wrinkles in the earlobe area are prone to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Both ears have creases, with a risk of 77% disease. Prevention: slim down, lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 7. Belly. The Journal of Neurology recently found that middle-aged people with big bellies are 3.6 times more likely to develop dementia at the age of 70. Prevention: eat more olive oil, nuts and black chocolate, which can eliminate visceral fat accumulation. 8. Breast size. The Canadian Medical Association published a 10-year study and found that young women wearing D cups are 1.5 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those wearing A cups. Prevention: increase exercise intensity. People who do six 30 second fast running exercises on a treadmill have a 25% higher ability to metabolize blood sugar. 9. Length of calf. French scholars found that women with calf length less than 0.33 meters are easy to have carotid plaque, which increases the risk of stroke. Prevention: drink more green tea. People who drink five cups of green tea a day have the lowest incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. 10. Blood type. The Harvard Medical School found that people with blood types A, B, and AB are 44% more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those with blood type O. Prevention: eat more low-fat dairy products or fish, and supplement vitamin D. People who consume 300 international units of vitamin D per day have a 44% lower incidence of pancreatic cancer. ▲ (Feng Guochuan)

Sina Technology News reported on the afternoon of November 4. In less than one day, Sina Technology's vote on the dispute between Tencent and 360 has received more than 1450000 votes. Nearly 80% of users believe that both companies ignore users' interests for their own sake. User data analysis shows that Guangdong Province is the single largest voting area. The sudden escalation of the dispute between Tencent and 360 yesterday afternoon quickly became the focus of netizens' attention. In less than one day, Sina Technology's vote on this matter has received more than 1.45 million votes. In one of the surveys, voters were asked how to view the dispute between Tencent and 360. In this survey, more than 79% of the participating users chose ""both companies are for their own interests and do not consider users' rights and interests"", and the number of votes for this option also exceeded one million. Another 13.5% of users did not make a clear statement. This morning, after 360 announced last night that it would close the QQ guard download and its official page, 360 popped up a window to recall the QQ guard software this morning, asking users to uninstall the product, and provided a link to uninstall the software directly in the pop-up window. In the survey designed by Sina Technology for this purpose, more than 60% of the voting users said they would not uninstall the QQ bodyguard. Through the user analysis of the survey, it can be seen that the number of people from Guangdong who participated in the two surveys is more than 12%, becoming the largest single voting source area. The number of netizens from Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shandong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Hubei, Fujian, Henan and other provinces and regions accounts for half of the entire vote. The collision between 360 and Tencent reached a climax last night. From Tencent's announcement that it will stop running QQ on computers with 360 software, to 360's offline deduction of QQ bodyguards and sending users an emergency letter for help, the intensive move that lasted for 5 hours has attracted the strong attention of the industry and has also become the most entertaining topic in which netizens have participated in recent years.

阿里扎巴蒂尔一点完败给船长冠军球队需要这种人新浪体育讯　北京时间1月13日消息，火箭队今日做客夏洛特，迎战有强队克星之称的山猫队。火箭队在上半场一直保持两位数的领先优势，但在第三节开始后被对手掌控局面，并最终以94比102被对手逆转。火箭队这一场的失利当然和船长斯蒂芬-杰克逊的出色表现有关，后者打出职业生涯的最佳表现，拿下43分8个篮板，创出个人职业生涯单场得分的新高。拥有巴蒂尔和阿里扎两个一等一的防守球员，火箭队却还让斯蒂芬-杰克逊一个人羞辱了整个火箭队，毫无疑问，这一场的失利，他们要负上最大的责任。阿里扎全场比赛16投7中，三分球6投2中，罚球6中3，拿下19分6个篮板以及4次助攻。巴蒂尔全场比赛9投3中，三分球7中2，拿下10分和3个篮板。两人的得分相加比斯蒂芬-杰克逊还差了14分，但真正的差距并不是这14分，而是气质上的差别。而这一场的失利也再度证明，这一支火箭队仍然缺乏一个真正的领头羊。斯蒂芬-杰克逊比较巴蒂尔和阿里扎，身上多了一种匪气，这是他和火箭队这两位小前锋最大的不同。从能力上说，斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许算不上联盟一流的小前锋，但是他够自信，够坚决，敢于做动作，极有魄力。在前三节，山猫队几乎都在靠他一个人在支撑。在手感不好的情况下，斯蒂芬-杰克逊会选择用突破来制造杀伤。请注意，他的突破和阿里扎的突破不同在于，当前方有对手干扰的时候，杰克逊会直挺挺的迎上去，来拼得罚球机会，全场比赛他11次走上罚球线，10次罚中。而阿里扎的动作则更多的是躲闪，这倒不是说阿里扎偏软，但是你不能不说，这的确是一种缺乏自信的表现。杰克逊的这种匪气，在两队的相持阶段成为了左右胜负的关键。在第四节的相持时刻，火箭队将进攻机会交给了阿里扎来单打，而在山猫队方面，执行进攻任务的则是杰克逊。从第四节还剩下10分钟开始，在之后的6次进攻中，斯蒂芬-杰克逊5次得分，唯一的一次失败还是被巴蒂尔制造了进攻犯规，但很快杰克逊就逼迫巴蒂尔犯规，走上罚球线找回了面子。相反，火箭队方面，阿里扎就完全没有斯蒂芬-杰克逊的风范。他在持球进攻中很犹豫，突破的时候极为勉强，想背身单打，但显然又有些不知所措。进攻中的连续失败也影响了阿里扎的防守表现，一次无谓的干扰球还送给了对手两分。短短的5分钟内，火箭队被山猫队打了一个13比2，从领先5分变成了落后6分，并再也没有追过来。阿里扎的短板，在这一段时间内被暴露无遗。他缺乏一个强硬的心，缺乏那种必胜的信念。火箭队总经理莫雷曾经表示，期望阿里扎能够完成一种飞跃，一种从角色球员到一线球星的飞跃，但现在来看，这不仅仅是他的技术没有准备好，他的心理也没有准备好。斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许从能力上不是一个顶级球星，但是他对于胜利的那种渴望，那种信念，那种决心，的确是具备了赢家的气质。为什么当年在勇士，他能够带领球队制造黑八奇迹淘汰小牛，这也是关键原因。现在的这支火箭队就缺少这种球员，阿里扎不是，巴蒂尔不是，布鲁克斯也不是，斯科拉略有这样的气质，但他的身体条件、打法风格限制了他的作用。洛瑞也具备一定这样的气质，但和斯科拉一样，身体条件和技术限制了他的影响力。火箭队有太多的好孩子，他们需要一个像阿泰斯特像斯蒂芬-杰克逊这样有匪气特质的球员来激发这支球队的活力。颇为遗憾的是，在转会山猫之前，斯蒂芬-杰克逊曾经示好火箭愿意加盟，但火箭队错过了这样的机会。一支冠军球队中，不会只有好孩子，火箭队现在就缺少这么样的一个人。(大脸猫)新浪体育讯　北京时间1月13日消息，火箭队今日做客夏洛特，迎战有强队克星之称的山猫队。火箭队在上半场一直保持两位数的领先优势，但在第三节开始后被对手掌控局面，并最终以94比102被对手逆转。火箭队这一场的失利当然和船长斯蒂芬-杰克逊的出色表现有关，后者打出职业生涯的最佳表现，拿下43分8个篮板，创出个人职业生涯单场得分的新高。拥有巴蒂尔和阿里扎两个一等一的防守球员，火箭队却还让斯蒂芬-杰克逊一个人羞辱了整个火箭队，毫无疑问，这一场的失利，他们要负上最大的责任。阿里扎全场比赛16投7中，三分球6投2中，罚球6中3，拿下19分6个篮板以及4次助攻。巴蒂尔全场比赛9投3中，三分球7中2，拿下10分和3个篮板。两人的得分相加比斯蒂芬-杰克逊还差了14分，但真正的差距并不是这14分，而是气质上的差别。而这一场的失利也再度证明，这一支火箭队仍然缺乏一个真正的领头羊。斯蒂芬-杰克逊比较巴蒂尔和阿里扎，身上多了一种匪气，这是他和火箭队这两位小前锋最大的不同。从能力上说，斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许算不上联盟一流的小前锋，但是他够自信，够坚决，敢于做动作，极有魄力。在前三节，山猫队几乎都在靠他一个人在支撑。在手感不好的情况下，斯蒂芬-杰克逊会选择用突破来制造杀伤。请注意，他的突破和阿里扎的突破不同在于，当前方有对手干扰的时候，杰克逊会直挺挺的迎上去，来拼得罚球机会，全场比赛他11次走上罚球线，10次罚中。而阿里扎的动作则更多的是躲闪，这倒不是说阿里扎偏软，但是你不能不说，这的确是一种缺乏自信的表现。杰克逊的这种匪气，在两队的相持阶段成为了左右胜负的关键。在第四节的相持时刻，火箭队将进攻机会交给了阿里扎来单打，而在山猫队方面，执行进攻任务的则是杰克逊。从第四节还剩下10分钟开始，在之后的6次进攻中，斯蒂芬-杰克逊5次得分，唯一的一次失败还是被巴蒂尔制造了进攻犯规，但很快杰克逊就逼迫巴蒂尔犯规，走上罚球线找回了面子。相反，火箭队方面，阿里扎就完全没有斯蒂芬-杰克逊的风范。他在持球进攻中很犹豫，突破的时候极为勉强，想背身单打，但显然又有些不知所措。进攻中的连续失败也影响了阿里扎的防守表现，一次无谓的干扰球还送给了对手两分。短短的5分钟内，火箭队被山猫队打了一个13比2，从领先5分变成了落后6分，并再也没有追过来。阿里扎的短板，在这一段时间内被暴露无遗。他缺乏一个强硬的心，缺乏那种必胜的信念。火箭队总经理莫雷曾经表示，期望阿里扎能够完成一种飞跃，一种从角色球员到一线球星的飞跃，但现在来看，这不仅仅是他的技术没有准备好，他的心理也没有准备好。斯蒂芬-杰克逊或许从能力上不是一个顶级球星，但是他对于胜利的那种渴望，那种信念，那种决心，的确是具备了赢家的气质。为什么当年在勇士，他能够带领球队制造黑八奇迹淘汰小牛，这也是关键原因。现在的这支火箭队就缺少这种球员，阿里扎不是，巴蒂尔不是，布鲁克斯也不是，斯科拉略有这样的气质，但他的身体条件、打法风格限制了他的作用。洛瑞也具备一定这样的气质，但和斯科拉一样，身体条件和技术限制了他的影响力。火箭队有太多的好孩子，他们需要一个像阿泰斯特像斯蒂芬-杰克逊这样有匪气特质的球员来激发这支球队的活力。颇为遗憾的是，在转会山猫之前，斯蒂芬-杰克逊曾经示好火箭愿意加盟，但火箭队错过了这样的机会。一支冠军球队中，不会只有好孩子，火箭队现在就缺少这么样的一个人。(大脸猫)	杰克逊,莫雷,大脸猫,船长,斯蒂芬-杰克逊,阿里扎,斯科拉,巴蒂尔,布鲁克斯,洛瑞,阿泰斯特	负向	Ariza Batir's total defeat to the captain's championship team needs this kind of person Sina Sports News On January 13, Beijing time, the Rockets visited Charlotte to face the Bobcats, which is known as the strong team's nemesis. The Rockets kept a double digit lead in the first half, but they were controlled by the opponent after the beginning of the third quarter, and eventually lost to the opponent by 94-102. The defeat of the Rockets in this game was of course related to the excellent performance of Captain Stephen Jackson. The latter made the best performance of his career, scoring 43 points and 8 rebounds, creating a new high of his career single game score. With Battier and Ariza, two top defenders, the Rockets let Stephen Jackson alone humiliate the entire team. Undoubtedly, they should bear the greatest responsibility for this defeat. Ariza made 7 shots out of 16 shots in the whole game, 2 shots out of 6 shots in the three-point shot, and 3 shots out of 6 free throws, scoring 19 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists. Battier made 3 shots out of 9 shots in the whole game, 2 shots out of 7 shots in the three-point shot, scoring 10 points and 3 rebounds. The sum of the scores of the two was 14 points lower than Stephen Jackson, but the real gap was not these 14 points, but the difference in气质. This defeat also once again proves that this rocket team still lacks a real leader. Stephen Jackson has more bandit spirit than Battier and Ariza, which is the biggest difference between him and the two small forwards of the Rockets. In terms of ability, Stephen Jackson may not be a top small forward in the league, but he is confident, determined and courageous, and he is very powerful. In the first three quarters, the Bobcats almost relied on him to support them. When his hand feeling is not good, Stephen Jackson will choose to break through to cause damage. Please note that his breakthrough is different from Ariza's breakthrough. When there is an opponent interference in front of him, Jackson will go straight to win the free throw opportunity. In the whole game, he walked to the free throw line 11 times and made 10 free throws. While Ariza's move was more evasive, it is not to say that Ariza is soft, but you have to say, this is indeed a lack of confidence. Jackson's bandit spirit became the key to victory or defeat at the stage of confrontation between the two teams. At the moment of confrontation in the fourth quarter, the Rockets gave Ariza the opportunity to play alone, while Jackson was the one who executed the task of attacking in the Bobcats. Beginning with 10 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Stephen Jackson scored five times in the next six attacks. The only failure was caused by Battier's offensive foul. But soon Jackson forced Battier to commit a foul and regained his face by going to the free throw line. On the contrary, Ariza of the Rockets has no style of Stephen Jackson at all. He was very hesitant when he held the ball to attack, and it was very勉强when he broke through. He wanted to play a single back game, but he was obviously at a loss. The continuous failure in the attack also affected Ariza's defense performance, and an unnecessary interference ball also gave the opponent two points. In just five minutes, the Rockets were beaten 13-2 by the Bobcats, from a 5-point lead to a 6-point loss, and never caught up again. Ariza's short board was completely exposed during this period. He lacks a hard heart and the belief to win. Morey, the general manager of the Rockets, once said that he expected Ariza to make a leap, a leap from a role player to a first-line star. But now, it is not only his technology that is not ready, but also his psychology. Stephen Jackson may not be a top star in terms of ability, but his desire for victory, belief and determination are indeed the qualities of a winner. This is also the key reason why he was able to lead the team to create the miracle of eliminating the Mavericks when he was a warrior. The current rocket team lacks this kind of player. Ariza is not, Battier is not, Brooks is not, and Scola has a slight temperament, but his physical condition and playing style restrict his role. Lowry also has a certain kind of temperament, but like Scola, his physical condition and technology limit his influence. The Rockets have too many good children. They need a player with a gangster character like Artest and Stephen Jackson to stimulate the vitality of the team. It is regrettable that Stephen Jackson was friendly to the Rockets and willing to join them before he transferred to the Bobcats, but the Rockets missed this opportunity. A champion team will not only have good children. The Rockets now lack such a person.

邢佳栋热播剧角色盘点有刚毅有颠覆(组图)新浪娱乐讯《士兵突击》热播后，“伍六一”的扮演者邢佳栋被观众所熟识。几年过去了，邢佳栋在数部热播剧中都有上佳的表现，他的代名词开始多了起来，“师座”、“处座”、“指挥长”、“向所”等等。告别2010年，让我们一起来回顾一下邢佳栋带给你的美好记忆。最刚毅——《士兵突击》伍六一《士兵突击》的热播，火了一个团队，“不抛弃不放弃”这六个字刻在了人们的心中，而那个叫“伍六一”的兵也刻在了我们心里。邢佳栋赋予伍六一刚毅的灵魂，伍六一赋予邢佳栋闪耀的光环。人活一世，很难不遇到什么难办的事情，总是抱怨，为什么是我，总是犹豫，我该如何。我想，伍六一心里也不那么踏实，他知道留在部队，做个司务长，每人每天四千大卡热量也能混一辈子，跟他的戎装他的梦在一起，不离不弃。可是，伍六一放下了，他说，他选择离开。伍六一从不抱怨，他对任何人任何事没有一句怨言，他走他自己的路。再艰难，再痛苦，再蹉跎，再不易，他是伍六一，他就能坚强地走下去。最真诚——《军歌嘹亮》高权《军歌嘹亮》里的高权，告诉我什么是忠诚，什么是坚定。我们年少轻狂的时候，会为了一点小事铸下大错，如果没有扑住高权的战友，高权恐怕已经越过边境线，只是为了一张前女友的照片。也许对他来说那不仅仅是一张照片，还有他逝去的年华和初恋。邢佳栋的眼神如孩子般清澈，你能透过角色看到他的真诚，他的用心。历练成长后的高权，少年英才，验证了虎父无犬子的古语，他站在高大山面前，无愧于司令的儿子，他牺牲在界碑前，无愧于是中国的军人。高权用他的生命告诉我们，任何事情都不能成为犯错的借口，有些事情，不能做就是不能做，死也不能做，这个道理，高权懂得了。我们在泪落下的一刻，也开始懂得了。最宽容——《雪琉璃》向菩明《雪琉璃》播出的时候，我随着观看该剧的众人吼了一声，邢佳栋好美貌啊。好吧，向菩明真的就是得用美貌来形容，年轻，帅气，俊朗，玉树临风，倜傥但不风流。邢佳栋在选择角色的时候，总能将其人物的光辉点放大，我们在向菩明身上学习他容人的气度，当然，向菩明的心细如尘和思维敏捷也是他的优点，但我更欣赏其宽容。李柯确实有些才华，但行事冲动，动辄就以下犯上，能容忍得了这样的干将，才是大家之风。宽容是很内在的一种气质，演不出来，得是发自内心的大气和从容，心里有，才能有所洋溢。最挣扎——《我的团长我的团》虞啸卿《我的团长我的团》中的虞啸卿，一个骨子里透着骄傲的人，宁折不弯，这话是高城对伍六一说的话，我看着虞啸卿，开始相信什么是前世今生。这样的虞啸卿，书香门第里慢火煨出来的才华横溢；这样的虞啸卿，战火纷飞中鲜血锻造的王者风范。宁可折，不可弯。宁可败，不可退。宁可死，不可悔。可，往往天意弄人，所有的一切要他一一去面对，如果能再任性一点，他就打过江去，如果能再懦弱一点，他就拼上这条命。选择放下，比选择拿起要难，这一点，我是在很久以后才明白。比起伍六一，我总觉得虞啸卿这样的角色更适合邢佳栋，他的光芒是一个小小的班副压不住的，一收再收，也只能说年轻，还未成气候。然而，三十几岁虞啸卿，需要怎样的风范、底蕴、胸怀、和刚毅，这些邢佳栋都赋予了虞啸卿，而只有骄傲，是虞啸卿赋予邢佳栋的。最完美——《雾里看花》郑岩《雾里看花》中的郑岩，可能是最贴近邢佳栋本人的角色，看起来内敛恬淡，内心却有那么一点小狂野，开切诺基的爷们，不会是个内心很柔软的人。然而，善良和正直是一样一样一样的，我不会觉得郑岩好得太过了，我相信生活中总会有这样的人，“你没有遇到，并不证明没有这样的人，这样的人我就见过。”这话，是邢佳栋自己说的。我觉得，郑岩是个会让人内心阳光的人，比不了那些励志型的人物，但是他总是告诉你，眼睛是黑的心是红的，不能看见了利益就眼睛是红的心是黑的。这话，对于在当今社会混日子的我们，极为重要，要知道什么是可为，什么是不可为，这样，我们得到的，往往不仅仅是心安。最颠覆——《烈火红岩》杜荫山邢佳栋演了太多好人，《烈火红岩》的开播后颠覆了左右观众对他的印象，那个笑容阴鸷，手段毒辣的国民党高官，竟然是邢佳栋演的。你再也看不到伍六一或者虞啸卿的影子，他也不再是邢佳栋，他就是还原到历史当中的一个魔化到疯狂的刽子手。杜荫山，政绩斐然，深受党国重用。他外国留学归来，饱读诗书，官运亨通前程似锦。邢佳栋说：“杜荫山是个军人，他有属于他自己的信仰，他首先不能认为自己是坏人，他得认为他做的所有事情都是对的。杜荫山最不喜欢的就是严刑逼供，他认为这是最没有技术含量的一种做法，如果能通过其他途径来解决问题，大可不必闹出人命。当然，共产党人意志的坚定往往超出杜荫山的想象，他都是在迫不得已的情况下才动刑的。”最给力——-《桥隆飙》桥隆飙也许每个男孩子在小的时候都会幻想自己有一天能够骑马打仗成为英雄，桥隆飙这个顶天立地有血有肉的大英雄，被邢佳栋演“活”了。桥隆飙的豪气盖天和忠肝义胆，让他成为了“最给力”的那个人，还有什么能比这样的英雄让你更过目不忘的。邢佳栋在拍《桥隆飙》的时候吃了很多苦，也受了些伤，但他从不提起这些事情，他的心思都在戏上都在人物上，别的那些事情似是与他无关。桥隆飙骑着白马叱咤风云，迷倒了太多太多人。有网友开玩笑说：“骑着白马的未必是白马王子，也有可能是唐僧。《桥隆飙》火了之后这句话得改改，骑着白马的未必是唐僧，也有可能是桥隆飙。”如果/文	高城,高权,虞啸卿,杜荫山,伍六一,郑岩,邢佳栋,桥隆飙,高大山,李柯,向菩明	正向	"Xing Jiadong's hot spot role list is tough and subversive (photo) Sina Entertainment News After the popular soldier突击, Xing Jiadong, who played ""Wu Liu"", was familiar to the audience. Years later, Xing Jiadong had excellent performances in several popular TV dramas, and his synonyms began to increase, such as ""teacher seat"", ""seat seat"", ""commander"", ""to"" and so on. Goodbye 2010, let's review the beautiful memories Xing Jiadong has brought to you. The most tough - Wu Liu in the Soldier突击 The popular Soldier突击 fired a team, ""never give up"" These six words were engraved in people's hearts, and the soldier named ""Wu Liu"" was also engraved in our hearts. Xing Jiadong gave Wu Liu a tough soul, and Wu Liu gave Xing Jiadong a shining halo. People live in the world, it is hard not to encounter anything that is difficult to do. They always complain, why am I, and always hesitate, what should I do. I think, Wu Liu was not so stable in his heart. He knew that he could mix up his life for the rest of his life with 4000 calories per day as a captain if he stayed in the army, together with his military uniform and his dream, and never leave or abandon him. However, Wu Liu put it down and said that he chose to leave. Wu Liu never complains. He has no complaints about anyone or anything, and he goes his own way. No matter how hard, painful, frustrated or difficult it is, he is Wu Liu, and he can go on strong. The most sincere - Gao Quan in the Military Song and Loud Gao Quan in the Military Song and Loud told me what loyalty and firmness are. When we were young and mad, we would make big mistakes for a little thing. If we didn't catch Gao Quan's comrade in arms, Gao Quan had probably crossed the border line, just for a photo of his ex girlfriend. Perhaps, for him, it is not just a photo, but also his lost youth and first love. Xing Jiadong's eyes are as clear as a child. You can see his sincerity and thoughtfulness through his role. After Gao Quan has grown up and experienced growth, he is a young genius, which confirms the old saying that a tiger father has no dog son. He stands in front of the tall mountain, lives up to the son of the commander, and sacrifices in front of the boundary monument. He is a Chinese soldier. Gao Quan used his life to tell us that nothing can be an excuse for making mistakes. Some things, can not be done, can not be done, can not be done. Gao Quan understands this truth. We also begin to understand it at the moment when our tears fall. The most tolerant - Xiang Puming in the Snow Jade Glass When the Snow Jade Glass was broadcast, I shouted with the crowd who were watching the play, and Xing Jiadong was so beautiful. Well, Xiang Puming really has to be described as beautiful, young, handsome, handsome, graceful but not debonair. When Xing Jiadong chooses roles, he can always amplify the brilliance of his characters. We learn from Xiang Puming to tolerate others, Of course, Xiang Puming's careful dust like mind and agile thinking are also his advantages, but I appreciate his tolerance. Li Ke is indeed talented, but he is impulsive. He can tolerate such a dry man at his own will. This is everyone's style. Tolerance is an inherent气质, which cannot be acted out. It must be generous and calm from the heart. If you have it in your heart, you can have it. The most struggling - Yu Xiaoqing in My团长 My Group Yu Xiaoqing in My团长 My Group is a proud person who would rather break than bend. This is what Gao Cheng said to Wu Liu. Looking at Yu Xiaoqing, I began to believe in the past and present lives. Such a Yu Xiaoqing is a talented and talented scholar who is slow to simmer; Such a Yu Xiaoqing is a king's style forged in the war of flying blood. Rather than bend, rather than lose, rather than die, rather than regret. However, often God will play with people, and he has to face everything. If he can be a little more willful, he will fight across the river. If he can be a little more cowardly, he will fight for his life. Choosing to put down is more difficult than choosing to pick up, which I understood very late. Compared with Wu Liu, I always think that Yu Xiaoqing is more suitable for Xing Jiadong. His light is a small deputy class that can not be suppressed. He can only say that he is young and not yet in the climate. However, Yu Xiaoqing in his thirties needs style, heritage, chest and firmness. Xing Jiadong has given all these to Yu Xiaoqing, and only pride is given by Yu Xiaoqing to Xing Jiadong. The most perfect - Zheng Yan in the Fog and Flowers Zheng Yan in the Fog and Flowers is the role that is most close to Xing Jiadong himself. He looks reserved and quiet, but he is a little wild in his heart. He is not a very soft person in his heart. However, kindness and integrity are the same. I will not think that Zheng Yan is too good. I believe that there will always be such people in life. ""If you do not meet them, it does not prove that there are no such people. I have seen such people."" This is what Xing Jiadong said. I think Zheng Yan is a person who will make people sunny. He can't compare with those inspirational characters, but he always tells you that your eyes are black and your heart is red. You can't see the benefits of your eyes are red and your heart is black. This is very important for us who are living in today's society. We need to know what can be done and what cannot be done. In this way, what we get is often more than just peace of mind. Most subversive - Du Yushan Xing Jiadong Xing Jiadong played too many good people. After the premiere of ""Liu Huo Hongyan"", it subverted the audience's impression of him. The smiling and cruel Nationalist official turned out to be Xing Jiadong. You can't see the shadow of Wu Liu or Yu Xiaoqing. He is no longer Xing Jiadong. He is a demonized executioner还原to madness in history. Du Yushan has made remarkable political achievements and is heavily used by the party and the country. He returned from foreign study, well read, and had a promising career. Xing Jiadong said: ""Du Yushan is a soldier. He has his own belief. First of all, he can not think that he is a bad person. He must think that everything he does is right. Du Yushan least likes torture and coercion. He thinks it is the least technical way. If he can solve problems through other ways, there is no need to make a living. Of course, the will of the Communists often exceeds Du Yushan's imagination, and he is forced to punish only when he has no choice."" The most powerful - Bridge Long Biao Bridge Long Biao Maybe every boy will imagine that one day he can fight and become a hero. Bridge Long Biao, a great hero with flesh and blood, has been played ""alive"" by Xing Jiadong. The domineering and loyal spirit of Bridge Long Biao made him the ""most powerful"" person. Nothing can make you forget more than such a hero. Xing Jiadong suffered a lot and was injured while shooting ""Bridge Long Biao"", but he never mentioned these things. His mind was on the play and the characters, and other things seemed irrelevant to him. Bridge Long Biao rides a white horse to咤咤, and fascinates too many people.

印度地震死亡人数升至58人新华网新德里9月20日电(记者吴强)据印度当地媒体20日报道，18日印度东北部锡金邦发生的地震至今已造成58人死亡、几百人受伤。据报道，印度军队和营救人员在过去12小时内在锡金一些边远地区又找到了一些遇难者的尸体，锡金至今共有41人死于地震。由于救援人员还没有进入震中及其周围受灾最严重的地区，因此最终的伤亡人数还会继续上升。此外，附近的西孟加拉邦和比哈尔邦也有17人死于此次地震。到20日上午，几千名印度军人仍然冒着泥石流随时发生的危险继续打通进入锡金各边远地区的公路。由于桥梁、公路在地震中受损严重，印度军队连日来出动“大力神”运输机向灾区空投救灾物资和药品，并出动直升机向灾区空投救援人员和医务人员。锡金当地政府已经建立了100多个临时居住点，安置房屋被损毁的当地居民。19日下午，印度军队重新开通了通往锡金首府甘托克的唯一国道。甘托克的供电也已恢复，但锡金大多数地区的电力供应还未恢复。当地政府要求居民和外来旅游者暂时不要离开甘托克。甘托克的学校也宣布停课3天，等待检查学校建筑是否安全。	吴强	负向	"The death toll from the earthquake in India rose to 58 Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 20 (Reporter Wu Qiang) According to the local media in India on the 20th, the earthquake in Sikkim, northeast India, on the 18th has so far caused 58 deaths and hundreds of injuries. It is reported that the Indian army and rescuers found some victims in some remote areas of Sikkim in the past 12 hours, and a total of 41 people in Sikkim have died from the earthquake. Since the rescuers have not yet entered the most seriously affected areas in the epicenter and its surroundings, the final number of casualties will continue to rise. In addition, 17 people in the nearby West Bengal and Bihar also died in this earthquake. By the morning of the 20th, thousands of Indian soldiers were still risking the danger of mudslides at any time to open up roads to all remote areas of Sikkim. Because bridges and roads were seriously damaged in the earthquake, the Indian army has launched ""Hercules"" transport aircraft for several days to drop disaster relief materials and medicines in the disaster area, and has launched helicopters to drop rescue workers and medical personnel in the disaster area. The local government of Sikkim has set up more than 100 temporary residence points to settle local residents whose houses have been damaged. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Indian army reopened the only national road leading to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. Power supply in Gangtok has also been restored, but power supply in most areas of Sikkim has not been restored. The local government has asked residents and foreign tourists not to leave Gangtok for the time being. Schools in Gangtok also announced a three-day suspension of classes to wait for the safety check of school buildings."

The French player Vacher Lagrave and the Indian chess player Sumia won the men's and women's group championships respectively. Zhang Xiaowen, a Chinese chess player, won the fourth place in the women's group. Yu Yangyi and Li Chao ranked seventh and 12th in the men's group respectively. ▲ In the men's group, Vacher overtook Yu Yangyi at the last moment. In the battle to conclude the seventh place, the two chess games that decided the men's champion were from No. 3 chess player Sergey Zhigalko of Belarus and No. 8 chess player Ivan Popov of Russia, as well as No. 1 chess player Vacher Lagrave of France and No. 2 chess player Andreyjin of Russia. After more than four hours of fierce competition, Sergey Zhigalke, who scored the most, made a tie with Popov first. While Vacher Lagrave, a half point behind, beat Andreyjin first. In this way, Vacher Lagrave equalized the score with Sergey Zhigalke at the last moment. After 13 rounds, they both scored 8 wins and 5 draws with a total score of 10.5. Vacher Lagrave was lucky to win the championship again because of his slightly higher score, and he also won the ticket for the next World Cup. Sergey Zhigalke fell short of success and became the runner-up. Vacher Lagrave is also the second French chess player who won the men's world youth championship after the famous French player Lothier. Polish chess player Olsewski and American chess player Lindelmann respectively defeated Margovilashvili of Georgia and Iturizaga of Venezuela in the closing battle, and they scored 9 points together with Russian chess player Ivan Popov. After comparing the small scores, Olsewski ranked fourth, Popov ranked fifth, and Lindelmann won the sixth place. Yu Yangyi, a 15 year old Chinese player who participated in the World Youth Championship for the first time, played 41 rounds with Gregoryan, an Armenian chess player, in the last round, and then shook hands to make a balanced pawn ending. In this way, Yu Yangyi had 7 wins, 3 draws and 3 losses in 13 rounds, with a score of 8.5. The three people of Russian chess player Andreyjin, Armenian Gregoryan and Georgian Margovilashvili also scored 8.5 points. After comparing small scores, Andreyjin won the sixth round.

After comparing the small score, Iturizaga and Roedstein won the 10th and 11th places respectively. Li Chao ranked 12th and Howard ranked 13th. Li Chao's performance score was 2607 points, basically equal to his own score. ▲ The situation of the women's group match was somewhat similar to that of the men's group. The two India Turkey wars were the key battles to decide the champion. In the end, the Indian chess player Su Muer took the lead in defeating Oz Turk of Turkey. Turkish chess player Yildiz then played a steady draw with Indian chess player Geely. In addition, the 16 year old Peruvian rookie Deis Cori, the third chess player, easily defeated Paulette, the fourth chess player of Romania, in the closing battle with his back hand. As a result, Su Muer and Deis Cori tied with the leading Yildiz at the last moment. The three people all scored 9.5 points with 8 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses. Su Muer scored slightly higher and won the championship, automatically winning the ticket for next year's Women's World Championships. Deis Cori won the second place, and Yildiz lost the third place. Su Muer also became the third Indian chess player who won the women's world youth championship after Koneru and Harika.

邵佳一返京回国足留洋球员困境折射中国足球尴尬本报记者郭剑12月23日，上海，2009足球热身赛，中国国家队以3∶2惊险逆转上海东亚。CFP供图今天下午，屯兵上海集训的国足在热身赛中以3∶2逆转中甲球队上海东亚。主教练高洪波在赛前向记者证实，效力于德乙科特布斯队的前国脚邵佳一，将于本周末重返国足参加备战。这意味着新一届国足集训队，终于有了海外球员的身影。邵佳一今天回到北京。对于自己再次入选国足，他向记者表示：“进入国家队是每一个职业球员的荣誉，我能够再次进入国家队感到非常激动”。自从去年3月在世界杯外围赛上踢飞了点球，邵佳一就再也没有出现在国足名单中，如今能被眼光颇高的主教练高洪波招入帐下，邵佳一凭借的完全是自己在德乙联赛中的出色表现。“在什么位置并不重要，我是新球员，要努力适应球队的技战术打法，加快和队友的磨合，争取早日进入状态”，邵佳一表现得很谦虚。德乙联赛上周进入了冬歇期。除了因伤休战的6场比赛，邵佳一在11场联赛中打进了6个球，这足以证明邵佳一以目前的状态，完全有资格在国家队中担任主力。实际上，国足教练组对于海外球员回国效力的渴望并非只是邵佳一一人——至少以个人能力衡量，效力于苏超球队凯尔特人的郑智和参加韩国联赛的李玮锋，都可以加强国足的实力，即便是刚刚结束在荷兰埃因霍温“留学”的周海滨，对于国足来说也会是极大的补充。只不过郑智还在凯尔特人预备队艰难打拼，李玮锋则因比赛中情绪控制问题难以入选。周海滨愿意积极面对现实，他作出了很大努力，但是没有留在埃因霍温。”周海滨中方经纪人罗曼说，“他圣诞节前就回国，下个赛季首选山东鲁能。”罗曼认为，即便是预备队的比赛，对周海滨也有很大帮助，只不过“竞争非常激烈”，所以周海滨选择了回国发展。“他并不认为没有留在埃因霍温就是彻底失败，毕竟他在这个赛季学到了很多东西，这对他的足球生涯很有帮助。”“我个人认为，以中国留洋球员的实力，完全能够在欧洲二流联赛中站稳脚跟，荣昊也是这样。”罗曼介绍说，荣昊能否在新赛季留洋，“目前还没有确定，因为中国足协的转会政策还没有正式出台，而荣昊所属的俱乐部又是武汉，情况比较特殊，不过，以他的能力可以适应欧洲的二流联赛。”在竞争激烈的欧洲足球赛场，中国国内顶尖水平的球员最好的结果也只是栖身于二流联赛，这也是众多经纪人在运作国脚留学时最为“头疼”的现实问题。“我感觉我们的球员很难在一级联赛中效力，这有多方面的原因。”罗曼说，“最大的原因是最近几年，国家队在国际大赛中的成绩不好，比赛质量也不高，所以国外俱乐部对于中国球员不会很感兴趣，中国球员还没有被人家普遍认可。”国家队的成绩历来是国际足球市场考察球员的一大硬性指标——中、日、韩三国中，中国球员留学海外的窘迫境地，一直和国家队的亚洲排名“挂钩”。原国安主帅李章洙在离开中国时说，中国球员往往自视过高，“很多球员甚至不相信同日本和韩国之间的差距有那么大”，“我希望中国球员能在日本和韩国的联赛中锻炼锻炼。现在不少韩国球员参加日本联赛，这里面也有出于国家队层面的考虑。不过，日本和韩国国家队的核心球员，都是在欧洲一流联赛中效力的。”以刚刚结束的两轮欧洲顶级联赛为例，韩国当红新锐李青龙为英超博尔顿队进球，前锋朴周永则为法甲摩纳哥队进球，在德甲踢球的车杜里为弗莱堡打满全场，该队最终输给多特蒙德也在情理之中，反倒是效力于曼联的“前辈”朴智星有些沉寂。韩国海外兵团的耀眼表现并没能完全抢走日本海外兵团的风头，虽然转投西甲西班牙人的中村俊辅仍得不到主教练的信任，但效力于法甲格勒诺布尔的松井大辅、效力于德甲波鸿的小野伸二和效力于意甲卡塔尼亚的森本贵幸均为首发球员，而卡塔尼亚击败尤文图斯也是本轮意甲的最大冷门。在日韩本月相继公布的国家集训队名单中，日本有6人在海外效力，韩国队海外兵团的成员更是多达7人，和明年10月就要参加世界杯亚洲区第一轮资格赛的国足相比，直接进入第三轮20强赛的日、韩，已经占有明显优势。“我个人并不看好国足能打进巴西世界杯，这和教练没关系，主要是球员的实力达不到。”一名足球经纪人告诉记者，“前几年，中国球员以为在国外联赛能挣很多钱，所以都愿意出国去见见世面，结果出去后发现自己水平不行，对环境也不适应，几乎没有上场机会。这两年，想出去的球员都比较实际了，不过，要想在国外顶级联赛占有一席之地，目前的这批球员都不够格。”本报北京12月23日电	车杜里,小野伸二,邵佳一,罗曼,郑智,中村俊辅,荣昊,李章洙,周海滨,郭剑,李玮锋,森本贵幸,朴周永,高洪波,朴智星,松井大辅,李青龙	正向	"On December 23, Shao Jiayi returned to Beijing, the capital of China, to reflect the embarrassing situation of Chinese football. Guo Jian, a reporter from China. On December 23, 2009, Shanghai, the national football team of China made a thrilling comeback to Shanghai East Asia with a score of 3:2 in the football warm-up match. CFP provided a picture. This afternoon, the national football team stationed in Shanghai for training made a comeback of 3:2 in the warm-up match against China East Asia, the team of China's top league. Before the game, head coach Gao Hongbo confirmed to the reporter that Shao Jiayi, the former national football player who played for Cotbus, a German team, would return to the national football team this weekend to prepare for the game. This means that the new national football training team has finally got the figure of overseas players. Shao Jiayi returned to Beijing today. Speaking to reporters about his selection for the national team again, he said: ""It is the honor of every professional player to enter the national team, and I am very excited to be able to enter the national team again"". Since he flew a penalty in the World Cup qualifying round last March, Shao Jiayi has never appeared on the national team list. Now he can be invited by the highly regarded head coach Gao Hongbo, which is entirely based on his excellent performance in the German B team. ""It doesn't matter where I am. I am a new player. I should strive to adapt to the team's technical and tactical style, speed up the integration with my teammates, and strive to get into shape as soon as possible"", Shao Jiayi was very modest. The German B team entered the winter break last week. In addition to the six games in which he was out of action due to injury, Shao Jiayi scored six goals in 11 league games, which was enough to prove that Shao Jiayi was fully qualified to play in the national team as a main player at present. In fact, the national team's coaching staff's desire for overseas players to return to China is not unique to Shao Jiayi - at least in terms of personal ability, Zheng Zhi, who plays for Celtic, a Scottish super team, and Li Weifeng, who plays in the South Korean league, can strengthen the national team's strength. Even Zhou Haiyan, who has just ended his studies in the Netherlands, will be a great addition to the national team. However, Zheng Zhi is still struggling hard in the Celtic reserve team, and Li Weifeng is hard to choose because of his emotional control in the game. Zhou Haiyan is willing to face the reality positively, and he has made a lot of efforts, but he did not stay in Eindhoven."" Zhou Haibin's Chinese agent Roman said, ""He returned home before Christmas, and Shandong Luneng was the first choice for the next season."" Roman believes that even the preparatory team's game is very helpful to Zhou Haibin, but ""the competition is very fierce"", so Zhou Haibin chooses to develop at home. ""He does not think that it is a complete failure not to stay in Eindhoven, because he has learned a lot this season, which is very helpful to his football career."" ""In my opinion, Chinese overseas players have the ability to stabilize their footing in the second-rate league in Europe, and Rong Hao is also like this."" Roman said, Rong Hao is able to stay abroad in the new season, ""At present, it has not been determined, because the transfer policy of the Chinese Football Association has not yet been officially issued, and the club where Rong Hao belongs is Wuhan, which is very special. However, his ability can adapt to the second-rate league in Europe."" In the fiercely competitive European football arena, the best result for China's top domestic players is to live in the second-rate league, which is also the most ""painful"" realistic problem for many agents to operate national team members to study abroad. ""I think our players find it hard to play in the first league, and there are many reasons for this."" Roman said, ""The biggest reason is that in recent years, the national team has not performed well in international competitions, and the quality of the game is not high, so foreign clubs are not interested in Chinese players, and Chinese players have not been widely recognized."" The national team's performance has always been a major hard indicator for the international football market to examine players - the embarrassing situation of Chinese players studying abroad in China, Japan and South Korea has always been ""linked"" with the Asian ranking of the national team. Li Zhangzhu, the former head coach of Guoan, said when he left China that Chinese players often overestimate themselves. ""Many players do not even believe that the gap between Japan and South Korea is so great"". ""I hope that Chinese players can exercise in the leagues of Japan and South Korea. Now, many South Korean players participate in the Japanese league, which is also considered at the national team level. However, the core players of the national teams of Japan and South Korea are playing in the top European leagues."" Taking the two rounds of top European leagues that have just ended as an example, Li Qinglong, a popular new player in South Korea, scored for Bolton, an English Premier League team, and Park Chou Yong, a forward, scored for Monaco, a French League team. Che Du-ri, who plays in the German Bundesliga, played the whole game for Freiburg, and it is reasonable that the team eventually lost to Dortmund. On the contrary, Park Ji Sung, the ""senior"" who played for Manchester United, was somewhat silent. The eye-catching performance of the South Korean overseas army did not completely take away the spotlight of the Japanese overseas army. Although Zhongcun Junfu, who switched to Spanish La Liga, still could not win the trust of the head coach, Song Jiafu, who played for Grenoble in France, Xiao Yanshen, who played for Bochum in Germany, and Morimoto Guixing, who played for Catania in Italy, were all starting players. Catania's defeat of Juventus was also the biggest upset of this round of Serie A. In the national training team lists of Japan and South Korea respectively announced this month, there were six people in Japan and seven members of the South Korean overseas troops. Compared with the national football team, which will participate in the first round of the Asian World Cup in October next year, the direct entry of Japan and South Korea into the 20 strong in the third round has an obvious advantage. ""Personally, I don't think the national football team can make it to the World Cup in Brazil. It has nothing to do with the coach. The main reason is that the players are not strong enough."" A football agent told reporters, ""In recent years, Chinese players thought they could make a lot of money in foreign leagues, so they were willing to go abroad to see the world. As a result, they found that they were not good enough and did not adapt to the environment, so they almost had no chance to play. In recent two years, the players who want to go out are more practical. However, if you want to occupy a place in the top foreign leagues, the current batch of players are not qualified.""

iPhone版Skype最早下周发布新浪科技讯北京时间3月27日上午消息，据国外媒体报道，可靠消息称，针对苹果iPhone(手机上网)手机而开发的Skype软件最早将于下周发布。该消息称，Skype很可能在4月1日召开的无线通信展(CTIAWireless)上发布iPhone版Skype。当前，iPhone用户只能通过第三方服务访问Skype。此前，Skype已经推出了针对WindowsMobile智能手机的Skype应用。因此，推出iPhone版Skype应用早在人们预料之中。对于iPhone用户而言，这无疑是个好消息。但短期内，Skype应用还不可能取代标准的iPhone语音呼叫。在通话质量上，VoIP的表现还不是特别令人满意。此外，根据iPhone用户的通话习惯，使用Skype也不会在很大程度上降低通话费。但在国际长途上，使用Skype确实可节省不少费用。有消息称，苹果第三代iPhone将支持视频捕捉功能。如果属实，当2011年AT&T将网络升级到4G后，Skype还可以将iPhone变成一部便携视频会议设备。(李明)相关报道：Skype将推iPhone版免费通话软件苹果第三代iPhone可能6月8日发布	李明	正向	Sina Technology News reported on the morning of March 27, Beijing time. According to foreign media reports, reliable sources said that the Skype software developed for Apple's iPhone (mobile Internet) mobile phone would be released as early as next week. The report said that Skype is likely to release the iPhone version of Skype at the wireless communication exhibition (CTIAWireless) on April 1. At present, iPhone users can only access Skype through third party services. Previously, Skype had launched Skype applications for WindowsMobile smart phones. Therefore, it is no surprise that the iPhone version of Skype application was launched. For iPhone users, this is undoubtedly good news. However, Skype application is unlikely to replace the standard iPhone voice call in the short term. In terms of call quality, VoIP is not particularly satisfactory. In addition, according to the calling habits of iPhone users, using Skype will not reduce the call cost to a large extent. However, using Skype can save a lot of money on international long distance calls. It is reported that Apple's third generation iPhone will support video capture function. If true, after AT&T upgrades its network to 4G in 2011, Skype can also turn the iPhone into a portable video conferencing device. (Li Ming) Relevant report: Skype will launch the free call software of the iPhone version of Apple's third generation iPhone, which may be released on June 8

房地产：环首都经济圈规划带来地产机会海通证券涂力磊事件：近日，河北省邀请包括北京市规划委在内的官员、专家学者，就“环首都经济圈”规划编制方案征集意见。会上，北京市规划委副主任王飞表示，北京“不会独自建设首善之区”，而会通过区域整体发展的方式，来解决面临的问题。河北省委常委、常务副省长赵勇表示，将借鉴东京、首尔等首都经济圈的经验，制订总体规划、专项规划、控制性详规等，预计将在明年1月底前完成。点评：1.“虹吸”效应带来城市问题。作为中国首都的北京，一直以来在招商引资、政策扶持、金融支持等方面都享有明显的优惠。这种待遇上的不平等直接造成北京的发展程度远超出周边、甚至是国内所有城市。这一现象的直接结果就是所谓的“虹吸”效应，即首都周边地区的人才、资金、资源都不同程度向北京集中。大量人口、资源的集中使得北京在快速发展后出现众多城市病，如人口膨胀、交通拥挤、资源紧张、房价高涨、发展空间受限、改善生态环境压力加大等突出问题。在北京可开发面积日益减小的今天，这些城市病显得更加明显。2.从“虹吸”效应到“溢出”效应。“环首都经济圈”就是在这样的背景下所产生。其主要目的在于在政策和规划上给与北京周边地区一定扶持，使得相关区域可以进一步承接北京的“溢出效应”。在北京高速发展之后，将相关过多的产业、人口、资金向周边地区覆盖。3.“环首都经济圈”介绍。“环首都经济圈”建设的总体思路，是在邻近北京将近1000公里的范围内，主要包括环绕北京的张家口、承德、廊坊、保定四个地级市，建设一个发展特区；包括建设高层次人才创业园区、科技成果孵化园区、新兴产业示范园区、现代物流园区，以新兴产业为主导的经济圈。这个发展特区将包括京东、京南、京北三个新城以及7个人口在30万人以上的中等规模城市，将环绕北京的区域建成一个全封闭的城市带。4.投资建议。目前许多国家首都经济圈创造的生产总值占国家的三分之一以上。而京津冀三省市，2009年GDP合计为36600亿，占全国的比重仅为10.9%，距离达到全国1/3还差75180多亿。虽然因为我国国土面积较大，城市聚集不可能达到日本、韩国的程度。但是，相关产业承接、人口迁移针必然给经济圈内城市带来经济发展和地价重估。在经济圈内享有土地储备的房地产公司无疑将直接受益。我们认为“首都经济圈”相对其他区域振兴概念而言具备更大的现实意义，可以直接解决目前首都所面临的众多问题。因此概念后在后期有望持续升温。概念相关受益个股包括：荣盛发展、亿城股份、万通地产、空港股份。5.风险提示。目前不排除国家出台进一步的紧缩政策，将会对地产行业的运行产生相对负面的影响。	王飞,涂力磊,赵勇	正向	"Real estate: Huan Capital Economic Circle Planning brings real estate opportunities Haitong Securities Tu Leilei Event: Recently, Hebei Province invited officials, experts and scholars, including the Beijing Planning Committee, to solicit opinions on the Huan Capital Economic Circle Planning. At the meeting, Wang Fei, deputy director of the Beijing Planning Committee, said that Beijing ""will not build a capital alone"", but will solve the problems in a way of overall regional development. Zhao Yong, member of the Standing Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Deputy Governor in charge, said that we should draw on the experience of capital economic circles such as Tokyo and Seoul to formulate the general plan, special plan, and control detailed planning, which is expected to be completed by the end of January next year. Comments: 1. ""Siphon"" effect brings urban problems. As the capital of China, Beijing has always enjoyed obvious preferential treatment in terms of investment promotion, policy support, financial support, etc.. This unequal treatment directly causes Beijing's development far beyond the surrounding areas, or even all cities in China. The direct result of this phenomenon is the so-called ""siphon effect"", that is, talents, funds and resources in the surrounding areas of the capital have been concentrated in Beijing to varying degrees. The concentration of a large number of people and resources has caused many urban diseases in Beijing after rapid development, such as population expansion, traffic congestion, resource tension, high housing prices, limited development space, and increasing pressure on improving the ecological environment. In today's Beijing, where the area available for development is decreasing day by day, these urban diseases are more obvious. 2. From the ""siphon effect"" to the ""spillover effect"". The ""Huan Capital Economic Circle"" is generated in this context. The main purpose is to give certain support to the surrounding areas of Beijing in terms of policies and planning, so that the relevant areas can further承接the ""spillover effect"" of Beijing. After the rapid development of Beijing, the relevant industries, population and funds will be covered in the surrounding areas. 3. Introduction of ""Huan Capital Economic Circle"". The general idea of ""Huan Capital Economic Circle"" construction is to build a special development zone in the range of nearly 1000 kilometers near Beijing, mainly including four prefecture level cities around Beijing, such as Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Langfang and Baoding, and to build an economic circle dominated by emerging industries, including high-level talents' entrepreneurship parks, science and technology achievements incubation parks, emerging industries demonstration parks, and modern logistics parks. This special development zone will include three new cities of Jingdong, Jinnan and Jingbei, and seven medium-sized cities with a population of more than 300000 people, and the surrounding area of Beijing will be built into an fully enclosed urban belt. 4. Investment suggestion. At present, the gross product value created by the capital economic circle of many countries accounts for more than a third of the country. The total GDP of the three provinces and cities in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei in 2009 was 3660 billion, accounting for only 10.9% of the country, 751.8 billion short of a third of the country. Although China's land area is large, urban agglomeration can not reach the level of Japan and South Korea. However, the industrial承接and population migration in the relevant areas must bring economic development and land price revaluation to the cities in the economic circle. Real estate companies with land reserves in the economic circle will undoubtedly benefit directly. We believe that the ""Capital Economic Circle"" has greater practical significance than the concept of revitalization of other areas, and can directly solve many problems faced by the capital at present. Therefore, the concept is expected to continue to heat up in the later period. The concept includes beneficial shares such as Rongsheng Development, Yicheng Shares, Wantong Real Estate, and Airport Shares. 5. Risk warning. At present, it is not ruled out that the state will introduce further tightening policies, which will have a relatively negative impact on the operation of the real estate industry."

Wang Feng's music style, which is full of tension and vitality, made the fans on the spot boil, and he released his passion with Wang Feng. Wang Feng also revealed that a new album will be released in November, and the concert after December will be new songs. The concert was the first concert after Wang Feng signed a new contract with his new employer and successfully established his status as the ""Rock Brother"" in China. The concert was full and the atmosphere was warm. The song ""Crying Fist"" is so powerful that the audience under the stage has been accumulating for a long time. In 120 minutes, Wang Feng's penetrating voice was sometimes thick and bleak, sometimes exciting and shocking, completely conquering the audience. Wang Feng also passionately interpreted such classic works as the best-selling ""Spring"" and ""Bloom of Life"", which once again made the fans feel Wang Feng's music style, which is full of tension and life! When the concert came to the climax, the audience stood up with Wang Feng to rock and roll. At the scene, Wang Feng also personally went on stage with three new Chevrolet Capucheo owners to compete for songs. Together, they sang a song ""Flying Higher"" as the end of the concert, and the atmosphere at the scene exploded to the highest point. Beijing station considered inviting Xu Wei's new album to cover a wider range. In addition to Shenzhen Station, Wang Feng's ""Burst"" trip with Capuche will also go to several cities in China, including the December Beijing Wukesong Gymnasium concert, which has been confirmed. For this event in Beijing, Wang Feng is doing a lot, and now he is starting to prepare some details. When asked whether to invite Xu Wei as a concert guest, Wang Feng said: ""I never invited him to my concert before, and these good friends can come to see him. If I think I want to find a guest, the old Xu, my good friend, will definitely come to participate."" When asked about the repertoire of each station, Wang Feng introduced that the new album will be listed in November, and the concert after December will be new repertoire. Wang Feng has a lot of music works with distinct themes, and this is no exception. In addition to the songs with anti war style, the themes and fields involved will be more. Advice to rock newcomers: have enough tolerance and endurance. As the ""rock brother"", Wang Feng's music is also considered the most mainstream in rock and the most rock in mainstream music. Wang Feng said that he did not think he was very successful now in response to this praise: ""The biggest experience of being able to achieve success now is that you have enough tolerance and patience to endure the suspicion, doubt and scolding of many misunderstandings, and you need to have a mature mentality and firm ideas to bear these. When success comes, it will never feel like a success. I think it's like this."" Wang Feng's success has also inspired many young people to join the ranks of domestic rock. When asked whether to develop newcomers? Wang Feng said that doing rock and roll in China has provided them with a lot of space. But it's hard for me to find an excellent rock musician. I hope all the people who do music are diligent, hardworking and down-to-earth. Lake water/Text"
陆天明专访：我迷上了微博不会催着陆川结婚8月21日至24日，本报举办“群英汇”名家笔会，著名作家陆天明应邀出席。从与韩寒之间的激烈对话，到动车事故后成为话题人物，陆天明都在专访中做出回应。采访中，记者还提到了导演陆川(微博)与女星秦岚(微博)的恋情，身为陆川的父亲，陆天明坦言，他很着急当爷爷。迷上微博有不会的地方就问网友陆天明抵连当日，记者在其入住的酒店对其进行了一次专访。在酒店房间的写字桌上，陆天明的电脑上显示的是微博网页。“你是微博控？”听到记者这样问，陆天明呵呵地笑了起来，“我应该算是吧。不过，我已经在控制了，我没换手机就是让自己别这么迷微博。我有不少朋友，飞机一落地，立刻打开手机看微博，就连吃饭的时候也要看，而我已经很控制了。”刚玩微博的时候，陆天明有许多功能都不会用，“有不会的地方我就问网友，有很多人来教我，现在我会加关注、发私信，还会发长微博，都是网友们教我的。”因为开通了博客，2009年，陆天明与韩寒在博客上展开了激烈辩论，那段时间里，陆天明俨然成了话题人物。在采访中，他主动向记者提及当年的那次吵架经历。“我当年在博客上与韩寒吵架，网上骂声一片。当时网站的人劝我要不把博客关闭了吧，但我没关。如果没有当年的那次吵架，我真不知道网络上还有那样的年轻人，他们有那样的思想、价值观。”时隔几年，陆天明说，当年第一次在网络上看到那些激烈的评论时，他气得浑身都在打颤，“后来我理解了，每个人都有本来的我，不同场合戴着不同面具，在网络上，大家都躲在电脑背后，就可以完全暴露自己了。”如今，陆天明已能很坦然地面对网络上的各种评论，“因为不同的人对事情会有不同的看法。”身陷舆论已能坦然面对言语攻击开了博客之后，因为与韩寒吵架的事情，陆天明在博客上成为话题人物。开通微博后，前段时间，动车发生事故，陆天明因为一条微博，又一次成为话题人物。对于这次成为话题人物，陆天明很愤怒也很无奈，“我的那条微博上传于动车出事之前，我觉得是有些人故意那样转发我的微博，而且，我在动车出事之后再发的微博，那些人好像根本不看，一味混淆视听，用我之前发的微博说事儿。”事后，有朋友劝陆天明删了那条微博，他坚决拒绝，“我问心无愧，绝对不删除。”采访中，陆天明说因为创作的缘故，他曾经采访过研究高铁的工程师，“作为我们国家自主研发的技术，我知道那些工程师们有多么不容易。出事之后，我刚好在上海，本来要坐飞机回北京的，我退了飞机票，专门买了高铁票，这不是作秀，因为我真的认为这项技术是我们民族的骄傲。”与上一次看到网上各类人说出各种伤人的话不同，这一次面对网络上的攻击，陆天明坦然许多，“我明白微博上有各种各样的人，应该理性对待，所以这一次无论看到大家写出什么偏激的话，我都能接受了。”文学创作应该放下架子走近大众陆天明曾在安徽农村当过农民、小学教师，在新疆生产建设兵团当过农工、农场武装连代理指导员、场机关干部，现任中央电视台电视剧制作中心文学部专职编剧，《大雪无痕》、《省委书记》、《命运》都是他的代表作。谈到文学，陆天明说，如今纯文学的环境已经不如当年，“但曾经不少作家对纯文学的追求，也有一些过火。不少追求纯文学的人，不太看重读者的反应，只表现自我，甚至有的人还以此为荣。”对于这样的做法，陆天明说自己也曾经有过，“比如，我写的小说《泥日》，当年二十多位评委看完之后，都说不知道我在说什么。当时写的就是不告诉你主题，就让人看不懂。”但随着社会的发展，陆天明认为搞纯文学是不行的，“我用了十年的时间来转型，之所以能写出那么好看的故事，我是经历了很痛苦的转型期的。文学不应该高高在上，而应该更接地气，必须要让读者喜欢阅读，跟着故事一起哭一起笑，纯文学不能像从前那样看不起大众，而应该放下架子，让老同志和老百姓都满意。”儿子婚事换种方式催促陆川结婚陆天明早年成名，那个时候，他常听人说：“这是陆川，陆天明的儿子。”而如今，随着儿子陆川名气越来越大，很多人都会说：“这是陆天明，陆川的爸爸。”对于这样的转换，陆天明其实很高兴，“哪有父母不希望自己的孩子有出息的，我儿子能有这样大的出息，我真是睡觉的时候都要笑醒。”父亲是编剧，儿子是导演，两个人有太多的可能合作出一部作品，对于这样的说法，陆天明说他们也有此意，“很早之前就有人问我和陆川能不能一起做一部电影出来，我们有这个意向，但至少现在还没有成型。这样一部作品，一定得是我和陆川都满意的，要找到我们两代人之间最好的契合点，要一加一能大于二，不然随便做出一部作品，很容易被人认为有捞一票的嫌疑。”今年结婚的明星格外多，采访中，记者问及陆川与女友秦岚是不是也好事将近。对于儿子的终身大事，陆天明像所有剩男剩女的家长一样着急，但他却笑着说他不会催，“我不催他结婚，但会变相地问他，我什么时候能抱上孙子或孙女，用这个办法催他。”记者方海征事件回放陆川秦岚因拍“南京”相恋2009年9月，有圈内人士爆料，称《南京！南京！》导演陆川与戏中主演秦岚因戏结缘，正在热恋。2008年10月，就有网友爆料看到二人约会拥吻，由此可见这段恋情持续已久。记者联络上当时正在法国准备转机参加圣塞巴斯蒂安国际电影节的陆川，他大方回应并承认恋情。据悉，秦岚不仅以“零片酬”出演《南京！南京！》，还因为档期问题支付了另一个剧组数十万的赔偿金，为拍摄付出了巨大心血，她的出色演出打动了影片导演陆川，“友情”渐渐升华为“爱情”。尽管相恋已久，但二人一直十分低调。据《重庆晚报》报道相关阅读秦岚演“吕后”被批又老又胖这是服从陆川的命令秦岚在男友陆川导演的新片《王的盛宴》里饰演“吕后”，早前亮相时惹来不少杂音，从批评她的皮肤松弛，到胖得太夸张，再到“孕相十足”。前日，秦岚接受了记者采访，大方回应争议，她坦言，这一切都是为了陆川，她“服从命令”地变胖变老。记者：大家都说你变胖了。秦岚：为了演吕后这个角色，导演希望我增肥嘛。我以前的体重差不多是95斤到96斤，现在应该是108斤左右。记者：陆川一直嫌你太瘦？秦岚：以前陆川就觉得我的形象比较纤细，吕后在电影中出现时，年纪已经比较大了，如果太单薄的话，这个人物的气场就不够。他希望我能够胖一点，因为胖能显出成熟感，在这个基础上再去做一些老态的造型，出来的效果会比较好。记者：会不会抱怨导演让自己做这么大的牺牲？秦岚：我难受啊，我以前能穿的衣服，现在死活都穿不上了，拍完这部戏我马上就去强制减肥。记者：陆川导演在表演上给你很大压力吗？秦岚：拍了这么多年戏，“吕后”是我最难完成的角色。有段时间我的压力很大，精神极度紧张，尽管我心里特别想吃东西，但经常吃不下，可为了变胖，还是得吃。记者：很多人看你发胖，都问你是不是怀孕了？秦岚：因为他们不知道我为什么会发胖。他们说太胖了，应该是怀孕了，其实我还挺开心的，因为我一直担心自己不能在这么短的时间里变胖，没想到我做到了。据《新快报》报道	陆天明,陆川,秦岚,方海征,韩寒	正向	"Lu Tianming's exclusive interview: I am fascinated by microblog, and I will not urge Lu Chuan to get married from August 21 to 24.

As Lu Chuan's father, Lu Tianming frankly said that he was in a hurry to be a grandfather. Lu Tianming, who was addicted to microblog, asked netizens when he arrived in Lian. On the day, the reporter conducted a special interview with him at the hotel where he stayed. On the desk of the hotel room, Lu Tianming's computer showed the microblog web page. ""Are you a microblog control?"" When the reporter asked this question, Lu Tianming laughed, ""I should be. However, I have been in control. I didn't change my mobile phone to make me so fascinated by microblog. I have a lot of friends. As soon as the plane landed, they immediately opened their mobile phones to see microblogs, and even when they had dinner, they also wanted to see them. I have been very controlled."" When he first played microblog, Lu Tianming had many functions that he could not use. ""If there is anything I can't do, I will ask netizens. Many people came to teach me. Now I will add attention, send private messages, and send long microblogs, which are all taught by netizens."" Because of the opening of the blog, in 2009, Lu Tianming had an intense debate with Han Han on the blog, and at that time, Lu Tianming became a topic figure. In the interview, he proactively mentioned to the reporter the experience of quarreling that year. ""When I quarreled with Han Han on my blog that year, the Internet was full of curses. At that time, the people of the website advised me to close my blog, but I didn't. If it were not for the quarrel that year, I would not know that there are still young people on the Internet, and they have such thoughts and values."" Years later, Lu Tianming said that when he first saw those fierce comments on the Internet, he was so angry that his whole body was trembling, ""Later, I understood that everyone has his original self, wearing different masks on different occasions, and everyone can completely expose himself behind the computer on the Internet."" Now, Lu Tianming can face all kinds of comments on the Internet very calmly, ""Because different people have different views on things."" Being trapped in public opinion can calmly face verbal attacks. After opening a blog, Lu Tianming became a topic figure on his blog because of his quarrel with Han Han. After opening a microblog, a bullet train accident occurred in the early stage, and Lu Tianming became a topic figure again because of a microblog. With regard to this, Lu Tianming was very angry and helpless. ""My microblog was uploaded before the bullet train accident. I think some people deliberately forwarded my microblog in that way. Moreover, the microblog I sent after the bullet train accident seemed to be ignored by those people, and they were deliberately confusing the public with the microblog I sent before."" Later, some friends advised Lu Tianming to delete the microblog, and he firmly refused, ""I have a clear conscience, and I will never delete it."" In the interview, Lu Tianming said that because of the reason of creation, he once interviewed the engineers who studied high-speed rail, ""As our country's self-developed technology, I know how hard those engineers are. After the accident, I was just in Shanghai. I was going to fly back to Beijing. I withdrew my plane ticket and bought a high-speed rail ticket on purpose. This is not a show, because I really think this technology is the pride of our nation."" Unlike the last time I saw all kinds of people on the Internet say all kinds of hurtful words, this time Lu Tianming is very calm in the face of attacks on the Internet, ""I understand that there are all kinds of people on microblog, and they should be treated rationally, so this time, no matter what radical words everyone writes, I can accept them."" Literature creation should put down the shelf and get close to the public. Lu Tianming once worked as a farmer, primary school teacher in Anhui countryside, agronomist, farm armed regiment agent instructor, and field organ cadre in Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. He is now a full-time screenwriter of the Literature Department of CCTV TV Drama Production Center. The Heavy Snow without Trace, Provincial Party Secretary and Destiny are his representative works. Speaking of literature, Lu Tianming said that the environment of pure literature is not as good as before, ""But many writers once pursued pure literature, which was also too radical. Many people who pursue pure literature do not pay much attention to the reaction of readers, but only show themselves, and even take pride in it."" Lu Tianming said he also had this practice, ""For example, the novel Mud Day I wrote. After more than 20 judges finished reading it, they all said they didn't know what I was talking about. At that time, what I wrote was not to tell you the theme, but to make people understand."" But with the development of society, Lu Tianming believes that pure literature is not enough, ""I spent ten years to transform. The reason why I can write such a beautiful story is that I have experienced a painful transition period. Literature should not be high above, but should be more down-to-earth, and must let readers like reading, cry and laugh with the story. Pure literature should not look down on the public as before, but should put down the shelf and let the old comrades and the public satisfied."" Change the way to urge Lu Chuan to get married. Lu Tianming became famous early. At that time, he often heard people say: ""This is Lu Chuan, Lu Tianming's son."" Nowadays, as his son Lu Chuan becomes more and more famous, many people will say: ""This is Lu Tianming, Lu Chuan's father."" For this transformation, Lu Tianming is actually very happy. ""Who doesn't want their children to be promising? My son can be so successful that I really want to wake up when I sleep."" The father is a screenwriter and the son is a director. There are too many possibilities for them to cooperate in a work. For this view, Lu Tianming said that they also have this intention, ""Someone asked a long time ago whether Lu Chuan and I could make a movie together. We have this intention, but at least we haven't formed yet. Such a work must satisfy Lu Chuan and me, and we must find the best combination between our two generations, and we must be able to add one plus one to be greater than two. Otherwise, it is easy for people to think that they have a chance to make a quick buck if they make a work at will."" Many stars got married this year. In the interview, the reporter asked whether Lu Chuan and his girlfriend Qin Lan were also going to get married. For his son's lifelong大事, Lu Tianming, like all the parents of bachelors and spinsters, is in a hurry, but he smiles and says that he will not urge him, ""I will not urge him to get married, but I will ask him in a disguised way when I can hold my grandson or granddaughter in my arms to urge him."" Reporter Fang Haizheng event replay Lu Chuan Qin Lan fell in love with each other because of ""Nanjing"" In September 2009, an industry insider revealed that Lu Chuan, the director of Nanjing! Njing!

鲍文明日开发布会宣布退役防守悍将从此归隐山林新浪体育讯　北京时间9月3日消息，据美媒体projectspurs消息，在ESPN1250一档节目中爆料布鲁斯-鲍文将于明天召开一个发布会宣布正式退役。上个赛季结束之后马刺将鲍文交易去了雄鹿，换来了理查德-杰弗森。随后鲍文就被雄鹿裁掉。可是他却拒绝了来自凯尔特人的一份合约，一心想要重回圣安东尼奥。可是马刺阵中也再也没有他的位置。拥有了杰弗森和迈克尔-芬利之后，鲍文几乎不会再有表现的机会；而且马刺的薪金压力也让他们不再将鲍文放在球队的计划之中。所以最终鲍文选择退役。当然也不排除如果马刺在季后赛中发生伤病，需要一个顽强的防守者的时候，鲍文重出江湖。发布会将于明天下午2点举行。鲍文在选秀大会上落选，一直在海外打球，直到1996年加盟热火。不过一年之后热火就将他裁掉。此后，鲍文辗转波士顿凯尔特人队、费城76人队和圣安东尼奥马刺队。鲍文是现在联盟中最好的外线防守者之一，也是现在联盟中最肮脏的防守者。他依靠对防守的全神贯注，强硬的贴身干扰，对持球队员实施巨大的压力。鲍文曾经多次被指责在防守中使用有可能伤人的小动作，雷-阿伦等球员和伊塞亚-托马斯等教练都曾批评过鲍文的防守风格。在马刺鲍文迎来了职业生涯的巅峰期，他从2001年到2003年连续三年入选最佳防守二队，2004到2007年则连续入选最佳防守一队。2003、2005和2007年跟随马刺三夺总冠军。最重要的是，在马刺8年，鲍文只缺席了26场比赛，后七年只休息了3场，堪称铁人。(暖暖)	理查德-杰弗森,暖暖,鲍文,杰弗森,布鲁斯-鲍文,芬利,雷-阿伦,伊塞亚-托马斯,迈克尔-芬利	正向	Bao Wenming will hold a press conference tomorrow to announce his retirement as a tough defender, Sina Sports News On September 3, Beijing time, according to the US media projectspurs, in an ESPN1250 program, it was revealed that Bruce Bowen would hold a press conference tomorrow to announce his official retirement. After the end of last season, the Spurs traded Bowen to the Bucks for Richard Jefferson. Then Bowen was cut by the Bucks. But he rejected a contract from the Celtics and wanted to return to San Antonio. But there was no place for him in the Spurs. After having Jefferson and Michael Finley, Bowen almost had no chance to perform; Moreover, the salary pressure of the Spurs also made them no longer put Bowen in the team's plan. So in the end, Bowen chose to retire. Of course, it is not ruled out that if the Spurs suffer injuries in the playoffs and need a tenacious defender, Bowen will return to the world. The press conference will be held at 2:00 pm tomorrow. Bowen was not selected in the draft, and he has been playing overseas until he joined the Heat in 1996. But a year later, the Heat cut him. After that, Bowen went to Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers and San Antonio Spurs. Bowen is one of the best perimeter defenders in the league at present and the dirtiest defender in the league. He relied on his concentration on defense, strong adhesion and interference, and exerted great pressure on the ball handler. Bowen has been accused many times of using small actions that may hurt people in defense. Ray Allen and other players and Isaiah Thomas and other coaches have criticized Bowen's defensive style. In the Spurs, Bowen ushered in the peak of his career. He was selected as the best defense team for three consecutive years from 2001 to 2003, and the best defense team for four consecutive years from 2004 to 2007. In 2003, 2005 and 2007, he followed the Spurs to win the championship three times. Most importantly, in 8 years with the Spurs, Bowen only missed 26 games and only had a rest for 3 years in the later seven years, which can be described as an iron man. (Warm)
德邦证券：放量突破可看高一线德邦证券节后开门红的行情虽然在市场普遍预料之中，但上周沪深市场强劲走势仍然给了市场不小的惊喜。在部分经济数据反弹(PMI，VAI以及M2增速等)、政策面扶持(产业振兴规划、中央支农一号文件、创业板推出、IPO重启辟谣等)、海外市场触底反弹以及市场资金面宽松等多重因素支撑下，上周沪深两市出现了放量大涨的行情。其中沪指上涨了193.6点，涨幅达到了9.57%；深圳指数上涨了756.7点，涨幅为10.79%。两市成交量出现了显著放大，较节前交易周分别放大53.3%和60%。市场面临前期重要阻力位2100点时，仅仅用了半个交易日便完成了调整，走出放量突破的行情，市场短期强势展露无遗。由于短期内国内宏观经济看不到利空数据，处于短暂的利空数据真空期；而政策面和资金面在较为宽松的环境下还将继续推动市场走高。我们判断市场在本周内将遇到上行通道上轨2250后展开回调，市场热点仍将集中在政策受益类股票以及一、二线蓝筹股的补涨上。短期内仍可继续持有多头仓位，但在2250附近的重要阻力位置应主动减仓，防止短线出现急速回调。需要强调的是目前仍然是熊市中的反弹行情：经济基本面短期难以改善是制约市场中期上涨的主要因素，尽管政策面的扶持对市场预期有较大改善，但短期内难以根本扭转经济的下滑趋势。因此对后市行情的演绎呈谨慎乐观的态度，我们认为短期内2250附近的阻力位难以有效突破，投资者应做好随时获利止盈的准备。继国资委推出10大行业振兴规划后，汽车、钢铁和纺织、装备制造行业调整振兴规划已相继出炉，而电子信息产业的振兴规划也已提交国家发改委讨论并初步得到认可，即将成为第三批获得通过的行业振兴规划。中央在新年推出的一号文件再次将农业也纳入到积极扶持行业当中，除了家电、手机下乡以外，汽车和农机下乡也在推行之中，投资者对启动农村市场给予了较高的期盼。此外，央行也在逐步落实适度宽松的货币政策以加大金融对经济的支持力度，不仅未来存在持续降息的可能，而且货币供应增速M2出现了明显的反弹：12月增速由11月的14.8%提高了3个百分点至17.8%。作为市场领先指标M2的反弹和市场资金面的充裕都为市场走好提供了良好的外部条件。尽管海外市场基本面数据持续恶化，但市场在前期底部获得良好支撑，短期走稳对A股形成较好的外部氛围。所以综合经济基本面和政策以及外围市场因素的影响，我们认为市场短期仍将继续冲高，本周有望挑战2250点关口。鉴于冲高回落的概率在增大，建议投资者保持必要的谨慎，在高位应适当降低仓位，规避回调的风险。从纯技术面角度看，市场在面临重要技术压力位时走出了放量突破的走势，表明未来行情仍将向纵深发展。从均线形态来看，各条均线指标均呈多头排列，且沪深股指双双站稳120天的半年线，市场的中线技术指标趋于转强。从波浪形态来看，目前市场运行的上行通道下轨已经攀升至2020点一线，这将成为市场短期冲高回落后的重要支撑点位。而上行通道上轨已到达2250点一线，由于此区域为前期巨量套牢筹码区域，市场在此点位将遇到较大的抛压，短线冲高回落的概率加大。中短期的RSI和KDJ已经再次攀升到高位，且并未随股指同时创出新高，反应市场做多动能出现一定衰减，回调的技术压力在加大。综合技术面分析，我们认为本周有望冲击2250点关口，但考虑到经济基本面的因素我们依然坚持逢高减仓止盈的操作策略，短线防范冲过回调的风险。		正向	Debang Securities: The market of Hong Kong after the holiday was generally expected, but the strong performance of Shanghai and Shenzhen markets last week still gave the market a pleasant surprise. Supported by multiple factors such as the rebound of some economic data (PMI, VAI and M2 growth rate), policy support (industry revitalization plan, central government's first document to support agriculture, launch of GEM, IPO restart rumors, etc.), the bottoming out and rebound of the overseas market, and the easing of market funds, the two cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen experienced a substantial price increase last week. Among them, the Shanghai Stock Index rose 193.6 points, with a growth rate of 9.57%; Shenzhen Index rose 756.7 points, up 10.79%. The trading volume of the two cities has increased significantly, with 53.3% and 60% respectively larger than the trading week before the festival. When the market faces the important resistance level of 2100 points, it only takes half a trading day to complete the adjustment and make a volume breaking move, and the short-term strength of the market is fully exposed. Since there is no bad data in the short-term domestic macro economy, it is in a short-term bad data vacuum period; While the policy side and the funding side will continue to push the market higher in a relatively relaxed environment. We believe that the market will encounter the upper track of the 2250 line in the upward channel this week and then adjust, and the market focus will still focus on the supplementary growth of policy beneficiary stocks and first and second tier blue chip stocks. In the short term, we can still continue to hold long positions, but we should actively reduce our positions at the important resistance position near 2250 to prevent a sharp and rapid adjustment in the short term. It is necessary to emphasize that the current rebound in the bear market is still the main factor restricting the market from rising in the medium term, because the macroeconomic fundamentals are difficult to improve in the short term. Although the policy support has significantly improved the market expectations, it is difficult to fundamentally reverse the decline of the economy in the short term. Therefore, we adopt a cautious and optimistic attitude towards the evolution of the future market. We believe that the resistance near 2250 in the short term is difficult to break effectively, and investors should be ready to make profits at any time. After the SASAC launched the revitalization plan for 10 major industries, the revitalization plans for the adjustment of the automobile, steel, textile and equipment manufacturing industries have been launched one after another, and the revitalization plan for the electronic information industry has also been submitted to the National Development and Reform Commission for discussion and has been initially approved, and it will become the third batch of industry revitalization plans to be approved. The central government's No. 1 document launched in the New Year once again included agriculture in the list of actively supported industries. In addition to home appliances, mobile phones and countryside, automobiles and agricultural machinery are also being promoted, and investors have high expectations for the launch of the rural market. In addition, the central bank is also gradually implementing a moderately loose monetary policy to increase the support of finance for the economy. Not only is there a possibility of continued interest rate cuts in the future, but M2, the money supply growth rate, has also shown a significant rebound: the growth rate in December increased by 3 percentage points from 14.8% in November to 17.8%. The rebound of M2, the leading indicator of the market, and the abundance of market funds have provided good external conditions for the market to improve. Although the fundamental data of the overseas market continues to deteriorate, the market has received good support at the bottom in the earlier period, and the short-term stability has formed a good external atmosphere for A-shares. Therefore, in view of the impact of the basic economic and policy factors and the peripheral market, we believe that the market will continue to hit a new high in the short term, and this week is expected to challenge the 2250 point pass. In view of the increasing probability of retreating after hitting a new high, it is suggested that investors should maintain necessary prudence, reduce their positions appropriately at a high level, and avoid the risk of adjustment. From a purely technical perspective, the market has made a trading volume breaking move when facing important technical pressure points, indicating that the future market will still develop in depth. From the perspective of moving average shape, all moving average indicators are in a multi headed arrangement, and both Shanghai and Shenzhen stock indexes have stabilized the 120-day half year line, and the medium-term technical indicators of the market are turning to strength. From the perspective of wave shape, the lower rail of the current market's rising channel has climbed to the 2020 line, which will become an important support point for the market to retreat after a short-term surge. The upper track of the rising channel has reached the 2250 line. Since this area is the primary area of huge trapped chips, the market will encounter considerable selling pressure at this point, and the probability of a short-term surge and retreat is increasing. The RSI and KDJ of medium short term have climbed to a high level again, and they have not reached a new high with the stock index at the same time, which shows that the market's multi power is declining, and the technical pressure of adjustment is increasing. In view of the technical analysis, we believe that this week is expected to hit the 2250 pass, but considering the factors of the basic economic situation, we still stick to the operation strategy of reducing the position to stop the profit when it is high, and guard against the risk of over adjusting in the short term.

Following the irresistible momentum of the day, this morning, it further made up for the gap on October 8 in the form of a crack, and opened sharply at 8619 points. Although it lost a lot of room for rising一度due to the impact of short-term profit making and the poor performance of A-shares in China, it was beneficial for good friends to launch a new round of rising trend in the short term.

国米收获本该加盟曼城之人意大利杯将实现蓝黑首演？记者彭雷报道本周一18点50，距冬季转会市场结束只剩10分钟，国际米兰技术经理布兰卡终于把帕尔马球员马里加的合同注册到了职业联盟，23岁的肯尼亚中场成为国际米兰这个冬天的最后收购。这是笔意外的收获。事实上，马里加周一的合同本该注册到曼城那里，而国际米兰本想注册的是拉齐奥的莱德斯马或巴勒莫的辛普利西奥的合同，但一个白天发生了很多事。几天来，拉齐奥一直在与国际米兰就莱德斯马的出售问题讨价还价。周一早上的消息是，洛蒂托坚持要1000万欧元或800万欧元加一些年轻球员的租借、所有权等，但国际米兰只希望用800万现金搞定。其实差距不大，但国际米兰并没有等到洛蒂托的电话，因此开始将目标锁定在巴勒莫的巴西中场辛普利西奥身上，布兰卡也开始与赞帕里尼交涉，方式为租借。但巴勒莫希望租借国际米兰的两名年轻球员，进入一队的克尔欣以及青年队的佛萨蒂。周一中午左右，辛普里利奥已经飞到米兰，似乎签约就在眼前。国际米兰此时在询问两名年轻人的意见，但他们都不想离开。于是辛普利西奥加盟国际米兰的道路关闭了，而国际米兰在也洛蒂托依然没有回音的情况下，将目标锁定在马里加身上。几乎确定去曼城投靠曼奇尼的马里加周一上午得到了“无法办下劳工证”的消息，肯尼亚第90名的FIFA排名以及英超的一些官僚程序使马里加去曼城未果。事实上，两年前，朴茨茅斯也因为相关规定没有收购到肯尼亚人，结果被帕尔马150万欧元引入。于是，帕尔马与国际米兰走到了一起，达成了转会协议：250万欧元现金外加价值250万欧元的比亚比亚尼(去年夏天就被租借到帕尔马的前锋)的一半所有权，一起交换马里加的一半所有权。辛普利西奥略带遗憾地留在巴勒莫继续效力，而国际米兰的第一选择莱德斯马则一肚子气，其经纪人迪波利托在转会失败后大吐苦水，“现在彻底完了，一切都晚了。洛蒂托是下午16点才再去联系国际米兰的，可惜人家已经有了新目标。我之前就一直提醒洛蒂托，快没时间了，他出于所谓的自尊、骄傲，就是不给莫拉蒂主席打电话。其实从周六下午国际米兰提出最后的报价后，洛蒂托就基本同意了，他就是想等到最后时刻。结果现在他发现自己犯了错，损失了1000万欧元。现在他正试图将球员卖给曼城或热那亚，但克里斯蒂安(莱德斯马)就是想去国际米兰，所以都拒绝了。继续为拉齐奥踢球？我们再看吧，现在克里斯蒂安的心情差极了，他非常失望。”国际米兰并没有过于失望，老板莫拉蒂表示，“马里加是个惊喜？是吧，他是个年轻人，是个有意思的球员，是未来的希望，我很满意。没有买到莱德斯马？这个世界如果能节省点钱也不是坏事，我只是为球员感到遗憾，但这不是世界末日。”但也有不好的声音，在位于莱科省的莫拉蒂的一处别墅外的栅栏上，有人用油漆写上了“黑人够了！”的种族标语，除了巴洛特利，更是指刚刚收购的这位非洲中场。马里加已被穆里尼奥招入对佛罗伦萨的意大利杯大名单，穆里尼奥表示，“马里加我看到了，他刚刚伤愈，但训练很不错，所以我招他入名单。我是否满意这个收购？是的，我需要一名中场，而且马里加并不是已经成型的球员，他还年轻还在成长，我喜欢这样的球员。”	穆里尼奥,莱德斯马,拉齐奥,彭雷,马里加,佛萨蒂,辛普利西奥,克尔欣,布兰卡,辛普里利奥,曼奇尼,肯尼亚,巴洛特利,莫拉蒂,洛蒂托,克里斯蒂安,迪波利托,比亚比亚尼	正向	"Inter Milan harvests the man who should have joined Manchester City, and the Italian Cup will achieve the debut of the black and blue? Journalist Peng Lei reported that at 18:50 on Monday, only 10 minutes away from the end of the winter transfer market, Inter Milan's technical manager Blanca finally registered the contract of Parma player Mariga with the Professional League, and the 23 year old Kenyan midfielder became Inter Milan's last acquisition this winter. This is an unexpected harvest. In fact, Mariga's contract on Monday should have been registered with Manchester City, and Inter Milan wanted to register the contract of Ledesma of Lazio or Simplício of Palermo, but a lot of things happened in one day. For several days, Lazio has been bargaining with Inter Milan on the sale of Ledesma. The news on Monday morning was that Lotito insisted on 10 million euros or 8 million euros plus the lease, ownership and so on of some young players, but Inter Milan only hoped to fix it with 8 million cash. In fact, the gap is not big, but Inter Milan did not wait for Lotito's call, so it began to focus on Simplício, the Brazilian midfielder of Palermo, and Blanca also began to negotiate with Zamparini, who was on loan. But Palermo wants to lease two young players of Inter Milan, Kexin, who has entered the team, and Fosatti, who is in the youth team. Around noon on Monday, Simplício had flown to Milan, and it seemed that the signing was at hand. At this time, Inter Milan was asking for the opinions of the two young people, but they didn't want to leave. As a result, the road for Simplício to join Inter Milan was closed, and Inter Milan still didn't get any reply from Lotito, so he focused on Mariga. Mariga, who was almost sure to go to Manchester City to join Mancini, received the news that ""he could not get a labor certificate"" on Monday morning. The 90th rank of Kenya in FIFA and some bureaucratic procedures of the Premier League made Mariga fail to go to Manchester City. In fact, two years ago, Portsmouth also failed to acquire Kenyans due to relevant regulations, and was introduced by Parma for 1.5 million euros. As a result, Parma and Inter Milan came together and reached a transfer agreement: a cash of 2.5 million euros plus half ownership of Biabani (a forward who was loaned to Parma last summer) worth 2.5 million euros in exchange for half ownership of Mariga. Simplício stayed in Palermo to continue playing with a slight regret, while Ledesma, the first choice of Inter Milan, was full of anger. His agent Di Polito complained bitterly after the transfer failed. ""Now it's completely over, everything is too late. Lotito didn't contact Inter Milan again until 16:00 p.m., unfortunately, they already had a new target. I have been reminding Lotito that there is no time left, and he did not call Moratti, the chairman, out of so-called self respect and pride. In fact, after Inter Milan made the final offer on Saturday afternoon, Lotito basically agreed, and he just wanted to wait until the last moment. Now he finds that he has made a mistake and lost 10 million euros. Now he is trying to sell the player to Manchester City or Genoa, but Christian (Ledesma) wants to go to Inter Milan, so he rejected it. Continue to play for Lazio? Let's see, now Christian is in a very bad mood, he is very disappointed."" Inter Milan is not too disappointed. The boss Moratti said, ""Mariga is a surprise? Yes, he is a young and interesting player, the hope of the future, I am very satisfied. I didn't buy Ledesma? If the world can save some money, it's not a bad thing. I just feel sorry for the players, but it's not the end of the world."" But there are also bad voices. On the fence outside a villa of Moratti in Lecco Province, someone wrote the racial slogan of ""enough black people!"" In addition to Balotelli, it also refers to the African midfielder who has just been acquired. Mariga has been invited by Mourinho to the big list of the Italian Cup against Florence, and Mourinho said, ""I have seen Mariga. He has just recovered from injury, but he has trained very well, so I invite him to the list. Do I like this acquisition? Yes, I need a midfielder, and Mariga is not a mature player. He is still young and growing. I like this kind of player."""

瑞士再保险：香港与内地对保险业态度大相径庭舒时瑞士再保险公司昨天(6月15日)披露了《瑞士再保险2009年亚太区风险取向调查》，结果显示，香港与内地的消费者对保险的取向态度各异。其中香港人更偏爱冒险，而内地消费者则更为保守。瑞士再保险的这份报告针对的是亚太区年龄介乎20至40岁的成年人。其风险取向的结果显示，即使在全球性经济低迷的情况下，大部分香港中小企仍愿意积极借贷以争取业务增长。而且，香港消费者是亚太区内最不愿使用专业财务策划服务的一群；不过，面对甲型H1N1流感的威胁，很多香港受访者表示会检讨他们的保单。为了便于比较不同市场的数据及追踪长远变化，调查结果综合为两个指数，即瑞士再保险亚太区消费者风险取向指数(CAFRI)和中小企风险取向指数(BAFRI)。两个指数越高，均代表越偏好风险。香港人不喜欢用财务策划从消费者风险态度来看，香港消费者的风险取向在亚太区排名第二。调查发现，20至40岁的香港人CAFRI值高达47.8，在受访的八个亚太区市场中风险取向排名第二高，仅次于澳大利亚人。瑞士再保险经济研究及咨询部亚太区主管黄硕辉认为，香港人排名较高的原因在于他们对就业和健康的风险取向较高，在亚太区中排名第二。至于财务和生活方式，香港人较抗拒冒险，在亚太区排在中间位置。此外，调查结果确认，20至30岁的香港男士较愿意冒险。从报告来看，内地的受访者则比较保守，CAFRI值为43.4，排名第六。这部分显示，内地在就业和健康方面仍然处于劣势，并导致消费者在这方面行动较为保守。从财务规划来看，尽管76%的香港受访者非常关注如何保障未来的财务状况，只有54%的受访者表示有具体落实的计划。“香港消费者愿意使用专业财务策划服务的程度在亚太区是最低的，只有17%的受访者认为有必要使用这些服务。”黄硕辉说，“(保险)业界需要付出更多努力，以提高公众对尽早策划财务重要性的意识，并使他们明白合资格的专业理财顾问能助其作出更完善的财务规划。专业理财顾问亦需维持并提升专业水平，以提高公众对他们的信心。金融产品的销售应以顾客的需求为本。”事实上，从雷曼迷你债券和近期曝光的摩根士丹利精明债券事件都表明，香港人对自己的投资决策过于自信。相比之下，有超过20%的内地消费者认可专业财务策划的作用。内地企业家更愿承担风险或许最值得关注的是，这次调查显示，缺乏融资手段的内地企业更愿意承担融资风险。在八个市场的企业调查中，香港中小企对商业风险取向相对较低，BAFRI值只有32.1，在亚太区八个市场中排名第六，仅高于马来西亚和印度。而内地受访者的BAFRI值为35.4，显示出他们更愿意承担商业风险，在亚太区中小企风险取向中名列第二。黄硕辉表示，逾半数以上的内地中小企受访者视目前的金融危机为发展业务的机遇，乐观程度高于香港地区和印度的受访者。相比之下，68%的香港受访者希望透过内部增长而非收购来实现业务扩张，而70%的受访者不愿拓展新产品或业务。不过，异常多的香港(71%)和内地(74%)的中小企受访者表示，如果能有助业务迅速增长，他们非常愿意增加借贷。黄硕辉认为，即使在目前严峻的金融危机压力下，面对业务发展变量增加，作为香港经济增长动力的中小企仍然没有完全放弃业务发展的机会或意愿，这在某程度上反映了政府政策上的支持，能够获取信贷将鼓励中小企提高其财务杠杆水平。黄硕辉没有解释为什么内地企业家的风险承受程度如此之高，但有一点可以肯定，这些企业家并没有像香港中小企业那些获得足够的信贷支持，他们的愿望或许更多反映出内地企业家的融资困难。	黄硕辉	正向	"Swiss Reinsurance: Hong Kong and the mainland have quite different attitudes towards the insurance industry. Swiss Reinsurance yesterday (June 15) disclosed the ""Swiss Reinsurance 2009 Asia Pacific Risk Orientation Survey"", which shows that consumers in Hong Kong and the mainland have different attitudes towards insurance. Hong Kong people prefer to take risks, while consumers in the mainland are more conservative. The report of Swiss Reinsurance targets adults aged 20 to 40 in the Asia Pacific region. Its risk orientation results show that even in the case of global economic depression, most small and medium enterprises in Hong Kong are willing to actively borrow to strive for business growth. Moreover, Hong Kong consumers are the group least willing to use professional financial planning services in the Asia Pacific region; However, in the face of the threat of influenza A (H1N1), many Hong Kong respondents said they would review their policies. In order to facilitate the comparison of data in different markets and track long-term changes, the survey results are combined into two indicators, namely Swiss Re Asia Pacific Consumer Risk Orientation Index (CAFRI) and SME Risk Orientation Index (BAFRI). The higher the two indexes, the more risk they prefer. Hong Kong people don't like to use financial planning. From the perspective of consumer risk attitude, Hong Kong consumers' risk orientation ranks second in the Asia Pacific region. The survey found that the CAFRI value of Hong Kong people aged 20 to 40 was as high as 47.8, ranking second highest in terms of risk orientation among the eight Asia Pacific markets interviewed, second only to Australians. Huang Shuohui, head of the Department of Economic Research and Consulting of Swiss Re in the Asia Pacific region, believes that the reason why Hong Kong people rank higher is that their employment and health risks rank second in the Asia Pacific region. As for finance and lifestyle, Hong Kong people are less willing to take risks, ranking in the middle of the Asia Pacific region. In addition, the survey results confirm that Hong Kong men aged 20 to 30 are more willing to take risks. According to the report, the respondents in the mainland are more conservative, with a CAFRI value of 43.4, ranking sixth. This shows that the mainland is still at a disadvantage in employment and health, which leads consumers to be more conservative in this aspect. In terms of financial planning, although 76% of the surveyed people in Hong Kong are very concerned about how to protect their future financial status, only 54% of the respondents said that they have specific implementation plans. ""Hong Kong consumers are the least willing to use professional financial planning services in the Asia Pacific region, and only 17% of the respondents think it is necessary to use these services."" Huang Shuohui said, ""(Insurance) industry needs to make more efforts to enhance the public's awareness of the importance of financial planning as early as possible, and make them understand that qualified professional financial planners can help them make better financial planning. Professional financial planners also need to maintain and improve their professional level to enhance the public's confidence in them. The sale of financial products should be based on the needs of customers."" In fact, both Lehman's minibonds and the recently publicized Morgan Stanley's smart bond incident show that Hong Kong people are too confident in their investment decisions. By contrast, more than 20% of consumers in the mainland recognize the role of professional financial planning. Chinese entrepreneurs are more willing to take risks. Perhaps the most noteworthy thing is that this survey shows that the land enterprises, which lack financing means, are more willing to take financing risks. In the enterprise survey of eight markets, the small and medium enterprises in Hong Kong have a relatively low risk orientation of 32.1, ranking sixth in the eight markets in the Asia Pacific region, just higher than Malaysia and India. The BAFRI value of the respondents in the mainland was 35.4, which shows that they are more willing to take business risks, ranking second in the SME risk orientation in the Asia Pacific region. Huang Shuohui said that more than half of the SMEs in China saw the current financial crisis as an opportunity for business development, more optimistic than the respondents in Hong Kong and India. By contrast, 68% of the respondents in Hong Kong hope to achieve business expansion through internal growth rather than acquisitions, and 70% of the respondents are not willing to expand new products or businesses. However, an abnormally large number of small and medium enterprise respondents in Hong Kong (71%) and the mainland (74%) said that they were very willing to increase borrowing if it could help their business grow rapidly. Huang Shuohui believes that even under the current severe pressure of the financial crisis, the small and medium enterprises in Hong Kong, as the growth driver of the Hong Kong economy, have not completely abandoned the opportunity or willingness to develop their business. To a certain extent, this reflects the support of government policies. The access to credit will encourage small and medium enterprises to increase their financial leverage. Huang Shuohui did not explain why the risk tolerance of entrepreneurs in China was so high, but one thing is for sure, these entrepreneurs did not get enough credit support like Hong Kong small and medium enterprises, and their wishes may reflect more financing difficulties of entrepreneurs in China."

Hong Liang Mobile phone, as a daily communication tool, has gradually integrated into people's life, and people all hope to have a mobile phone suitable for them. When it comes to buying mobile phones, some people want a bargain, while others追求high-end enjoyment. For example, the prices of most high-end mobile phones such as HTCsensation and Samsung GALAXYSII are more than 3400 yuan. This kind of model is suitable for people who have sufficient economy and pursue high-end enjoyment. However, for those friends who want to experience high-end but have a tight budget, waiting for these models to reduce prices is really a long process. Fortunately, there is a batch of models in the market that have been squeezed off the flagship throne. Although they have become mid-high-end mobile phones, their performance is no less than that, and the price is also reasonable. Just like LGP990 mobile phone, it has a dual-core processor, but the price is almost the same as HTCDesireS (parameter quotation picture forum software). Today, I'd like to bring you several mobile phones with high cost performance, hoping to provide some help to friends who are going to buy a computer in the near future. HTCDesireHD (parameter quotation picture forum software) In the second half of 2010, Android flagship computers were launched in a crowded market. The DesireHD launched by HTC has easily occupied an important place in the hearts of consumers with its excellent performance. The built-in Android intelligent operating system and the huge memory combination have a main frequency of 1GHz, which can easily handle even heavy tasks. HTCDesireHD adopts a straight touch design. The classic body shape is very fashionable. It has a 4.3 inch capacitive touch screen with a resolution of 480 × 800 pixels, which has a delicate and soft display effect. The three surrounding areas of the machine are 123 × 68 × 11.8mm, the weight is 164g, and it feels full in your hand. HTCDesireHD is equipped with AndroidOSv2.2 intelligent operating system, with HTC Sense user interface. At the same time, it is equipped with a 1024MHz CPU, which still runs smoothly even when operating multiple tasks. In terms of photography, the machine has an 8 million pixel camera with LED flash, which brings a lot of fun to your outings and parties. HTCDesireHD has a very powerful overall performance.

We should do a good job in the rotation of invigilators. The rotation is randomly arranged by the provincial dispatchers and announced 60 minutes before the examination. The invigilators shall not refuse to execute for any reason. ""School Safety Project"" has made new changes in the location of individual test centers.

高考评论：考生大幅“跳水”是个好现象今日关键词考生锐减这种现象是好事，它使“千军万马争过独木桥”现象得到缓解的同时，向全国高校发布了一个明确信息：今后，依靠垄断生源这一优势过优哉游哉的好日子，越来越不可靠了。□本报评论员岳建国今年，河南高考报名总人数85.5万人，比去年95.2万人锐减近10万人，是有史以来“跳水”幅度最大的一次。对此，省招办新闻发言人陈大琪表示，这是因为今年新课改后高考第一年，复读生比往年少了，其次是职业教育分流和人口出生的自然增减，这意味着河南考生上大学将更容易。另据业内人士分析，部分高校将因生源逐渐枯竭面临严峻生存挑战。高考报名人数出现有史以来最大幅度的“跳水”，其原因并不止上述几个，只要回顾一下我们周围的高中生的去向，就会发现还应加上“高中生直接就业和出国留学者增多”这两个因素，虽然我们没有权威的统计资料作支持。总的来说，这种现象是好事，除了考生上大学更容易外，它还使曾令我们震惊、心焦和无奈的“千军万马争过独木桥”的现象得到明显缓解，同时向全国各高校发布了一个明确的信息：今后高校必须越来越依赖教学质量、就业率和成才率而生存，依靠垄断生源这一优势耍大牌、优哉游哉的好日子，越来越不可靠了。1999年以来的高招形势是，高校盲目扩招，人口出生却自然增减，导致录取比例大幅提高，许多省份的录取率高达80%。与这个“招生大跃进”相对应的是，大批从农村进入高校的大学生“毕业即失业”，他们既不想辜负家乡父老“跳出农门”的期望，又因学无所长和没有“好”父母而无法找到满意的工作，于是便成了“蜗居”在大中城市城乡接合部的庞大“蚁族”。这种现象产生了很大的效应——导致越来越多的高中生决定另辟蹊径。比如家庭稍微好一些的高中生干脆出国留学，接受更好的教育；有的高中生尤其是农村的，干脆跟随亲朋好友到城市打工，自食其力；有的走进职业学校，将来做一个体面的技术工人。于是，全国范围的“高考报名人数逐年锐减甚至‘跳水’”的现象出现了。但这并不是坏事，是开放的环境和市场经济为考生们提供了更多的选择。想想看，普通家庭节衣缩食攒钱把孩子送到外国留学，让祖国的接班人眼界更开阔、能力更强，这不是再好不过的事情吗？过去我们一直说发达国家都很重视职业教育，美国的大学录取率才达到70%左右，我们不也是朝着这条路走吗？目前，全国各地的民营企业几乎都面临着招工难现象，高中生就业不是可以解燃眉之急吗？但是，这一现象肯定会让许多高校感到不安甚至产生压力。许多年来，他们有的大建新校区，有的大扩老校区，以便增加专业，增加班级。可他们没有想到的是，自己的招生规模刚刚扩大，突然生源就减少了，看着空荡荡的偌大校区，心里能不着急吗？但从如何提高高校教学质量这方面看，这是好事，这能让他们感觉到，无论是出国的还是到民企就业的，都是嫌他们教学质量差，都是对他们的失望和抛弃，都在逼他们猛醒、改革，向一流高校看齐，促使高校之间出现有效的竞争，最终导致中国高校教学质量的整体提高。	陈大琪,岳建国	正向	"Today's key word is that the sharp reduction of examinees is a good phenomenon, which alleviates the phenomenon of ""thousands of troops competing for a single wooden bridge"", and sends a clear message to colleges and universities across the country: in the future, it is less and less reliable to rely on the advantage of monopolizing students. □ Y岳建国, commentator of this newspaper, this year, the total number of students in Henan Province who registered for the高考was 855000, nearly 100000 less than 952000 last year, the largest ""diving"" in history. Chen Daqi, spokesman of the provincial recruitment office, said that this was because this year was the first year after the new curriculum reform, and the number of repeaters was less than in previous years. The second was the natural increase and decrease of vocational education and population birth, which meant that it would be easier for students in Henan Province to go to college. According to industry insiders, some universities will face severe survival challenges due to the gradual depletion of students. The ""diving"" of the largest number of students registered for the高考in history is not just the above reasons. If we look back at the destination of the high school students around us, we will find that we should add two factors: ""high school students can get more direct employment and go abroad for further study"", although we do not have authoritative statistical data to support them. In general, this phenomenon is a good thing. In addition to the fact that it is easier for students to go to college, it has also significantly alleviated the phenomenon of ""thousands of troops competing for a single wooden bridge"" that shocked, worried and helpless us, and at the same time, it has sent a clear message to colleges and universities across the country: in the future, universities must rely more and more on teaching quality, employment rate and success rate to survive. The good days of relying on the advantage of monopolizing students to play big cards and have a good time are less and less reliable. Since 1999, the situation of high recruitment has been that colleges and universities blindly expand enrollment, while the population is naturally increasing and decreasing, resulting in a substantial increase in the admission ratio, and the admission rate in many provinces is as high as 80%. Corresponding to this ""big leap forward in recruitment"", a large number of college students who have entered universities from rural areas ""graduate and become unemployed"". They do not want to live up to the expectation of their hometown's parents to ""jump out of the farmer's door"", and they cannot find a satisfactory job because they have no special skills and no ""good"" parents, so they become a huge ""ant tribe"" "" living in the junction of urban and rural areas of large and medium cities. This phenomenon has a great effect - it leads to more and more high school students to decide to open up new ways. For example, high school students with slightly better families simply go abroad for further study to receive better education; Some high school students, especially those in rural areas, simply follow their relatives and friends to work in cities and rely on their own abilities; Some people go to vocational schools to be a decent technical worker in the future. As a result, the phenomenon of ""year on year sharp reduction or even 'diving'"" of college entrance examination applicants across the country has emerged. But this is not a bad thing. It is the open environment and the market economy that provide more choices for candidates. Think about it. It's great that ordinary families save money to send their children to study abroad in order to make the successors of the motherland have a broader vision and stronger abilities. In the past, we always said that developed countries attach great importance to vocational education, and the university admission rate in the United States has reached about 70%. Are we not going in this way? At present, private enterprises almost all over the country are facing the problem of recruitment. Is it not possible for high school students to find jobs? However, this phenomenon will definitely make many colleges and universities feel uneasy or under pressure. For many years, some of them have built new campuses and some have expanded old campuses in order to increase majors and classes. But they didn't expect that their招生scale had just expanded, and suddenly the students decreased. Looking at the huge empty campus, can they not be in a hurry? But from the perspective of how to improve the teaching quality of colleges and universities, this is a good thing, which can make them feel that those who go abroad or go to private enterprises for employment blame them for their poor teaching quality, and they are disappointed and abandoned, forcing them to wake up and reform, align with first-class universities, and promote effective competition between universities, ultimately leading to the overall improvement of teaching quality of Chinese universities."
QDII队伍壮大上半年有望达到40只证券时报记者余子君今年合格境内机构投资者(QDII)发行提速，截至昨日，已经成立了10只QDII，算上正在发行和即将发行的QDII，上半年QDII有望冲击40只大关。天相投顾数据显示，截至昨日，今年已经成立的QDII达到37只，华安大中华升级基金也于4月18日开始募集，按一个月的募集期限计算，该基金将于近期结束募集。除此之外，日前获批的广发标普全球农业指数基金也将于近期发行。而富国基金于去年11月15日上报了全球顶级消费品股票型基金，按照6个月的审批流程计算，如果该基金获批后立即投入发行，上半年，QDII基金只数将达到40只。事实上，从证监会公布的基金募集申请核准进度公示表来看，除了广发标普全球农业指数基金和富国全球顶级消费品股票型基金之外，还有7只QDII已经递交了申请材料，正在等待获批。2009年底QDII审批重启之后，基金公司发行热情高涨，今年发行更加火爆。截至昨日，今年以来已经成立了10只QDII产品，还有1只正在发行，1只即将发行，8只QDII已经递交募集申请，等待获批。而去年全年共计成立了18只QDII，其中上半年成立7只，下半年成立11只。从基金公司角度来看，目前已经拥有QDII产品的基金公司达到27家，占比近半。其中，博时、南方、易方达和嘉实等大型基金公司已经拥有2只QDII产品。如果算上即将发行和已经递交了募集申请材料的基金公司，那么嘉实和南方2家基金公司即将迎来旗下第3只QDII产品，诺安、广发、汇添富、富国、国泰4家基金公司也将拥有2只QDII产品，而景顺长城和国海富兰克林基金公司也将迎来旗下首只QDII产品。从产品特点来看，与首批出海的QDII相比，近两年，基金公司更注重产品创新。如专注黄金投资的诺安黄金以及易方达黄金基金、专注全球债券市场的富国全球债券基金、专注指数化投资的国泰纳斯达克100指数基金、嘉实恒生H股、大成标普500、长信标普100、广发标普全球农业指数基金等。除此之外，诺安基金今年还上报了国内首只油气能源基金。基金业内人士指出，2008年下半年QDII审批一度被暂停，2009年底审批放开后，基金公司为了完善产品线，发行QDII产品热情大增，目前大型基金公司基本拥有2只QDII产品，少数仅拥有1只QDII产品的大型基金公司也在加紧筹备第2只产品。上海一家基金公司人士表示，虽然QDII发行如火如荼，但是，由于QDII业务运作成本比较高，目前不少基金公司都是亏本运作，对于中小型基金公司来说，如果不是为了完善产品线，发行动力并不足。已经拥有2只QDII产品基金公司一览基金公司名称一季度末含联接基金资产管理规模(亿元)公司成立时间博时基金1135.771998－7－13工银瑞信554.632005－6－21海富通基金416.762003－4－18华宝兴业基金423.402003－3－7嘉实基金1506.301999－3－25南方基金1171.361998－3－6上投摩根基金556.262004－5－12易方达基金1589.132001－4－17银华基金786.442001－5－28招商基金390.402002－12－27数据来源：天相投顾余子君／制表	余子君	正向	The QDII team is expected to reach 40 securities in the first half of the year. Yu Zijun, a journalist from Securities Times, reported that the issuance of Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) has accelerated this year. As of yesterday, 10 QDIIs had been established, and the number of QDIIs is expected to hit the 40 mark in the first half of the year, including those being issued and to be issued. Tian Xiang's investment advisory data shows that as of yesterday, the QDIIs established this year have reached 37. Hua An Dat Zhonghua Upgrade Fund also began to raise funds on April 18. According to the one-month fundraising deadline, the fundraising of the Fund will end soon. In addition, the recently approved GF S&P Global Agriculture Index Fund will also be issued soon. Fuguo Fund also reported the global top consumer goods stock fund to the top on November 15 last year. According to the six-month approval process, if the fund is immediately put into circulation after approval, the number of QDII funds will reach 40 in the first half of the year. In fact, according to the fund raising application approval progress display form published by the CSRC, in addition to the GF S&P Global Agricultural Index Fund and Fuguo Global Top Consumer Goods Stock Fund, 7 QDIIs have submitted application materials and are waiting for approval. Since the restart of QDII approval at the end of 2009, fund companies have been enthusiastic about issuance, and this year's issuance has been more popular. As of yesterday, 10 QDII products have been established this year, one is being issued, one is going to be issued, and 8 QDIIs have submitted fundraising applications and are waiting for approval. Last year, a total of 18 QDII were established, including 7 in the first half of the year and 11 in the second half of the year. From the perspective of fund companies, there are 27 fund companies that currently have QDII products, accounting for nearly half. Among them, large fund companies such as Boshi, NSSF, E Fund and Jiaxin have two QDII products. If we include the fund companies that are going to be issued and have submitted application materials, Jiaxin and NSSF will welcome their third QDII product under their jurisdiction, and four fund companies, including Nuoan, GF, Huitianfu, Fuguo, and Guotai, will also have two QDII products, and Jingzhao Changcheng and Guohai Franklin Fund will also welcome their first QDII product under their jurisdiction. From the perspective of product characteristics, compared with the first batch of QDIIs going to sea, fund companies have paid more attention to product innovation in recent two years. Such as Nuoan Gold, which focuses on gold investment, Yifangda Gold Fund, Fuguo Global Bond Fund, which focuses on the global bond market, Guotai Nasdaq 100 Index Fund, which focuses on index investment, Jiazhong H-shares, Dacheng S & P 500, Changxin S & P 100, GF S & P Global Agricultural Index Fund, etc. In addition, Nuoan Fund also reported the first oil and gas energy fund in China this year. Fund industry insiders pointed out that the approval of QDII was once suspended in the second half of 2008. After the approval was released at the end of 2009, fund companies were very enthusiastic about issuing QDII products in order to improve the product line. At present, large fund companies basically have two QDII products, and some large fund companies with only one QDII product are also stepping up the preparation of the second product. A person from a fund company in Shanghai said that although QDII issuance was in full swing, since the operation cost of QDII business was relatively high, at present, many fund companies were operating at a loss. For small and medium-sized fund companies, if they did not want to improve the product line, they did not have enough motivation to issue.

新大洲：被严重忽视的新能源电池概念方正证券赵玉涛继新能源电池板块中一线品种杉杉股份、西藏矿业、科力远等连续飙升、富贵逼人之后，今日该板块中的二三线品种中金瑞科技、佛塑股份等品种强势涨停，再度将市场人气充分激活！受其刺激，中信国安、中国宝安、福田汽车等相关新能源电池产业链受益品种亦以长阳报收。回顾近期盘面，新能源电池板块中诸如西藏矿业、杉杉股份、中信国安、中国宝安等品种无不演绎新能源电池的造福神话。可以说，一时间新能源电池风起云涌、黑马奔腾！独无有偶，此前针对奥巴马胜选的期望，让美国能源巨头FirstSolarInc.(FSLR)股价大涨。显然，一股新能源电池热正在全球股市掀起，其背后推动力正是美国新总统奥巴马推出未来十年1500亿美元新能源计划。因此，可以说新能源电池的市场前景超出想象，相关上市公司无疑将面临重大的投资机遇。此外，新能源电池板块经过一轮狂飙，整体估值得以全线大幅提升，给新能源电池相关品种带来极大的投资机会，尤其是一些未被市场所发掘的二三线品种，像今天强势涨停的金瑞科技和佛塑股份，就是最典型的例证！因此，我们认为，一直未有表现的同类品种新大洲(000571)值得投资者重点关注！资料显示，新大洲(000571)参股的大连新源动力是中国燃料电池领域规模最大的企业，在国内率先实现了燃料电池实验室科研成果向现实生产力的转化，由新源动力等单位提供动力系统的帕萨特领驭氢燃料电池轿车已经作为公务用车在奥运中心区进行了示范运营；同时，新大洲(000571)旗下的上海新大洲电动车有限公司专业进行电动自行车的研发、制造和销售。那么，在新能源电池板块中一线品种全线大幅飙升、二三线品种黑马奔腾的大背景下，新能源动力领域题材非常正宗和丰富的新大洲(000571)无疑被市场严重忽视，相信该股必将复制前述同类品种所连续涨停的神话！奥巴马发力新能源突破口在燃料电池事实上，自参选之日起，奥巴马就显示出对新能源产业的极大关注。产业政策中对新能源做出了极大倾斜，未来十年将投入1500亿美元资助替代能源的研究，并为相关公司提供税务优惠；发展清洁能源，大幅减少对中东和委内瑞拉石油的依赖；计划到2012年，美国发电量的10%将来自可再生能源等。其中，奥巴马对新能源汽车的青睐尤为引人注目，目前盛传将采用混合动力凯迪拉克作为白宫座驾。奥巴马在竞选时承诺，计划以7000美元的抵税额度鼓励消费者购买节能型汽车；动用40亿美元的联邦政府资金支持汽车公司推进新能源车的销售，到2015年使美国的混合动力汽车销量达到100万辆。显然，奥巴马未来能源计划中的核心焦点，就集中在新能源动力汽车。资料显示，燃料电池是举世公认的高效、便捷及有益于环境的绿色能源装置。它利用氢和氧生成水的过程来产生电力的一种装置。所依据的原理，是中学课程中“水的电解”反应的逆反应。因为是将燃料通过化学反应释放出能量变为电能输出，所以被称为“燃料电池”。目前广泛研发的燃料电池有质子交换膜燃料电池(PEMFC)、直接甲醇燃料电池(DMFC)、碱性燃料电池(AFC)等。其中，质子交换膜燃料电池(PEMFC)因其不经过燃烧直接以电化学反应连续地把燃料和氧化剂中的化学能直接转换成电能，具有能量转换效率高(一般都在40%～50%，而内燃机仅为18%～24%)、无污染、启动快、电池寿命长、比功率、比能量高等优点，成为应用最广的一类燃料电池。该技术已被美国、加拿大等发达国家认定为21世纪首选的清洁能源系统。	赵玉涛,奥巴马	正向	"New Continent: The seriously ignored new energy battery concept Fang Zheng Securities Zhao Yutao continued to soar after the first line of new energy battery sector, such as Fuxi Mining, Shanxin Shares, and Keliyuan, and then the second and third line varieties in the sector, such as Zhongjinrui Technology and Fosu Shares, were once again fully activated by a strong market! Stimulated by it, CITIC Guoan, China Baoan, Foton Motor and other related new energy battery industry chain benefited varieties also reported on Changyang. Looking back on the recent trading day, varieties such as Tibet Mining, Shanxin Shares, CITIC Guoan, China Baoan and so on in the new energy battery sector have all demonstrated the myth of benefiting new energy batteries. It can be said that for a time, new energy batteries are surging and dark horses are galloping! In a unique way, the previous expectation of Obama's victory let the American energy giant FirstSolarInc. (FSLR) soar. Obviously, a new energy battery heat wave is sweeping the global stock market, and the driving force behind it is the new US President Obama's launch of a $150 billion new energy plan for the next decade. Therefore, it can be said that the market prospects of new energy batteries exceed imagination, and the relevant listed companies will undoubtedly face significant investment opportunities. In addition, after a round of crazy spree of new energy battery板块, the overall valuation has been significantly improved, which has brought great investment opportunities to new energy battery related varieties, especially some second and third tier varieties that have not been discovered by the market, such as Jinrui Technology and Fosu Shares, which were strongly rising today, are the most typical examples! Therefore, we believe that the new continent (000571) of the same kind of varieties that has not been performing deserves the attention of investors! Data shows that Dalian New Source Power, a subsidiary of Xindazhou (000571), is the largest enterprise in the field of fuel cells in China. It has realized the transformation of laboratory scientific research achievements of fuel cells into realistic productivity for the first time in China. The Passat Lingyu hydrogen fuel cell car, which is provided with power systems by New Source Power and other units, has been demonstrated and operated as a public service vehicle in the Olympic Center; At the same time, Shanghai Xindazhou Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Xindazhou (000571), specializes in the research, development, manufacturing and sales of electric bicycles. Then, in the context of the whole line of first-line varieties in the new energy battery sector surging and the second and third line varieties of dark horses galloping, the new and very authentic and rich Continent (000571) in the field of new energy power is undoubtedly seriously ignored by the market. It is believed that the stock will surely replicate the myth of continuous price limit of the aforementioned similar varieties! Obama focuses on the breakthrough of new energy in fuel cells. In fact, since the election, Obama has shown great concern for the new energy industry. The industrial policy makes a great tilt to new energy. In the future decade, 150 billion dollars will be invested to sponsor the research of alternative energy and provide tax benefits to relevant companies; Develop clean energy and drastically reduce dependence on Middle Eastern and Venezuelan oil; By 2012, 10% of the power generation in the United States will come from renewable energy. In particular, Obama's favor for new energy vehicles is particularly eye-catching. At present, it is widely rumored that a hybrid Cadillac will be used as the White House limousine. Obama promised during his campaign that he would encourage consumers to buy energy-saving cars with a tax credit of $7000; Mobilize 4 billion dollars of federal government funds to support automobile companies in promoting the sales of new energy vehicles, so that the sales of hybrid electric vehicles in the United States will reach 1 million by 2015. Obviously, the core focus of Obama's future energy plan is focused on new energy power vehicles. Data show that fuel cells are widely recognized as efficient, convenient and beneficial green energy devices. It is a device that uses hydrogen and oxygen to generate water to generate electricity. The principle is the reverse reaction of the ""electrolysis of water"" reaction in the middle school curriculum. Because it is called ""fuel cell"" because it converts the energy released by fuel through chemical reaction into electric energy output. At present, the widely developed fuel cells include proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), alkaline fuel cell (AFC), etc. Among them, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are the most widely used fuel cells because they directly convert the chemical energy of fuel and oxidant into electric energy through electrochemical reactions without combustion, with high energy conversion efficiency (generally more than 40% ~ 50%, while internal combustion engines are only 18% ~ 24%), no pollution, fast start-up, long battery life, high specific power, and high specific energy. This technology has been recognized as the first choice of clean energy system in the 21st century by developed countries such as the United States and Canada."
经验交流：司法考试是一个斗智斗勇的过程我是第一年参加司法考试，今年考了434分。我觉得司法考试是一个斗智斗勇的过程，现在我把我的一些体会分三个阶段与大家一起分享！我是从三月中旬开始准备的，因为是第一次考，心理没有底，所以准备比较早。那时也是摸着石头过河，脑海里对考试的内容都没有一个系统的体系，有点觉得胡子眉毛一把抓，也许是以前的功底还不错，有时觉得有些意想不到的效果，就这么样混混沌沌的一个半月过去了。这时朋友建议我去报个班，可能对我有帮助，我报了一个周末和晚上上课的班，可以自由安排时间，哪天学累了可以自主决定休息，就这么样我跟着老师的进度学习。在老师的引导下，学习效率大大提高，有些不懂的地方也迎刃而解，学得如鱼得水！今年的卷三得了122分。第二阶段是7月到8月了，这段时间离考试不到三个月了，马上就要开奥运会了，前一段时间去找自习室，折腾了几个星期，挪来挪去，学习计划一度被打乱，最远的还去过海淀图书馆，可离住的地方实在太远，花在坐车的时间来回也得4个小时，太不划算了，大热天，心里更加烦躁，想来想去，只有回家看书了，在老家呆在自己的房间里，虽然安静，可没有人与我交流，我只有每天发短信或者上网与司考同路人交流，这么样就可以知道他们的进度，看看自己有没有落后，哪个知识点掌握的不好，每天只规定自己看六个小时，但必须要有效率，剩下的时间奖励自己看奥运比赛，基本比较重要的比赛我都没有落过。第三阶段就到就9月了，回到北京我就开始把从03到07真题认认真真地做了一遍，把做错的地方找找相关的知识再看看。剩下的时间把论述稍微看了一下，我是觉得第四卷没有必要下工夫，因为如果把前三卷的基本功打好了，第四卷基本上没有太大的问题，只要做到卷面干净，字迹清楚就可以了！俗话说：台下十年工，台上一分钟。临场发挥也很重要，这个时候比的是心理素质了。我还是比较紧张的，卷二刚刚发下来，就听见老师说有人卷一没有用A4铅笔填准考证号，我猛然发现自己就没有填，心理老想着会不会卷一作废，所以考卷二时心里有杂念，怪自己的粗心大意，结果卷二考得有点失常，刑诉错得有点离谱，考完后结果是虚惊一场，监考老师说就是没有填准考证号他们也帮填了，晚上一直懊悔卷二考砸了，但想也没有用了，只有在下面的考试中挽回局面，提起精神把第二天的要考的好好看看一下，结果第二天很快就调整过来了，写得很顺手！今年在司法考试上算是圆满结局了，但往后的法律路还很漫长，得不断学习！不断进取！路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索！更多信息请访问：新浪司法频道司法考试论坛司法考试博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。		正向	Experience sharing: The judicial examination is a process of wisdom and courage. I am a first year student who took the judicial examination. This year, I scored 434. I think the judicial examination is a process of wisdom and courage. Now I would like to share some of my experiences with you in three stages! I started preparing in mid March, because it was the first time for me to take the exam, I had no bottom in my heart, so I prepared early. At that time, I was also crossing the river by feeling the stones. There was no systematic system in my mind about the content of the examination. I felt like a beard and eyebrows. I grabbed them. Maybe the previous foundation was good. Sometimes I felt some unexpected effects. In this way, a chaotic one and a half months passed. At this time, my friends suggested me to go to a class, which may be helpful to me. I applied for a class on weekends and evenings, which can be arranged freely. I can decide to have a rest on the day when I am tired of learning. In this way, I followed the teacher's progress. Under the guidance of the teacher, the learning efficiency has been greatly improved, and some problems that I don't understand have been solved, and I have learned like fish in water! The third volume scored 122 this year. The second stage is from July to August. There is less than three months before the examination. The Olympic Games will open soon. In the past few weeks, I went to look for a self study room, moved around, and the study plan was once disrupted. The farthest one went to Haidian Library, but it was too far away from the living place. It was not worth four hours to spend on driving back and forth. In the hot summer, I was more annoyed. After thinking about it, I had to go home and read. Staying in my own room in my hometown was quiet, but no one could communicate with me. I had to send text messages or surf the Internet every day to communicate with people on the same road as the judicial examination, so that I could know their progress, see if I was left behind, and which knowledge point was not well mastered. I only allowed myself to read for six hours a day, but it must be efficient. The remaining time was rewarded to watch the Olympic Games. I basically didn't miss the most important events. The third stage is in September. When I returned to Beijing, I began to carefully do the true questions from 03 to 07, and then look for the relevant knowledge where I made mistakes. The remaining time was spent on skimming the discussion. I think there is no need to make efforts in the fourth volume, because if the basic skills of the first three volumes are well prepared, there is no big problem in the fourth volume. Just make sure that the test paper is clean and the handwriting is clear! As the saying goes: ten years of work off the stage, one minute on the stage. It is also important to play on the spot. At this time, it is a matter of psychological quality. I was still very nervous. When the second volume was just issued, I heard the teacher say that someone didn't use A4 pencil to fill in the examination number. I suddenly found that I didn't fill it in. I always thought that the first volume might be invalid, so when I took the second volume, I had杂thoughts in my mind and blamed myself for being careless. As a result, the second volume was a bit abnormal, and the criminal complaint was a bit outrageous. After the examination, it was a false alarm. The invigilator said that they also filled in the examination number without filling it in. I regretted that the second volume failed until the evening, but it was useless. I had to make up in the following examinations. I had to pick up my spirits and have a good look at what I will take the next day. As a result, the next day was quickly adjusted, and it was very easy to write! This year's judicial examination was considered a happy ending, but the future legal road is still long, and we must keep learning! Keep making progress! The road is long and far, I will try my best!

电信系广电系内部融合加速电信系广电系内部融合加速统一监管或成三网融合制度基础■本报记者沈加军2月6日，中国电信的“家庭信息第四屏——魔屏mTouch”在上海国美徐汇店上柜露面，“魔屏mTouch”采用八英寸显示屏，集合了手机、电视以及电脑三屏优势，。也是在上周，据中国有线电视网络有限公司透露，有线电视网省内整合已彻底完成的省份达到13个，同时有10个省份正在推进此项工作。单独看两方面各自的融合速度，不可谓不大，但是，整个中国的三网融合进程缺只能用缓慢来标注。难题仍然是原来的难题，行业老专家舒华英一语道破，实现三网融合首先要探讨统一监管问题。统一监管机构是三网融合的制度基础从过来的三网融合经验可看出，设立融合管制机构，对网络实行统一监管都是三网融合实现突破的基础，典型国家包括英国、美国、加拿大、日本等。2003年英国依据《2003年通信法》设立了融合性的监管机构OFCOM?英国通信管理局，彻底打破了原来信息领域中存在的各种壁垒，使技术和业务得到进一步融合。而美国监管机构FCC?联邦通信委员会本来就是一个融合性监管机构，其监管范围包括公共电信、专用电信、广播电视等。日本在总务省下面设立了信息通信政策局和综合通信基础局，同时监管电信和广播业。但在国内，由于面临利益和政策上的障碍，迟迟无法取得突破。舒华英教授表示，由于广电与电信分属于两个不同的部门管理，因此三网融合中的部门利益协调依然是一个大难题，广电和电信之间壁垒森严的难题未解决的直接后果就是已经争论了十几年的三网融合问题将被无限期搁浅。因此，要真正实现三网融合，信息服务业、通信、广播以及借助网络的新兴媒体等需要更高层面的监管机构来行使监管职权。应该建立国家信息监管委员会，利用这一监管平台进行单纯监管，实现政企分离。相互准入实现市场化运营是前提在三网融合的实践上来看，目前多数国家直接允许相互进入。英国立法明确规定准许传统广电和电信双向进入，同时对电信业采取竞争开放的监管办法，对广电业的准入相对严格一些。德国和印度两国的电信企业在提供融合性服务上已经不存在法律障碍。三网融合的发展要充分发挥市场机制的作用，市场机制是推进三网融合的前提。从国内实际来看，三网融合确实改变了广电与电信相互隔离的外部关系，但双方各自独立的内在特性依然存在。但是三网融合发展趋势不可逆转，尤其在当前金融危机的背景下，三网融合需求显得更为迫切。虽然广电一直在推进改革，但是不时也传出广电“既做运动员，又做裁判员”等不符合市场经济规律的事件，黄石广电叫停IPTV、莆田广电强推数字电视等可见一斑。广电方面应加快市场化改革的步伐，广电本身实现“制播分离”，即内容和传输分离是比较可行的办法，三网融合也就水到渠成了。三网融合超越一切利益之争目前全球经济的复苏主要得益于各国经济刺激方案的短期作用。国家的一系列内政措施，都与拉动内需、创造新经济增长点有关。发放3G牌照、加速三网融合，都是按这方向走棋，是超越集团利益之上的决策。站在这个立场上，就不难理解国家所订下的紧迫的融合时间表。三网融合对广播电视网来说极其艰难，广播电视网目前是全国四级(省地市县)各自独立为政格局，网络统一首先必须体制改革，从行政事业部门分离出来，建立企业管理模式。亦即脱离广电局成立独立的网络集团，组成“第四网络运营商”，参与网络产业竞争。对电信业来说，当前内容瓶颈仍然是制约通信业进一步发展的关键，尤其是没有“播放”和“播控”的权力。而在制作内容上，电信业其实也是门外汉。对于电信业而言，最贴切的一句话就是“强化全IP化网络改造，完善全业务运营能力，整合个人、家庭、企业和垂直领域的业务提供能力。”但是这些都不足以阻挡中国三网融合的必然趋势，现在看来，市场化机制的形成并非一日之功，国家意志层面的统一监管需要首先成行。	沈加军,舒华英	正向	"The internal integration of the telecommunications and radio and television system accelerated the internal integration of the telecommunications and radio and television system to unify supervision or became the basis of the three network integration system. □ Shen Jiajun, a reporter of this newspaper, On February 6, China Telecom's ""Magic Screen mTouch - the fourth screen of family information"" was launched in Xuhui Store, Shanghai Guomei. ""Magic Screen mTouch"" adopts an 8-inch display screen, which combines the advantages of three screens of mobile phones, televisions and computers. It was also last week that China Cable Television Network Co., Ltd. revealed that the provincial integration of cable television networks had been completely completed in 13 provinces, and 10 provinces were promoting this work. Looking at the integration speed of the two aspects separately, it is not big, but the whole process of three network integration in China can only be described as slow. The problem is still the original problem. Shu Huaying, an industry expert, broke the deadlock. The first thing to achieve the integration of the three networks is to discuss the unified supervision problem. The unified supervision institution is the institutional basis of the three network integration. From the experience of the past three network integration, it can be seen that the establishment of the integrated regulatory institution and the unified supervision of the network are the basis for the breakthrough of the three network integration, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Japan and other typical countries. In 2003, the United Kingdom set up the integrated regulatory body OFCOM? British Communications Authority , which completely broke down all kinds of barriers that existed in the original information field, further integrating technology and business. The US regulatory authority FCC? Federal Communications Committee  is originally an integrated regulatory body, including public telecommunications, dedicated telecommunications, radio and television, etc. Japan has set up the Information and Communication Policy Bureau and the Comprehensive Communication Infrastructure Bureau under the Ministry of Land, Labor and Transport to supervise telecommunications and broadcasting industries at the same time. However, in China, it has been difficult to make a breakthrough due to the obstacles of interests and policies. Professor Shu Huaying said that since radio and television and telecommunications are managed by two different departments, the coordination of departmental interests in the integration of the three networks is still a big problem. The direct consequence of the unsolved problem of the strict barriers between radio and television and telecommunications is that the decades long debate on the integration of the three networks will be indefinitely stranded. Therefore, in order to truly realize the integration of the three networks, the information service industry, communication, broadcasting and the emerging media through the network need higher level regulatory authorities to exercise regulatory powers. The National Information Supervision Committee should be established to carry out simple supervision and achieve the separation of government and enterprises through this supervision platform. Mutual access to achieve market operation is the prerequisite. In terms of the practice of three network integration, most countries currently allow mutual access directly. The British legislation clearly stipulates that the traditional radio and television and telecommunications are allowed to enter each other, and at the same time, the telecommunications industry adopts a competitive open regulatory approach, and the access to the radio and television industry is relatively strict. German and Indian telecom enterprises have no legal obstacles in providing integrated services. The development of three network integration should give full play to the role of market mechanism, which is the prerequisite for promoting the integration of three networks. From the perspective of domestic reality, the integration of three networks has indeed changed the external relationship of isolation between radio and television and telecommunications, but the independent internal characteristics of both sides still exist. However, the trend of three network integration is irreversible, especially in the context of the current financial crisis, the demand for the integration of three networks is more urgent. Although radio and television have been promoting reform, there are also events that do not conform to the law of the market economy, such as ""being both athletes and referees"", which can be seen from the fact that Huangshi Radio and Television stopped IPTV and Putian Radio and Television promoted digital television. The radio and television industry should accelerate the pace of market-oriented reform. It is feasible for the radio and television industry itself to achieve ""separation of production and broadcasting"", that is, separation of content and transmission, and the integration of three networks will come naturally. The current global economic recovery is mainly due to the short-term effect of the economic stimulus package of various countries. A series of domestic policy measures of the country are related to stimulating domestic demand and creating new economic growth points. Issuing 3G licenses and accelerating the integration of three networks are all chess moves in this direction, which exceed the decision of group interests. Standing on this position, it is not difficult to understand the urgent integration timetable set by the country. The integration of three networks is extremely difficult for radio and television networks. At present, the radio and television networks are independent at four levels (provincial, urban, county and city) in China. The unification of the networks must first be carried out through institutional reform, separated from the administrative department and the establishment of the enterprise management model. That is,脱离the radio and television bureau to establish an independent network group, which constitutes the ""fourth network operator"" and participates in the network industry competition. For the telecommunications industry, the current content bottleneck is still the key to further development of the telecommunications industry, especially the power of ""broadcasting"" and ""broadcast control"". In terms of content production, the telecommunications industry is actually a layman. The most appropriate thing for the telecommunications industry is to ""strengthen the full IP network transformation, improve the full business operation capability, and integrate the business provision capability of individuals, families, enterprises and vertical fields."". But these are not enough to stop the inevitable trend of China's three network integration. Now, it seems that the formation of the market mechanism is not an overnight achievement, and the unified supervision at the level of national will needs to be the first to go."
谷歌就无人驾驶汽车项目在内华达州展开游说新浪科技讯北京时间5月12日上午消息，谷歌正在悄悄展开游说活动，推动内华达成为全美首个允许无人驾驶汽车上路的州。立法游说通过这些立法提案，谷歌希望内华达州能够允许驾驶者通过发送短信的方式控制汽车，而不必因此遭到处罚。此前不到一年，谷歌刚刚承认，正在开发一种能够在没有人工干预的情况下安全行驶的汽车。谷歌去年回应记者采访时表示，已经在加州的公路上对无人驾驶的混合动力汽车进行了测试，测试总里程达到14万英里(约合22.5万公里)。其中有超过1000英里的路程全部由机器人自动驾驶。还有一名谷歌工程师在上下班的50英里路程上测试过部分汽车的无人驾驶功能。谷歌当时并未透露该项目的商用计划。但该公司周二证实，正在对内华达州进行立法游说。不过，谷歌高管拒绝透露为何选择内华达州作为目的地。谷歌发言人杰伊·南卡罗(JayNancarrow)表示，该项目仍然处于测试阶段。谷歌还聘请了游说专家大卫·古德沃特(DavidGoldwater)帮助其推动两项议案，并有望在6月末的内华达州议会立法会议上投票表决。其中一项是允许进行无人驾驶汽车的测试，另外一项则是允许驾驶员发送短信控制电动车。古德沃特4月7日表示，无人驾驶技术比人工驾驶更为安全，而且油耗更低，甚至能够促进经济发展。尽管汽车行业正在加快普及人工智能技术，但完全依靠自动化系统驾驶汽车仍然引发了对安全性和事故责任的质疑。政策制定者和监管者警告称，当前的技术发展非常迅速，有可能会超出现有的法律规定范围。他们认为，如果无人驾驶汽车成为现实，就必须要尽快进行立法。投入商用政策分析师认为，内华达州是首个考虑推广商用无人驾驶汽车的州。这种汽车可以自动泊车、自动驾驶，甚至可以充当自动出租车，为拉斯维加斯的赌场服务。“从某种意义上讲，这是一个很好的范本和模式。它承认需要为测试这种汽车创造一个流程，并在内华达开辟一个区域以供测试。”斯坦福法学院教授瑞恩·卡罗(RyanCalo)说。谷歌的6辆无人驾驶汽车都采用丰田普锐斯和奥迪TT两种车型，由于车顶配备雷达探测器，因此很容易识别。这类汽车还配有多种雷达和摄像头传感器，以及大量的电脑设备。在测试项目中，每辆车都由一名驾驶员负责，另外还有一名谷歌员工负责在客座上监测设备。由于有驾驶员参与，使得谷歌成功规避了法律风险。该项目由人工智能专家塞巴斯蒂安·特伦(SebastianThrun)负责，他在2005年担任斯坦福大学教授时，就曾经领导一组学生和工程师在美国国防部高级研究计划署(DARPA)举行的无人驾驶汽车大赛中获胜。自那以后，特伦便将更多精力放在谷歌的项目上，甚至放弃了在斯坦福大学的终身教授身份，并且聘请了众多专家帮助他完成这个项目。特伦曾多次在公共场合表示，无人驾驶汽车将提升能源效率，同时减少交通事故。他还曾呼吁建立复杂的拼车系统，从而将美国的汽车保有量减少一半。谷歌雄心勃勃的无人驾驶汽车计划表明，硅谷地区正在兴起一个全新的汽车产业。梅赛德斯、大众和其他汽车厂商都已经在该地区建立了实验室。IBM也推出了电池研发项目。在美国电动车制造商Tesla的推动下，原先由通用汽车和丰田合资成立的Nummi汽车工厂也重新开张。(书聿)	塞巴斯蒂安·特伦,卡罗Calo,瑞恩·卡罗,Calo,杰伊·南卡罗,瑞安Calo,特伦,瑞安卡罗,瑞恩卡洛,David,大卫·古德沃特,书聿,瑞恩,斯坦福,DavidGoldwater,瑞恩Calo,瑞安,卡洛,古德沃特	正向	"Google is lobbying in Nevada for the unmanned vehicle project Sina Technology News on the morning of May 12, Beijing time. Google is quietly lobbying to promote Nevada as the first state in the United States to allow unmanned vehicles on the road. Legislative lobbying Through these legislative proposals, Google hopes that Nevada can allow drivers to control cars by sending text messages without being penalized. Less than a year ago, Google just admitted that it was developing a car that could drive safely without human intervention. Google, in response to a journalist's interview last year, said that it had tested an unmanned hybrid car on the road in California, with a total mileage of 140000 miles (about 225000 kilometers). The journey was entirely autonomous by the robot. Another Google engineer tested the unmanned driving function of some cars on a 50 mile journey to and from work. Google did not disclose the commercial plan of this project at that time. But the company confirmed on Tuesday that it was lobbying in Nevada. However, Google executives refused to disclose why Nevada was chosen as the destination. Jay Nancarrow, a spokesman for Google, said that the project was still in the testing stage. Google also hired lobbying experts David Goldwater to help promote two bills, which are expected to be voted at the legislative meeting of the Nevada Legislature at the end of June. One is to allow the test of unmanned vehicles, and the other is to allow drivers to send text messages to control electric vehicles. Goldwater said on April 7 that driverless technology is safer than manned driving, with lower fuel consumption and even can promote economic development. Although the automotive industry is accelerating the popularization of artificial intelligence technology, the complete reliance on the automated system to drive vehicles has still triggered doubts about safety and accident liability. Policymakers and regulators have warned that the current technological development is very rapid and may exceed the scope of existing legal provisions. They believe that if driverless cars become a reality, legislation must be carried out as soon as possible. Policy analysts believe that Nevada is the first state to consider promoting commercial driverless vehicles. This kind of car can park, drive and even serve as an automatic taxi for the casino in Las Vegas. ""In a sense, this is a good model and model. It recognizes the need to create a process for testing such vehicles and opens up an area in Nevada for testing."" Ryan Calo, a professor at Stanford Law School, said. Google's six driverless cars are based on Toyota Prius and Audi TT. They are easy to identify because they are equipped with radar detectors on the roof. This kind of car is also equipped with various radar and camera sensors, as well as a large number of computer devices. In the test project, each vehicle is in charge of a driver, and another Google employee is responsible for monitoring the equipment in the passenger seat. Because there are drivers involved, Google has successfully avoided legal risks. The project is in charge of artificial intelligence expert Sebastian Thrun. When he served as a professor at Stanford University in 2005, he once led a group of students and engineers to win the driverless car competition held by the US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Since then, Thrun has focused more on Google's project, even giving up his tenure as a professor at Stanford University, and hired many experts to help him complete the project. Thrun has repeatedly said in public that driverless cars will improve energy efficiency and reduce traffic accidents. He also called for the establishment of a complex ride sharing system to reduce the number of cars in the United States by half. Google's ambitious driverless car program shows that a new automobile industry is emerging in the Silicon Valley area. Mercedes, Volkswagen and other car manufacturers have set up laboratories in the region. IBM has also launched a battery development project. Under the promotion of Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer in the United States, the Nummi car factory, which was originally a joint venture of General Motors and Toyota, has also reopened.

中国境内银行换汇最划算轻易别找导游换外币春节将至，很多市民踊跃报名团体境外游。如何兑换外币、兑换多少外币，成为多数境外游“菜鸟”的疑问。记者了解到，此中猫腻多多，游客要想省钱，最好提前在中国内地兑换好，交易费用至少可省一成。文/记者井楠记者了解到，报团出国游，兑换外汇一般有三种途径，一是在中国境内找银行兑换，二是在飞机场银行兑换，三是出国以后找当地导游兑换。站在游客的角度来说，三个方法中，在中国境内兑换最划算，飞机场兑换则最不划算。比如广州市民青睐的泰国游。人民币与泰铢目前的汇率中间价是4.84，那么，在中国内地的银行办理，包括千分之三到千分之六的交易费用，市民的买入价格一般在4.81到4.83之间，100元人民币，可以换到至少481元的泰铢。而各国的飞机场银行运作成本高昂，外汇买入与卖出价格一般相差15%到30%，也就是说，如果市民到飞机场兑换100元人民币，一般只能换到410~420元人民币。至于当地导游，不赚外国人的钱是绝对不可能的。一般来说，100元人民币也只能换到大约450元的泰铢。据记者了解，各地的华人导游虽然有区别，但赚10%的外汇差价，是全球业内不成文的潜规则；该差价也要与中国内地的领队分享。最好提前1天预约银行网点除非时间确实紧急，建议游客最好先在内地的银行兑换好外汇。从广州目前的情况来看，去中国银行兑换外币仍是最为便捷、费用较合理的途径，交易费用按日调整，一般为千分之三到千分之五。工商银行、招商银行、外资银行也开办类似业务，有的费用略高，有的营业网点有限，需要等待较长时间。每家银行网点预留的外汇有限，顾客最好提前1天预约，打银行服务热线的人工服务，就近挑选营业网点，留下联系电话后，等待银行的通知。一旦接到通知，就携带人民币与身份证，去柜台办理。当然，多数的银行网点都有比较充足的港币、美元与欧元，有的时候不用预约，也可当场办理。参照报团费1比1准备额外外汇出国旅游该准备多少额外的外汇？民生银行理财专家简岑认为，对于多数中国内地游客来说，参照报团费用，1比1准备出国的额外花费比较合适。比如在广州报名日本的本州6日游，每人报团的费用一般在7899元人民币。每个人交完团费之后，最好还要准备折合约8000元人民币的日元。这是因为，除开报团费，出国的花费一般分为三部分。首先是自费项目。一般旅行团指定自费项目的最大预算相当于旅游团费的1/3到1/2比例，游客交了8000元去旅游，如果想所有项目都玩，就需至少再准备2400元。再者，矿泉水、小食品等即时消费也是出国花费的主要组成部分，一般按照每人每天100元的标准。去欧洲玩10天，就至少需要再追加1000元，去日本玩6天，就还需要600元。最后，游客出国都要购物，去的国家不同，区别较大，但一般准备相当于团费1/3到1/2的费用，总是能应付过来的。三个项目加总起来，总花费基本相当于团费总额，构成了1比1的比例。	简岑,井楠	正向	"When changing foreign exchange in banks in China, it is most cost-effective to find a tour guide to change foreign currency. The Spring Festival is coming, and many citizens are actively applying for group tours abroad. How to exchange foreign currency and how much foreign currency to exchange is a question for most overseas tourists who are ""rookies"". The reporter learned that there are many tricks in this process. If tourists want to save money, it is best to exchange them in advance in the mainland of China, and the transaction fees can be saved at least 10%. / reporter Jing Nan reported that there are generally three ways to exchange foreign exchange when you join a group to travel abroad. One is to find a bank in China to exchange it, the other is to exchange it at the airport bank, and the third is to find a local guide to exchange it after going abroad. From the perspective of tourists, the most cost-effective way is to exchange in China, while the most cost-effective way is to exchange at the airport. For example, Thai tourists favored by Guangzhou residents. The current exchange rate of RMB to Thai Baht is 4.84, so in the inland banks of China, including the transaction fees of 3 to 6 per thousand, the purchase price of the public is generally between 4.81 and 4.83. 100 yuan can be exchanged for at least 481 Thai baht. However, the airports in various countries have high operating costs, and the prices of foreign exchange purchase and sale generally differ by 15% to 30%. That is to say, if citizens go to the airport to exchange 100 yuan, they can generally only get 410~420 yuan. As for the local guide, it is absolutely impossible not to make money from foreigners. Generally speaking, 100 yuan can only be exchanged for about 450 Thai baht. According to the reporter's understanding, although Chinese guides in various places are different, it is an unwritten rule in the global industry to make a 10% foreign exchange spread; The spread should also be shared with the leader in the mainland of China. Unless time is really urgent, it is recommended that tourists had better exchange foreign exchange at the inland bank in advance. At present, from the perspective of Guangzhou, going to the Bank of China to exchange foreign currency is still the most convenient and cost-effective way. The transaction fees are adjusted on a daily basis, generally ranging from 3 to 5 per thousand. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Merchants Bank and foreign banks also carry out similar businesses, some of which have slightly higher costs, and some have limited business outlets, which require a long wait. Each bank's branch has limited foreign exchange reserved, so it is best for customers to make an appointment one day in advance. Call the bank's service hotline for manual service, choose a business outlet nearby, leave a contact telephone number, and wait for the bank's notice. Once you receive the notification, take the RMB and ID card with you to go to the counter. Of course, most bank outlets have sufficient Hong Kong dollars, US dollars and euros. Sometimes, there is no need to make an appointment, and you can also handle it on the spot. Refer to the group fee of 1 to 1 to prepare additional foreign exchange for foreign travel. How much additional foreign exchange should be prepared for foreign travel? Jian Cen, a financial expert of Minsheng Bank, believes that for most Chinese mainland tourists, it is appropriate to prepare additional expenses for going abroad in a ratio of 1 to 1 in accordance with the group fee. For example, the group fee for each person to sign up for a six day tour of Honzhou, Japan in Guangzhou is generally 7899 yuan. After each person pays the group fee, it is better to prepare Japanese yen worth 8000 yuan. This is because the expenses for going abroad are generally divided into three parts, excluding the group fee. The first is the self funded project. The maximum budget of the self financed project specified by the general tour group is equivalent to 1/3 to 1/2 of the tour group fee. If the tourist pays 8000 yuan to travel, he/she needs to prepare at least 2400 yuan if he/she wants to play all the projects. Secondly, mineral water, snacks and other immediate consumption are also the main components of foreign spending, generally in accordance with the standard of 100 yuan per person per day. If you play in Europe for 10 days, you need to add another 1000 yuan, and if you play in Japan for 6 days, you still need 600 yuan. Finally, tourists have to go shopping when they go abroad. The cost varies greatly depending on the country they go to, but generally, they can prepare 1/3 to 1/2 of the group fee, which is always enough. The total cost of the three projects is basically equivalent to the total group fee, forming a ratio of 1 to 1."
英国东南部肯特郡4万只死蟹被冲上海岸(组图)环球时报特约记者宋华报道据英国《每日邮报》1月5日报道，世界多地最近多次发生大量动物神秘死亡事件，首先是数千只燕八哥在美国阿肯色州坠亡，接下来又有数千条死鱼被冲上海岸。现在，又发现4万多只死梭子蟹(又称魔鬼蟹)被冲上英国东南部肯特郡海岸。报道称，数万死蟹沿英国肯特郡的海岸线被冲上岸，环境专家认为，英国寒冷的天气可能是导致梭子蟹死亡的原因。梭子蟹据信是英国120年来最寒冷的12月份的受害者，寒冷的天气使海水温度比平常值低了不少。英国塞恩特海岸看守托尼•斯亚克斯称：“我们怀疑气候变化和更温暖的天气诱使蟹前往海岸线，它们进入这些海域可能是为了寻找海藻。我们认为，温度突然下降使蟹因温度过低而死亡。”与此同时，5日在瑞典斯德哥尔摩的一条街道上发现了50只寒鸦的尸体。调查这一事件的兽医对美联社称，目前还不清楚这些鸟的死亡原因，但4日晚上事发地曾燃放过焰火。除了焰火之外，兽医称，寒冷的天气和难以找到食物也可能是导致鸟死亡的原因。在此之前，美国发生了数起大量动物死亡的事件。450只鸟4日在路易斯安那州坠亡，原因不详。在新年前夕，3000多只红翼燕八哥从阿肯色州的空中坠亡。美国官员承认他们可能无法确认鸟死亡的原因。另外，在距事发地以西数百英里的野生专家仍在努力寻找10万条死鱼被冲上河岸的原因。	宋华,托尼•斯亚克斯	负向	"40000 dead crabs were washed up on the coast of Kent in southeastern England (photo) Song Hua, a special reporter of the Global Times, reported on January 5 According to the Daily Mail, a large number of animals have recently died mysteriously in many parts of the world. First, thousands of swallows fell to death in Arkansas, USA, and then thousands of dead fish were washed up on the shore. Now, another 40000 dead horseshoe crabs (also known as devil crabs) have been washed up on the coast of Kent in southeastern England. The report said that tens of thousands of dead crabs were washed up along the coast of Kent, England, and environmental experts believe that the cold weather in England may be the reason for the death of horseshoe crabs. It is believed that the horseshoe crab is the victim of the coldest December in 120 years in the UK, and the cold weather makes the sea water temperature much lower than the normal value. Tony Siaks, a coast guard in Seine, England, said: ""We suspect that climate change and warmer weather have led crabs to the coast, and they may enter these waters to look for seaweed. We believe that the sudden drop in temperature leads to the death of crabs due to low temperature."" At the same time, the bodies of 50 blackbirds were found on a street in Stockholm, Sweden, on the 5th. The veterinarian who investigated this incident told the Associated Press that it was not clear what caused the death of these birds, but fireworks were set off in the area on the evening of the 4th. In addition to fireworks, veterinarians said that cold weather and lack of food may also be the causes of bird deaths. Prior to this, a number of animal deaths occurred in the United States. 450 birds fell to their deaths in Louisiana on the 4th for unknown reasons. On New Year's Eve, more than 3000 red winged blackbirds fell from the sky in Arkansas. American officials admitted that they may not be able to confirm the cause of death of birds. In addition, hundreds of miles west of the site, wild experts are still trying to find out the reason why 100000 dead fish were washed up on the river bank."
易建联2分11板洛佩斯21分篮网负勇士已3遭10连败新浪体育讯　北京时间1月23日，篮网在客场以79-111不敌勇士。您对易建联全场拿下2分、11个篮板、2次封盖，投中个人NBA职业生涯第500球，抓下第800个篮板，罚球命中数为300的表现有何评价？>>>>篮网(3-39)十连败，这已经是他们本赛季第三次连输10场(或以上)，最近21场比赛，篮网只赢1场。布鲁克-洛佩斯得到21分6个篮板，库特尼-李17分6个篮板。易建联6投1中，仅得2分，不过抢下11个篮板，抢断、封盖各2次。此外，本场比赛过后，易建联的个人NBA职业生涯进球数达到500，篮板达到800，罚球命中数为300，成为继姚明之后第二位达到这一系列里程碑的中国球员。勇士(13-28)轻松地关。斯蒂芬-库里打满48分钟，拿下32分7次助攻，科里-马盖蒂29分，安东尼-托利弗12分10个篮板。蒙塔-埃利斯仅上阵24分钟，得到4分5次助攻。在过去的三场比赛里，勇士能上场的只有8名球员，其中3人来自NBDL。因此，蒙塔-埃利斯打满全部的三场比赛，未能休息一分钟。此前，只有阿伦-艾弗森在1997年曾连续打满3场，23年来还从没人能连续4场打满。埃利斯本有机会冲击这一纪录，不过由于右脚踝扭伤，最终未能如愿。首节两队还有得一拼，篮网在本节最后3分34秒，只投中一球，勇士以26-21领先结束本节。易建联在本节出手投篮一次，未能命中，未能得分。埃利斯也不在状态，本节4投全失，未能得分。易建联第二节仍投篮一次，依然未能得分。勇士在本节还有7分14秒时，以42-23取得19分的优势。此后，洛佩斯还以一球，库特尼-李连续三分命中，篮网打出13-4的攻击波，将比分追成36-44。在近6分钟里，勇士只投中一球，尽管如此，他们仍保持优势，上半场以50-44领先。第三节还有10分17秒时，易建联终于在三分线内一步的位置投中一球，这是他全场首次得分。不过，勇士连得4分，将优势扩大到两位数。此后，勇士继续猛烈进攻，以一波10-0结束本节，一举以88-65取得23分的优势。篮网在本节最后3分39秒，竟然一分未得。从第四节还有8分41秒时起，勇士在3分35秒内未能投中一球，尽管如此，篮网未能将差距缩小到20分以内。在比赛还有5分06秒时，马盖蒂三分命中，勇士发动9-0的攻击，以104-73取得31分的优势。胜负早无悬念，勇士苦于没有足够的替补球员，只得让库里等人继续留在场上。[直播实录][技术统计](吴哥)	洛佩斯,托利弗,安东尼-托利弗,蒙塔-埃利斯,姚明,埃利斯,马盖蒂,库里,易建联,科里-马盖蒂,斯蒂芬-库里,库特尼-李,阿伦-艾弗森,布鲁克-洛佩斯,吴哥,李	负向	Yi Jianlian scored 2 points and 11 rebounds, while Lopez scored 21 points and the Nets lost to the Warriors for the third time in a row. Sina Sports News On January 23, Beijing time, the Nets lost to the Warriors 79-111 away from home. What do you think of Yi Jianlian's performance of scoring 2 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks, hitting his 500th ball in his personal NBA career, grabbing his 800th rebound and making 300 free throws?>>>>The Nets (3-39) lost ten consecutive games, which was the third time this season that they had lost 10 consecutive games (or more). In the recent 21 games, the Nets only won one game. Brook Lopez scored 21 points and 6 rebounds, and Courtney Lee scored 17 points and 6 rebounds. Yi Jianlian made only 2 points in 6 shots, but he grabbed 11 rebounds and made 2 steals and 2 blocks. In addition, after this game, Yi Jianlian's personal NBA career goals reached 500, rebounds reached 800, and free throws reached 300, becoming the second Chinese player to reach this series of milestones after Yao Ming. The Warriors (13-28) were closed easily. Stephen Curry played for 48 minutes and scored 32 points and 7 assists. Corey Magetti scored 29 points and Anthony Tolliver scored 12 points and 10 rebounds. Monta Ellis only played for 24 minutes and scored 4 points and 5 assists. In the past three games, the Warriors had only eight players who could play, three of whom came from NBDL. As a result, Monta Ellis played all three games and did not have a minute's rest. Previously, only Allen Iverson had played three consecutive full games in 1997, and no one had played four consecutive full games for 23 years. Ellis had a chance to challenge this record, but he was not able to do so due to his right ankle sprain. Both teams still have a chance to compete in the first quarter. In the last 3 minutes and 34 seconds of this section, the Nets only hit one ball, and the Warriors ended this section with a 26-21 lead. Yi Jianlian shot once in this section but did not make a hit or score. Ellis was also out of shape, missing four shots in this quarter and failing to score. Yi Jianlian still shot in the second quarter, but he still didn't score. The Warriors had a 19 point lead at 42-23 with 7:14 left in this section. After that, Lopez scored another goal, Courtney Lee made three consecutive hits, and the Nets made a 13-4 attack to even the score at 36-44. In nearly 6 minutes, the Warriors only hit one ball, but they still maintained their advantage and led 50-44 at the end of the first half. With 10:17 seconds left in the third quarter, Yi Jianlian finally made a shot at the position of one step inside the three-point line, which was his first score in the game. However, the Warriors scored four consecutive points to expand their advantage to double figures. After that, the Warriors continued to attack fiercely, ending this section with a 10-0 wave, taking a 23 point lead of 88-65. The Nets actually scored no points in the last 3 minutes and 39 seconds of this section. With 8:41 left in the fourth quarter, the Warriors failed to make a shot in 3 minutes and 35 seconds, but the Nets failed to reduce the gap to less than 20 points. With 5:06 left in the game, Magetti made a three-point shot, and the Warriors launched a 9-0 attack to take a 31 point lead of 104-73. There was no suspense about the victory or defeat. The Warriors were short of substitutes, so they had to let Curry and others continue to stay on the court. [Live recording] [Technical statistics] (Angkor)

周三亚马逊将推出平板电脑KindleFire传说中的亚马逊平板电脑终于要来了，TechCrunch的MGSiegler确认了这个消息。在美国时间周三，亚马逊将推出平板电脑：KindleFire，这个名字是为了和它的电子阅读设备Kindle区分开，届时亚马逊CEO杰夫贝索斯将登台演讲，但是这个设备真正开卖还要等到11月的第二个星期。KindleFire将有7英寸的背光显示器，很像黑莓的PlayBook。但经过MG试用，他认为亚马逊的设备要比PlayBook更好，因为他们有更好的软件以及更好的内容。亚马逊有自己定制的Android操作系统(和Android一点也不像)和自己的应用商店，但是它的商店不会提供所有官方Android市场里的应用。亚马逊已经邀请那些大的应用开发商去参加他们的发布会。亚马逊还与福布斯合作电影和电视等流媒体内容，这也将成为KindleFire非常核心的一部分，同时他们与一些内容发布商合作由他们来提供杂志内容。毫无疑问亚马逊的MP3服务和电子书服务会重度集成到设备中。只是目前还不确定KindleFire采用的是什么芯片，据猜测可能是双核的OMAP芯片，主频1.2GHz。下面是根据描述MG的同学画出来的图片，也就是说，KindleFire的样子跟这张图片差得不远：	杰夫贝索斯,MGSiegler	正向	On Wednesday, Amazon will launch the tablet computer KindleFire. The legendary Amazon tablet computer is finally coming. MGSiegler of TechCrunch confirmed the news. On Wednesday (U.S. time), Amazon will launch the tablet computer: KindleFire. The name is to distinguish it from its e-reading device Kindle. At that time, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, will take the stage to give a speech. However, it will not be until the second week of November that the device will be available for sale. KindleFire will have a 7-inch backlit display, very similar to BlackBerry's PlayBook. But after MG's trial, he thought Amazon's device was better than PlayBook because they had better software and better content. Amazon has its own customized Android operating system (nothing like Android) and its own app store, but its store will not provide all the applications in the official Android market. Amazon has invited major application developers to attend their press conference. Amazon has also cooperated with Forbes to stream media content such as movies and television, which will also be a very core part of KindleFire, and they cooperate with some content publishers to provide magazine content. There is no doubt that Amazon's MP3 service and e-book service will be heavily integrated into the device. Just not sure what chip KindleFire uses. It is speculated that it may be a dual-core OMAP chip with the main frequency of 1.2GHz. The following picture drawn by MG's classmates according to the description is that KindleFire is not far from this picture:

揍记者主帅一夜成民族英雄3年30球大将吓破蓝军胆记者王庆报报道得知新西兰和巴拉圭战平，斯洛伐克人疯狂庆祝，首次以独立国家身份参加世界杯就进了淘汰赛，他们是真正的意外。主帅魏斯说得没错：“我个人十分崇拜里皮。可他们被迫赢球，我们不是，谁脑子里更放松，谁能拿下这场比赛。”从过程看，斯洛伐克更放松。意大利北方联盟代表、国家联邦改革委员翁贝托·博西赛前说意大利会收买斯洛伐克达到出线目的、下赛季斯洛伐克人大批出现在意甲赛场，魏斯一脸惊讶：“什么意思？是玩笑吗？这个人我不知道，更不清楚他想干什么。我只认识意大利总理，还是从电视上看的。”魏斯这位前捷克斯洛伐克国脚成了民族英雄，没人会记得他的粗暴，第二场输巴拉圭赛后，他和本国记者怒目相向还动了手，他批评记者：“真得感谢你们，你们比国外记者都好。写了那么多坏话，现在还有脸来采访我儿子？真是狗屎，我要朝你的脸给上一拳”，然后和一名叫斯帕切克的记者扭做一团。所有情况被国际足联两位官员记录在案，很可能对魏斯给予处罚。魏斯口气强硬：“我遗憾，但决不认错，那些人传递了悲观消极的信号让我们不舒服，足球本身应该是快乐的。”拿到世界杯16强名额，魏斯就算打人，也不会有人在意了。维泰克一战成名，对卫冕冠军梅开二度，加上对新西兰的入球，3球成为头号射手，抢了头号球星哈姆西克风头。意大利太注意哈姆西克了，他在意大利的3个赛季107场联赛进了30球，刚结束的意甲赛季他破门12次，和埃托奥、帕托相等，是进球最多的中场球员。更可怕在，他对意大利许多国脚都有噩梦记录，哈姆西克自认最漂亮进球在2008年5月倒数第二轮对米兰，米兰于客场失掉冠军杯席位的关键战，哈姆西克中场从加图索脚下断球长驱直入劲射破门。哈姆西克最喜欢的靶子是尤文，4个进球，其中3个在刚结束的赛季都决定了比赛结果，3球都在卡纳瓦罗、基耶利尼中卫组合面前完成。马尔凯蒂也无法幸免，2008年11月哈姆西克进了马尔凯蒂一球，不过去年12月那不勒斯和卡利亚里3比3大战，马尔凯蒂异常神勇化解哈姆西克所有射门。真所谓不是冤家不聚头。赢球后哈姆西克非常激动，“我的位置无所谓，每个教练都有自己想法。对巴拉圭我更靠前一些，这次靠后一些，这不是靠左10米还是靠右10米的问题，在于全队态度。意大利就像一座高山挡在所有人面前，如今我们翻越了高山。”那不勒斯球员参加世界杯的不少，意大利有4个，乌拉圭还有个加尔加诺，不过打上主力的只有哈姆西克一个。	翁贝托·博西赛,马尔凯蒂,维泰克,魏斯,王庆,加图索,斯帕切克,帕托,卡纳瓦罗,哈姆西克,埃托奥	正向	"The coach who beat the reporter became a national hero overnight. The 30 ball generals in three years broke the blue army's courage. The reporter Wang Qing reported that New Zealand and Paraguay drew. The Slovaks celebrated crazily. They were real accidents when they participated in the World Cup for the first time as an independent country and entered the elimination round. The coach Wei said correctly: ""I personally admire Lippi very much. But they were forced to win, we were not. Who is more relaxed in our minds and who can win this game."" From the process, Slovakia is more relaxed. Umberto Bossi, a representative of the Italian Northern League and a member of the National Federation Reform Commission, said before the game that Italy would buy Slovakia to achieve the goal of qualifying for the next season, and a large number of Slovakians would appear in the Serie A stadium. Wei was surprised: ""What do you mean? Is it a joke? I don't know this person, and I don't know what he wants to do. I only know the Italian Prime Minister, but I saw him on TV."" Wei, a former Czechoslovakian international football player, became a national hero. No one would remember his rudeness. After the second game, he lost to Paraguay, and he had a fight with the local reporters. He criticized the reporter: ""Thank you very much. You are better than the foreign journalists. You have written so many bad words. Now you have the courage to interview my son? It's really shit. I want to give you a punch in the face"", and then twist with a reporter named Spacetic. All the situations were recorded by two officials of FIFA and it is likely that Wei would be punished. Wei's tone was tough: ""I am sorry, but I will never admit my mistake. Those people have passed on pessimistic and negative signals, which made us uncomfortable. Football itself should be happy."" Wei won the 16th place in the World Cup, even if he fought, no one would care. Vittek became famous in the battle. He scored twice against the defending champion. With the goal against New Zealand, the three goals became the top scorer,抢starring the top star Hamseik. Italy paid too much attention to Hamseik. He scored 30 goals in 107 league games in his three seasons in Italy. He has just ended the Serie A season, scoring 12 goals equal to Eto and Pato, the most goals in the midfielder. More frightening is that he has nightmare records for many Italian international players. Hamseik believes that the most beautiful goal was in the penultimate round against Milan on May 2008. Milan lost the key battle of the Champions Cup seat away from home. Hamseik broke the ball from Gatuso's feet in the midfield and shot to score a goal. Hamseik's favorite target is Juventus, with 4 goals, and three of them in the season ended just ended, which have decided the game results. All three goals have been completed in front of the central defender combination of Cannavaro and Chiellini. Marchetti could not escape either. In November 2008, Hamseik scored a goal from Marchetti, but in the 3-3 battle between Naples and Cagliari last December, Marchetti was abnormally brave to resolve all shots from Hamseik. It's really not a quarrel. After winning the game, Hamseik was very excited. ""I don't care about my position. Each coach has his own ideas. I was more forward against Paraguay and this time I was more backward. It's not a problem of 10 meters to the left or 10 meters to the right, but the attitude of the whole team. Italy is like a high mountain in front of everyone, and now we have crossed the high mountain."" There are many Napoli players who participated in the World Cup. There are 4 in Italy and another Gargano in Uruguay, but only Hamseik has made the main team."

单打王：熟悉西海岸球风所以打得好助理教练很棒新浪体育讯　北京时间3月3日(华盛顿时间2日)奇才对阵勇士的第四节，无疑是属于尼克-杨的，这个神经刀一样的妖人，只要投出手感，无论对面站着谁，一样无解。单节狂得14分，并在最后6.9秒投中关键球，将比赛的胜负拉到最后一秒钟。尽管球队最后输球，但是尼克-杨全场却贡献了31分。赛后的尼克-杨摇摇头，即使说到自己的31分，也丝毫看不出喜悦，“我们输球了，31分也没有太大意义了。”杨在最后一节的疯狂表现，让曾经一度领先奇才20分的勇士一下子感受到了危机感。而对杨进行了夹击，但是任凭面前再多支手，杨也照样能够投进，从第四节11分49秒开始，表演就一直持续到最后的6秒，最后6.9秒，奇才以99比103落后4分，所有的球迷都以为胜利无望，纷纷退场时，杨在三分线外出手，此时，两名队员的手都捂在了杨的脸上，可是皮球仍然应声入网。全场沸腾。而杨也高兴的露出了他孩子般的招牌笑容。可惜，之后，皮球再没有轮转到杨的手里，奇才一直制造犯规战术，而勇士队4罚3中，奇才遗憾告负。赛后，记者都想让杨谈谈第四节的疯狂表现，但是往常嘻嘻哈哈的杨却乐不起来。“进了那个球的时候，我感觉很好，觉得我们还有机会，但是可惜，我们没有抢到一个关键的篮板，输掉了比赛。这真的很可惜。”杨摇摇头。有记者问，为什么今天后半场杨才找到些手感。杨说：“之前我们全队都打的不好，进攻中有些乱，我想要投进去，可是皮球偏偏弹出。而下半场，我感觉自己的手慢慢热了起来，我感觉我们虽然输了很多，但是比赛没有结束，我应该赶紧做点什么。”金州勇士队来自加州，而尼克-杨也是加州人，对阵勇士，妖星感觉到更多的是熟悉和亲切。“他们打的就是西海岸的篮球，我对西海岸的篮球打法很清楚，很熟悉，所以我打这种比赛通常会发挥的不错。而且你知道，我的家人都在那边，我一想到他们在看我的比赛呢，我就觉得很兴奋，我告诉自己，不能放松。只可惜今天球队输掉了比赛。”说起助理教练的指导，尼克-杨甚是肯定，他说：“兰迪一直告诉我们要保持自信，一直鼓励我们，不要以为对方领先那么多我们就一定会输，那只是暂时的，尽管我们没有赢球，但是他是个好教练，告诉我们的信念非常重要。”(华盛顿特派记者沈洋前方报道)	尼克-杨,兰迪,沈洋,杨	正向	"Singles King: Familiar with the West Coast ball style, the assistant coach is great. Sina Sports News On March 3, Beijing time (Washington time on February 2), the fourth quarter of the Wizards against the Warriors was undoubtedly属于Nick Young, a magical man like a nerve knife. Whenever he makes a shot, whoever stands in front of him, he will make a shot. In a single quarter, he scored 14 points and hit a key shot in the last 6.9 seconds, which pulled the game to the last second. Although the team lost in the end, Nick Young contributed 31 points. Nick Young shook his head after the game. Even when he talked about his 31 points, he could not see any joy. ""We lost, and 31 points is not very meaningful."" Yang's crazy performance in the last quarter made the Warriors, who once led the Wizards by 20 points, feel a sense of crisis all at once. And to surround and intercept Yang, but no matter how many hands there are in front of him, Yang can still shoot. From 11 minutes and 49 seconds in the fourth quarter, the performance lasted until the last 6 seconds. In the last 6.9 seconds, the Wizards fell behind by 4 points with 99-103. All fans thought there was no hope of victory, and they all withdrew. When Yang made a shot outside the three point line, at this time, the hands of two players were covering Yang's face, but the ball still fell into the net. The audience boiled. Yang also showed his childlike trademark smile happily. Unfortunately, after that, the ball never rotated to Yang's hand again. The Wizards kept fouling, and the Warriors made 3 out of 4 free throws, and the Wizards lost regretfully. After the game, the journalists all wanted Yang to talk about his crazy performance in the fourth quarter, but Yang, who usually laughed, was not happy. ""When I got that ball, I felt good and thought we still had a chance. But unfortunately, we didn't get a key rebound and lost the game. It's really a pity."" Yang shook his head. A reporter asked why Yang found some hand feeling in the second half today. Yang said: ""Before, our team didn't play well. There was some chaos in the attack. I wanted to shoot, but the ball jumped out. In the second half, I felt my hand getting hot slowly. I think we lost a lot, but the game is not over. I should do something quickly."" The Golden State Warriors come from California, and Nick Young is also from California. When playing against the Warriors, the demon star feels more familiar and kind. ""They play basketball in the West Coast. I know and am familiar with the West Coast basketball, so I usually play well in this game. Besides, you know, my family are there. When I think of them watching my game, I feel very excited. I tell myself that I can't relax. Unfortunately, the team lost the game today."" Speaking of the guidance of the assistant coach, Nick Young is very肯定. He said: ""Randy has been telling us to keep confident, always encouraging us, and not to think that we will lose if the other side is so far ahead. It is just temporary. Although we did not win, he is a good coach, and the belief he told us is very important."" (Shen Yang, a special correspondent in Washington, reported from the front)"
热议：考研成功的第一秘诀是什么信心，是成功的第一秘诀。——[美]爱默生美国作家爱默生说话很精辟，但非常具有哲理。细细品来，给我们无穷的思考和鼓励。对于考研的学生来说，基础差、底子薄的现象广泛存在，有的考生还在职，放下课本多年，要复习考研都不是一件简单的事情。难道就要放弃？不，这样的考生很显然没有自信！细数国内研究生，不是每一个都天生聪明，他们能考上，为什么自己考不上呢？用爱默生的话来说，叫：自信，是考研成功的第一秘诀。信心，self-confidence,只有相信自己能够成功的人，才会有无穷的动力，才会让我们去为成功作准备，而不是去为失败找借口。对于在校学生来说，可以利用的考研复习时间那么多，为什么还要唉声叹气、举步不前？在考研教育网，去年有这样一个学员，任职于天津一家公司，与公司签定了三年工作合同，辞职需支付巨额违约金，所以直到8月底合同到期后才真正走出工厂、辞职考研。给网校打电话之前并不知道远程辅导可以随时随地听，所以8月底才开始准备。第一次考研，他英语基本上算是零基础，政治、数学自大二学完，放下五年了，而且当时也仅是六十几分勉强通过的。打过报名电话之后，报了实验班，希望在班主任的帮助下，在剩下的时间中能顺利考上。班主任问他现在开始复习有没有什么心理的负担，他很坦然地说：“既然都晚了就得想方法赶上，别的想多了也是白想。我辞职了，有时间了，加上知道工作的难处，肯定会比他们肯学，所以我相信我不会落后，会迎头赶上。”这个学员就凭着自己的自信和韧劲，在班主任老师指导的方法下拿下了东北大学自动化的研究生，东北大学自动化，那是全国知名，人家考上了，这种自信和韧劲值得很多人学习。很多人是自己放弃了自己，认为自己考不上，但是却在扼杀自己自信心的同时，粉碎了自己的研究生梦想，悲哉！《老残游记》里说：天地生才有限，不宜妄自菲薄！意思是天生的天才是极少的，大家都差不多，绝不应该自己瞧不起自己！所以当自己怀疑自己能力的时候，大家不妨对自己说一下这句话，给自己增加信心，打消自卑心理，勇敢在考研路上前行吧！更多信息请访问：新浪考研频道考研论坛考研博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。	爱默生	正向	"Hot discussion: what is the first secret of success for postgraduate examination? Confidence is the first secret of success. - [American] Emerson, an American writer, spoke very incisively but very philosophically. When you taste it carefully, it gives us infinite thought and encouragement. For students who are preparing for postgraduate examination, the phenomenon of poor foundation and thin foundation is widespread. Some candidates have been在职for many years after putting down textbooks, and it is not easy for them to review for postgraduate examination. Shall we give up? No, such examinees obviously have no confidence! Counting the domestic graduate students, they are not all born smart. Why can't they pass the exam? As Emerson said: confidence is the first secret of success in postgraduate examination. Confidence, self-confidence, only those who believe that they can succeed will have infinite power, which will let us prepare for success instead of making excuses for failure. For students, there is so much time for postgraduate examination review, why should they sigh and stop? On the postgraduate examination education network, there was such a student last year. He worked in a company in Tianjin and signed a three-year work contract with the company. He had to pay a huge amount of liquidated damages for resignation, so it was not until the end of August that he really left the factory and resigned for postgraduate examination. I didn't know that distance tutoring can be heard anytime and anywhere before calling the online school, so I started to prepare at the end of August. For the first time, he basically had zero English foundation, and he had put down politics and mathematics for five years after finishing them in sophomore year, and at that time, they only passed with a score of more than 60. After making a registration call, he reported to the experimental class, hoping that he could pass the examination smoothly with the help of the head teacher in the remaining time. The head teacher asked him if there was any psychological burden to start reviewing now. He said frankly: ""Since it's late, we have to find a way to catch up. It's a waste of time to think too much. I have resigned and have time. Knowing the difficulty of working, I will definitely be more willing to learn than them, so I believe I will not fall behind, but I will catch up with them."" This student, with his confidence and tenacity, won the postgraduate student of Northeast University's automation under the guidance of his head teacher. Northeast University's automation is well known in China. His confidence and tenacity are worth learning from many people. Many people give up their own, thinking that they can't pass the examination, but they kill their confidence and crush their dreams of postgraduate students. Sad! Laocan's journey says: Heaven and earth have limited talents, and they should not look down on themselves! The meaning is that there are very few natural geniuses, and everyone is almost the same, so they should never look down on themselves! So when you doubt your ability, you can say this sentence to yourself to increase your confidence, eliminate your inferiority complex, and be brave on the road of postgraduate examination!

棒喝：考研中阿Q精神要不得阿Q是鲁迅先生笔下的人物，所谓的阿Q精神也被中国人熙熙攘攘了几十年，开始的时候这是纯粹的悲剧性人物，围绕他的一些论调多是倾向于批判。但是随着时代变迁，世人观念的改变，很多时候阿Q精神竟被美化成所谓的自我安慰或者说中庸之道，真的是这样么？这里不妄加评断，我们只谈考研中，这种阿Q精神绝对要不得。不能有“自尊癖”阿Q的第一个特点就是“自尊癖”。阿Q本是极卑微的人，他没有家，没有固定的职业，只给人家做短工，没有人真的记得他。然而，阿Q却很自尊，“所有未庄的居民，全不在他眼睛里”，甚至赵太爷儿子进了学，他在精神上也不表示尊崇，以为“我的儿子将比他阔得多”。这种无谓的自尊并不能给我们带来以为的精神上的愉悦，也不会对改变现实有任何的意义。就比如我们总能听到有的考研学生这样说，要是我如何如何，也会怎样怎样，或者是“××大学”有什么好的，我还不愿意去呢，等等，这种毫无意义的夸谈。这里告诫同学们，千万不要像阿Q一样不如人不顺心时，不去想怎么样去争取去努力，而是无端的诋毁或者说大话连篇，这样最终一事无成且永远活在嫉妒中的是你自己。不能“欺弱怕强”阿Q的第二个特点是“欺弱怕强”。阿Q最喜欢与人吵嘴打架，但必估量对手，口呐的他便骂，气力小的他便打。可是，当他在路上遇到“假洋鬼子”时，他脱口说了句“秃儿”，不料被听见了，“假洋鬼子”举起了“哭丧棒”，他便赶紧缩起脖子，等着挨揍，连吃了几棍子，一点不敢反抗。现实社会中，这样欺软怕硬的人处处可见，很是可气。同时，我们说，“欺弱怕强”也并不是单单表现在待人上，就比如在考研过程中，很多同学也都存在着“欺弱怕强”的特点，对于自己感兴趣的科目，学起来觉得得心应手的科目，总是能够优先复习，多复习，愿意去复习；对于那些比较难的科目，自己比较薄弱的环节总想去逃避，总期望能够找到捷径，并不能沉下心来认真对待，总是在下定决心好好学习与不断的自我否定与原谅中徘徊。“欺弱怕强”是一种不去尽力甘于自我欺骗的放弃心理，对你的科目复习与考研成功有着严重的不良影响，同学们一定要摒弃掉这个坏习惯。不能“投机取巧”阿Q的第三个特点是“善于投机”。比如对待革命的态度上，阿Q本来是对革命一向深恶痛绝的，但当他看到“未庄的一群鸟男女(在革命到来之际)的慌张的神情”时，便想：“革命也好罢，革这伙妈妈的命，太可恶！太可恨！便是我，也要投降革命党了。”阿Q革命的目的，不过是为了他自己的利益，“我要什么就是什么，我喜欢谁就是谁”。当然，我们这里说的投机取巧更多的是专注于学习层面的，但是道理是一样的，就是投机取巧不好。投机取巧首先从态度上就走入了误区，考研复习来说，太多的同学不能脚踏实地，总是想着不努力不辛苦就能取得好成绩，殊不知，日子就在这样的蹉跎中白白荒废。书山有路勤为径，学海无涯苦作舟，要想成功必须经过不懈的努力，千万不能侥存投机心理。不能“自欺欺人”阿Q的第四个特点是“自欺欺人”，即“精神胜利法”。阿Q与人家打架吃了亏，心里就想：“我总算被儿子打了，现在世界真不像样，儿子居然打起老子来了。”于是他心满意足，俨然得了胜利似的。有很多人推崇这种精神胜利法，但是学习中，这种精神胜利绝对要不得。我们接触到很多同学，复习的时候总是会有这样一些情况，遇到一些比较难的或者说不太会的题，就会安慰自己说，没事儿，这种题型太偏不太容易考；有时候懒惰不想复习，就会对自己说没什么，我就休息几天，不会有什么影响等等，这都是典型的自欺欺人。自欺欺人实质上是对自己的一种放纵不负责任，无论是对学习还是生活都是不好的，希望同学们能够远离这种“自欺”。不做学习的奴隶阿Q的第五个特点是“奴隶性”。这表现在有些同学的身上就是这样的，不能积极主动的去学习，总是感觉被逼迫着被动的去学。大学之前，大家都是在老师家长的监督管控下学习，学是学了，但是没有养成好的自学习惯，一旦脱离了监控，马上开始懈怠想着放松。这种状态可能在进入大学之前还不是很明显，一旦进入大学，脱离了曾经紧张的学习环境，也不再有老师家长的督促，很大一部分同学都迷失在享乐与松懈的状态下。很多人说现在的大学生在学习上“奴性”很强，主要是不会主动学习，不能主动学习，总是被动被迫着去学。可是对于考研来说，这么长期的一个需要艰苦奋斗的过程，是必须要求大家能够积极主动去学习的，因为没有人去提醒你监督你帮助你，一切都靠你自己，所以，不要做学习的“奴隶”，要做主人。正因为着阿Q的这些典型精神，造成了他悲剧性的一生，我们应该从中得到教训，不能做新时代的阿Q，更不能把阿Q精神带到学习生活中。更多信息请访问：新浪考研频道考研论坛考研博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。	赵太爷,阿Q	负向	"Stick to the stick: In the examination for postgraduate students, the so-called ""Ah Q spirit"" is not desirable. Ah Q is a character under the pen of Mr. Lu Xun. The so-called ""Ah Q spirit"" has been bustling for decades by the Chinese people. At the beginning, this was a purely tragic figure, and the discussion around him tended to criticize. However, with the change of times and the change of people's ideas, the Ah Q spirit has often been beautified into the so-called self consolation or the way of moderation. Is it really the case? Here, we will not dare to comment. We will only talk about the fact that this kind of Ah Q spirit is absolutely undesirable in the postgraduate examination. Don't have ""narcissism"" Ah Q's first characteristic is ""narcissism"". Ah Q was very humble. He had no home and no fixed job. He only did short term work for others, and no one really remembered him. However, Ah Q is very self respecting. ""All the residents of Weizhuang are not in his eyes"". Even when Zhao Taiye's son enters the university, he does not show respect in spirit, thinking ""my son will be much richer than him"". This kind of unnecessary self respect can not bring us the pleasure of the spirit, nor will it have any significance to change the reality. For example, we can always hear some postgraduate students say that if I do something, I will also do something, or ""×× University"" is not good. I don't want to go there, and so on. This kind of meaningless bragging. Here, I would like to warn you not to be like Ah Q. When you are not happy with others, don't think about how to strive and work hard, but rather to discredit or talk nonsense. In the end, it is yourself who will never live in jealousy and never achieve anything. Don't ""bully the weak and fear the strong"" The second characteristic of Ah Q is ""bullying the weak and fearing the strong"". Ah Q likes to quarrel and fight with others most, but he must estimate his opponent. He scolds the one who is not talkative, and beats the one who is small. However, when he met a ""fake foreign devil"" on the road, he blurted out ""bald boy"", but he heard it. The ""fake foreign devil"" raised the ""mourning stick"", so he quickly shrank his neck and waited for a beating. He ate several sticks and did not dare to fight back at all. In the real society, such people who bully the weak and fear the strong can be seen everywhere, which is very angry. At the same time, we said that ""bullying the weak and fearing the strong"" does not only show in treating people, For example, in the process of postgraduate examination, many students also have the characteristics of ""bullying the weak and fearing the strong"". For the subjects they are interested in, they always feel at ease with the subjects they are learning, and they are always able to review them first, review them more, and be willing to review them; For those more difficult subjects, the links where they are weak always want to escape, and always hope to find a shortcut. They can not settle down to take them seriously. They always waver between making up their minds to study well and constantly denying and forgiving themselves. ""Bullying the weak and fearing the strong"" is an abandonment mentality of not trying to deceive yourself, which has a serious negative impact on your subject review and postgraduate success. Students must get rid of this bad habit. Don't ""take advantage of others'shorts"" The third characteristic of Ah Q is ""good at speculation"". For example, in terms of attitude towards revolution, Ah Q has always hated revolution, but when he saw the ""panic look of a group of birds and women in Weizhuang (on the eve of the revolution)"", he thought: ""The revolution is good, too. It's terrible! ! Too hateful! Even I want to surrender to the revolutionaries."" The purpose of Ah Q's revolution is just for his own interests. ""I want what I want and who I like"". Of course, what we are talking about here is more focused on the learning level, but the principle is the same, that is, speculation is not good. Speculation first goes into a misunderstanding from the perspective of attitude. In terms of postgraduate review, too many students can not be pragmatic. They always think that they can achieve good results without effort or hard work. I don't know that days are wasted in this way. There is a road in the book mountain, and diligence is the way. There is no way to learn. If you want to succeed, you must go through unremitting efforts. Never take chances. Don't ""deceive yourself"" The fourth characteristic of Ah Q is ""deceiving yourself"", that is, ""the method of spiritual victory"". When Ah Q fought with others and suffered a loss, he thought: ""I have been beaten by my son. Now the world is really不像样. My son has started to beat my father."" Then he was satisfied with his victory. Many people promote this spiritual victory approach, but in learning, this spiritual victory is absolutely undesirable. We have contacted many students. When reviewing, there will always be some situations. When they encounter some difficult questions or questions that are not very good, they will comfort themselves and say, never mind, this question type is too biased and not easy to test; Sometimes I am lazy and don't want to review. I will say nothing to myself. I will have a rest for a few days, and it will have no effect, and so on. These are typical self-deception. Self deception is essentially a kind of indulgence and irresponsibility to oneself, which is not good for both study and life. I hope you can stay away from this ""self-deception"". Don't be a slave to learning. The fifth characteristic of Ah Q is ""slavery"". This is reflected in some students, who can not actively learn, but always feel forced to learn passively. Before university, everyone studied under the supervision and control of teachers and parents. They learned, but they did not develop good self-study habits. Once they get rid of the supervision, they immediately begin to relax. This state may not be obvious before entering college. Once you enter college, you get rid of the once tense learning environment, and there is no need to supervise teachers and parents. A large number of students are lost in the state of enjoyment and relaxation. Many people say that today's college students are very ""slave"" in their studies, mainly because they do not take the initiative to learn and can not take the initiative to learn. Instead, they are forced to learn passively. But for the postgraduate examination, such a long process of hard struggle requires everyone to be able to learn actively, because no one will remind you, supervise you or help you. Everything depends on yourself. Therefore, don't be a ""slave"" to learning, but be the master. Because of Ah Q's typical spirit, it caused his tragic life. We should learn a lesson from it. We should not be the new era of Ah Q, and we should not bring the spirit of Ah Q to our life and study.

“阳光神童”难适留学生活铩羽美国名校新仔走天涯国外大学已经陆续开学有一段时间了，面对全新的生活学习环境，刚去的留学(微博)生特别是一些小留学生们能适应吗？记者了解到，国外的高中教育虽然没有国内高考的压力，但课业其实并不轻松。课业和生活两大压力，使许多从小就没离开过父母的留学生们难以适应，产生了许多问题。17岁的留学生蓉蓉(化名)就面临着这样的压力，她向记者详细讲述了自己从意气风发去留学到无奈“被回国”的经历。她的经历，或许对那些正打算留学的家长和孩子会有些借鉴。我今年17岁，原本应该在国内某个高中读高二，可前不久我却躲在异国他乡的宿舍里蒙头痛哭。当时我已经很久没有见到爸爸妈妈和以前的同学了，而新的老师和同学我也不想见。终于，我的状况让学校知道了，结果被学校劝回国休学。意气风发：“阳光神童”赴美从小，我就被认为是一个智力超群的女孩，不用付出太多的努力，班里的“头把交椅”就一定是我的。我自认长得也颇过得去，由于经常骑自行车外出郊游，皮肤晒成了健康的小麦色，被周围人赋予了“阳光神童”的美誉。我很喜欢这个绰号。爸爸、妈妈对我寄予了厚望，我也没感受到多大的压力，以我平日的水准，出人头地并非遥不可及。我所在的城市虽然不大，但大家都对孩子的教育非常重视，受周围环境影响，爸爸妈妈在我初二结束时就问我，要不要也去国外完成高中学业，然后顺理成章地挑一所合适的大学继续深造？我的回答当然是“好”，能去一个陌生的国度、接受更棒的教育，这是多么充满诱惑啊！其实我早盘算好了，先去读美国排名前100位的高中，然后再选一所常春藤名校深造，把自己打造成一个学贯中西的精英人物。爸妈很支持我的想法，虽然我们家不算很富裕，而美国排名前100的高中大部分都是私立的，学费非常昂贵，可父母还是咬牙凑出了巨额学费。在经过漫长而复杂的申请、面试、签证等阶段后，初三的暑假，我来到了梦中的美国。回想当时，我是多么踌躇满志、意气风发呀。渐觉失落：发现事事不如人我一直听说，中国的基础教育是世界领先的，所以从不认为自己在学习上会有什么障碍。可事实发现，原来不是。刚开学我就遇到了困难——选课。美国的高中是选课制的，只要在毕业时修完所有的学分就行，至于每年修什么课程由学生自己看着办，完全没有老师指导。在我的概念中，学习不一直都是老师说什么、学生学什么吗？对此，远在国内的父母帮不了我，而周围的同学和老师也不愿帮我，因为在他们看来，这是我的事情，别人不方便插手。于是，在惶恐中我选了一些原来在国内还挺擅长的科目，并且在课程的深度上也选择了中上级别。可是读了一星期，就发现不对劲了。首先是语言，虽然我英语没大问题，但用英语来听课和思考的速度，显然跟不上老师讲解的速度，为此我不得不花更多时间啃书本。那些科目的程度很深，也很难，更要命的是，每天都有大量的回家作业，而这些作业不仅仅是做题，还包括了查资料、做实践、表明自己的论点等，而这些都没有标准答案可循，需要学生综合自己的所学和能力交出答卷。这下我彻底懵了。“第一”好像已是前世的回忆。彻底崩溃：借酒消愁被劝退另一个让我不适应的地方在课外。由于我申请的高中排名非常靠前，云集了来自美国中产阶级家庭的孩子，他们从小受过非常良好的教育，这种教育远远不只是学业上的，而是全方位的。这些孩子都能文能武，每人都有自己擅长的体育和文艺科目。可对从小只重视数理化，忽略其他一切与考试无关的我来说，课外兴趣和爱好几乎是空白。虽然在国内，我经常以“全面发展”为荣，可仅仅是发展了一下，并不精通。对什么都不会的我，美国的同学报以克制但惊讶的眼光，这种眼光生生地把我隔离在他们的世界之外。学习上跟得吃力，生活上处于边缘，我的压力越来越大。我明明已经很努力了，作业还是完不成，考试还是通不过，那些该死的体育、乐器、艺术类课程统统跟不上，甚至去跑个马拉松，我都因晕厥要被送到校医疗站，为什么我到了美国成了弱者！我想不通，觉得周围人都看不起我，于是越来越封闭自己，整天把自己关在宿舍里发呆。我经常在深夜独自跑去学校的操场默默流泪，开始拒绝做一切作业，对偶尔表示关心的同学置之不理。最后，我甚至拒绝继续学习，经常旷课，偷偷买回大瓶烈性酒把自己灌醉，躲在被子里抽泣。终于有一天校方找到我，建议我休学一段时间调整状态和情绪。就这样，崩溃的我被送回了国……留学生要做好心理准备应对中西文化冲击专家解读业内专家表示，从“阳光神童”的案例可以看出，导致她无法顺利适应留美生活的根本原因在于，她对西方教育、文化没有做好充分了解，心理无法应对好中西文化冲击。她希望在留学期间同样保持“学习成绩优异的优越感”，“做同学们的榜样”。可她不明白，国内的“第一”与国外的“第一”大不相同。在国外，要成为“第一”意味着综合能力十分强，比如学习成绩优秀、有特长、博学健谈、社交能力强(甚至有领导力)、社会经验丰富、有社会责任感等，而不只是学业优秀。她应该以积极的心态去看待自己与别人的不同，让自己的内心更强大，增强抗压意识，学会用多元思维看待事物，并且用有效的方法不断地提升自己，而不是一味地否定自己。家长方面，必须在出国这个问题上与孩子充分沟通，根据孩子的性格、英语能力、发展方向来决定是否出国。对于学生而言，必须在出国之前多浏览网站，了解更多有关国外教育、社会、法律方面的相关知识。对于有责任的留学服务机构而言，由于他们拥有大量第一手的海外信息和留学生资源，所以，应该在学生出国前，安排好生活、文化、心理层面的系统离境辅导服务。此外，专家建议，学生在选课之前，最好去请教一下已经修过这门课的同学，以便了解课程的难度。刚抵外国的留学生可以去国际学生事务处，多询问关于选课、生活和学习的问题。还可选择自己感兴趣的社团，认识新朋友，融入大家庭，接受新文化。(记者：李琼)	蓉蓉,李琼	负向	"""Sunshine Child Prodigy"" is hard to adapt to the life of studying abroad, and Shaoye goes to the ends of the world. Foreign universities have been open for some time. In the face of a new living and learning environment, can the new students who have just arrived, especially some small international students, adapt? The reporter learned that although the high school education abroad does not have the pressure of the national college entrance examination at home, the course is actually not easy. The two major pressures of study and life make many students who have never left their parents since childhood difficult to adapt, which leads to many problems. Rongrong, a 17-year-old overseas student (pseudonym), is under such pressure, and she told the reporter in detail about her experience from going abroad to study with high hopes to being ""forced to return home"" reluctantly. Her experience may be helpful to parents and children who are going to study abroad. I am 17 years old. I should be in Grade 2 of a high school in China, but recently I was hiding in my dormitory in a foreign country, crying with a headache. At that time, I had not seen my mother and father and my former classmates for a long time, and I didn't want to see my new teachers and classmates. Finally, my condition made the school know that I was advised to return to China for a leave of absence. Frustrated and full of energy: ""Sunshine Child Prodigy"" went to the United States. Since my childhood, I have been regarded as an intelligent girl. I don't need to pay too much effort. The ""top position"" in the class must be mine. I think I look pretty good too. Because I often ride a bike to go out for an excursion, my skin is sunburned with healthy wheat, and I am given the美誉of ""Sunshine Child Prodigy"" by people around me. I like this nickname very much. My father and mother have high hopes for me, and I don't feel much pressure. With my usual level, it is not beyond reach to stand out. Although the city where I live is not big, everyone pays great attention to children's education. Influenced by the surrounding environment, my mother and father asked me when I was in the second year of junior high school whether I would like to go abroad to complete my high school education and then choose a suitable university for further study? My answer was of course ""yes"". It was so tempting to go to a strange country and receive a better education! In fact, I have already planned to go to the top 100 high schools in the United States first, and then choose an Ivy League university for further study to make myself an elite with a combination of Chinese and Western learning. My parents fully support my idea. Although our family is not very rich, and most of the top 100 high schools in the United States are private, the tuition is very expensive, but my parents still make a lot of money. After a long and complicated process of application, interview, visa and other stages, I came to my dream America in the summer of junior three. Looking back, I was so ambitious and full of energy. Gradually, I felt lost: I found that everything was inferior to others. I have always heard that China's basic education is leading the world, so I never thought I would have any obstacles in my studies. But the fact is that it is not. When I started school, I encountered difficulties - selecting courses. American high schools are elective, and students can graduate as long as they have completed all credits when they graduate. As for what courses to take every year, students can do it themselves. There is no teacher to guide them at all. In my opinion, learning has always been what the teacher said and what the student learned? In this regard, my parents who are far away in China can't help me, and the students and teachers around me are not willing to help me, because in their view, this is my business, and others are inconvenient to intervene. So, in fear, I chose some subjects that were originally quite good in China, and I also chose the middle and upper level in terms of the depth of the course. But after reading for a week, I found something wrong. First of all, language. Although my English is not a big problem, the speed of listening and thinking in English obviously does not keep up with the speed of the teacher's explanation. For this reason, I have to spend more time chewing books. These subjects are very deep and difficult. What is more fatal is that there are a lot of homework every day, and these homework are not only questions, but also include data retrieval, practice, and indication of their own arguments, and there are no standard answers to follow, which requires students to integrate their learning and abilities to give answers. Now I'm completely confused. ""First"" seems to be a memory of the past. Total collapse: Drinking to relieve sorrow and being discouraged. Another place where I am not used to is after class. Because the high school I applied for is very high ranking, it is crowded with children from American middle-class families. They have received very good education since childhood, which is far more than academic, but all-round. These children can both write and fight. Each of them has his own sports and artistic subjects. But for me, who has only focused on physics and chemistry since childhood and ignored everything irrelevant to the examination, extracurricular interests and hobbies are almost blank. Although in China, I often take ""all-round development"" as my honor, but I just develop a little, but I am not good at it. For me, who can do nothing, my American classmates give me a restrained but surprising look, which isolates me from their world. Learning is hard to follow, and life is marginal, my pressure is growing. I have obviously worked very hard, but I still can't finish my homework, and I still can't pass the exam. Those damned sports, musical instruments and art classes are all behind. Even if I go to run a marathon, I have to be sent to the school medical station because of fainting. Why do I become a weak person when I come to the United States! I don't understand, I think everyone around me looks down on me, so I close myself more and more, and lock myself in the dormitory all day long. I often ran to the school playground alone in the dead of night to cry silently, and began to refuse to do all my homework, ignoring the students who occasionally expressed concern. Finally, I even refused to continue my studies, often skipped classes, and secretly bought back a large bottle of strong wine to get drunk and hide in my quilt to cry. Finally, one day, the school found me and suggested that I take a leave of absence for some time to adjust my status and emotions. In this way, the collapsed me was sent back to China... Overseas students should be well prepared to deal with the impact of Chinese and Western cultures. Experts interpret industry experts that it can be seen from the case of ""Sunshine Child Prodigy"" that the fundamental reason why she can not adapt to the life of studying in the United States is that she has not fully understood Western education and culture, and her psychology can not deal with the impact of Chinese and Western cultures. She hoped to maintain the ""superior sense of excellent academic performance"" during her study abroad, and ""to be a model for students"". But she didn't understand that ""the first"" in China is very different from ""the first"" abroad. Abroad, to be ""the first"" means that the comprehensive ability is very strong, such as excellent academic performance, special skills, erudition and talkativeness, strong social skills (or even leadership), rich social experience, and social responsibility, rather than just academic excellence. She should look at her differences with others in a positive way, make her heart stronger, enhance her anti pressure awareness, learn to look at things with diversified thinking, and constantly improve herself with effective methods, rather than just deny herself. Parents must fully communicate with their children on the issue of going abroad, and decide whether to go abroad according to their children's personality, English ability, development direction. For students, they must browse more websites before going abroad to learn more about foreign education, society, law, etc. For responsible overseas study service agencies, since they have a large number of first-hand overseas information and overseas students' resources, they should arrange systematic departure counseling services at the living, cultural and psychological levels before students go abroad. In addition, experts suggest that before students choose courses, it is best to ask students who have studied this course to learn about the difficulty of the course. Overseas students who have just arrived in a foreign country can go to the International Students Office to ask more questions about course selection, life and study. You can also choose your own club, make new friends, integrate into the family, and accept new culture. (Reporter: Li Qiong)"

侯耀文小女友被曝净身出户时报讯因追加两项起诉内容而推迟审理的“侯门遗产”一案，经过了十几天默默无闻的蛰伏，前日，侯瓒代理律师苏向祥表示，在法院调查取证当天，侯耀华一方无人到场，据分析，被告可能提出管辖权异议。8月4日，本案原告侯瓒新增两项要求，再次向北京西城法院递交起诉状：一、侯耀文的所有银行账户要查明，因为此前法院查侯耀文财产时，只查了4家银行，其余银行未查；二、侯耀文葬礼上亲朋的份子钱，加上侯耀文徒弟每人出了1万元，两项加起来约60万元也在被告侯耀华手里，这也要追加进来。为此，原定7月30日开庭并网络直播的案件推迟审理，双方进入答辩状整理阶段。如今，十几天时间过去，苏向祥律师称，截至昨日下午5时，双方证据整理时间结束，需向法院提交新修答辩状。另据报道，被侯瓒起诉的三人中并未出现父亲侯耀文的小女友陈一嘉的名字，对此，网上一直有人猜测，小女友陈一嘉免遭起诉，原因在于侯耀文遗体告别仪式上，侯瓒看到父亲两位前妻都未出席，只有跟自己差不多大的陈一嘉“忙前忙后”，感动之余产生动容之情。对此，苏向祥称“没有这回事”。他表示，陈一嘉离开玫瑰园时可谓净身出户，“就我方现有证据显示，陈一嘉离开玫瑰园时主要带走了一些属于她的衣物等私人物品。法院如果认为有必要，才会追加”。近日，还不满30岁的陈一嘉在博客上载了许多美国游记，看来已摆脱掉案件影响的她，开始了自己的全新生活。另外，就侯耀文前两任妻子未出席追悼会一事，苏律师表示这是“情理之中，毕竟现在大家都有了各自生活”。	侯耀文,侯耀华,侯瓒,陈一嘉,苏向祥	正向	"The small girlfriend of Hou Yaowen was exposed to the Times News on the grounds that the ""Hou Gate Heritage"" case was postponed for more than ten days of obscurity due to the addition of two new起诉contents. The day before yesterday, Su Xiangxiang, the lawyer of Hou Zuan, said that there was no one from Hou Yaohua on the day when the court investigated and obtained evidence. It is analyzed that the defendant may raise jurisdictional objections. On August 4, the plaintiff, Hou Zuan, added two new requirements and submitted a new complaint to the West City Court of Beijing again: 1. All bank accounts of Hou Yaowen should be found out, because when the court checked Hou Yaowen's property, only four banks were checked, and the rest were not checked; 2. The funeral money of relatives and friends at Hou Yaowen's funeral, plus 10000 yuan from each of Hou Yaowen's apprentices, is also about 600000 yuan in the hands of the defendant Hou Yaohua, which should also be added in. As a result, the case originally scheduled to open on July 30 and broadcast on the Internet was postponed for trial, and both sides entered the stage of consolidating the answer document. Now that more than ten days have passed, Lawyer Su Xiangxiang said that as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the time for both sides to organize evidence has ended, and a new revised answer is needed to be submitted to the court. According to another report, the name of Chen Yijia, the little girlfriend of his father Hou Yaowen, did not appear among the three people sued by Hou Zuan. In this regard, there has always been speculation on the Internet that Chen Yijia, the little girlfriend, was exempt from being sued because Hou Zuan saw that neither of his father's two ex wives were present at the funeral ceremony of Hou Yaowen's remains, but Chen Yijia, who was about the same age as him, was ""busy"", which moved him. In this regard, Su Xiangxiang said ""there is no such thing"". He said that Chen Yijia left the Rose Garden in a very clean way. According to the existing evidence of our side, Chen Yijia mainly took away some of her personal belongings when she left the Rose Garden. The court will only add if it is necessary. Recently, Chen Yijia, who is less than 30 years old, has uploaded many American travel notes on her blog, which seems to have got rid of the influence of the case, and has started her new life. In addition, with regard to the fact that Hou Yaowen's first two wives did not attend the memorial service, Lawyer Su said that this was ""reasonable, after all, everyone has their own life now""."

《超人前传》第八季九月回归几大主角发生巨变新浪娱乐讯在即将播出的第八季中，《超人前传》(Smallville)将经历一次重大的变革。近日在圣地亚哥动漫展上，四位制作人凯莉-桑德斯(KellySouders)、布莱恩-彼得森(BrianPeterson)、托德-斯拉维京(ToddSlavkin)、戴伦-斯维默(DarrenSwimmer)介绍了新的一季，仍然收到很多剧迷的欢迎。虽然还是《超人前传》，但是很多角色都将发生变化。目前可以确定的是，男主角克拉克(Clark)将在第八季里正式转变为超人。除了开始双重身份的生活外，他还将与埃莉卡-杜兰斯(EricaDurance)扮演的露易丝-莱恩(LoisLane)一起去星球日报工作。有些剧迷可能会担心《超人前传》变得跟90年代电视连续剧《超人》(Lois&Clark)雷同，但是制作人彼得森保证不会发生这样的情况。“那不是我们这部剧的风格，也不是观众熟悉的我们的角色的风格。”他介绍说，两人在一起工作会擦出火花，也有关系紧张的时候，因此会很有看头，但整体人物风格不会改变。除了克拉克与露易丝擦出火花，在第八季中，克拉克与克洛伊(Chloe)之间的关系也是很有看头的。“两人之间会有很多暗藏的压力，性关系的压力，感情的压力。”彼得森介绍说。在展览中，制作人没有透露莱克斯-卢瑟(LexLuthor)的扮演者迈克尔-罗森鲍姆(MichaelRosenbaum)是否会回到剧中，但是他们透露拉娜-朗(LanaLang)的扮演者克斯汀-克鲁克(KristinKreuk)将回归。第八季的第五集，她将再次出现，不过很有可能不再是观众熟悉的那个拉娜了。斯拉维京介绍说：“她看起来不同了，不再是我们熟悉的拉娜。她长大了，离开了小镇，以一个女人的身份回来。很显然结婚使她变成一个女人，但是她其实还是个孩子。”拉娜开始了新生活，而贾斯汀-哈特利(JustinHartley)扮演的奥利弗-奎恩(OliverQueen)将探求自己的过去，他将揭示绿箭的起源。将一起探究奥利弗是如何变成绿箭的，为什么是他成为绿箭，以及他是如何学会射箭的。哈特利还谈了他的角色面临的挑战。奥利弗将有点伤心，他开始审视自己为之牺牲的东西，想知道究竟值不值得。《超人前传》第八季9月18日晚回归。龙龙/文声明：新浪网独家稿件，转载请注明出处。	克斯汀-克鲁克,拉娜-朗,凯莉-桑德斯,哈特利,埃莉卡-杜兰斯,克拉克,洛克斯-卢瑟,龙龙,贾斯汀-哈特利,迈克尔-罗森鲍姆,Michael,Kelly,Lois,洛伊丝-莱恩,斯拉维京,达伦-斯维默,戴伦-斯维默,Justin,奥利弗-奎恩,布莱恩-彼得森,克洛伊,托德	正向	"""Smallville"" returns in September for a major change in the main characters of the eighth season. Sina Entertainment News In the upcoming eighth season, Smallville will undergo a major change. Recently, at the San Diego Comic Convention, four producers, Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson, Todd Slavkin and Darren Swimmer, introduced the new season, which is still welcomed by many drama fans. Although it is still ""Smallville"", many roles will change. At present, it is certain that the male protagonist Clark (Clark) will officially transform into Superman in the eighth season. In addition to starting a double life, he will also work with Lois Lane (Lois Lane), played by Erica Duran, at the Daily Planet. Some drama fans may worry that Smallville will be similar to the 1990s TV series Superman (Lois & Clark), but producer Peterson assured that this would not happen. ""That's not the style of our play, nor the style of our characters that the audience is familiar with."" He introduced that the two people will spark when they work together, and there will also be tension, so it will be very interesting to watch, but the overall character style will not change. In addition to Clark's spark with Lois, Clark's relationship with Chloe in the eighth season is also very interesting. ""There will be a lot of hidden pressure between the two people, pressure of sexual relations, and pressure of feelings."" Peterson introduced. At the exhibition, the producers did not reveal whether Michael Rosenbaum, the actor who plays Lex Luthor (Lex Luthor), will return to the play, but they revealed that Kristin Kreuk, the actor who plays Lana Lang (Lana Lang), will return. In the fifth episode of the eighth season, she will appear again, but it is likely that she will no longer be the Lana that the audience is familiar with. Slavinin introduced: ""She looks different, no longer the Lana we are familiar with. She grew up, left the town and returned as a woman. Obviously, marriage makes her a woman, but she is still a child."" Lana started a new life, and Justin Hartley, who plays Oliver Queen (Oliver Queen), will explore his past, revealing the origin of Green Arrow. Together with Oliver, we will explore how he became the Green Arrow, why he became the Green Arrow, and how he learned to shoot. Hartley also talked about the challenges faced by his role. Oliver will be a little sad. He began to examine what he sacrificed, and wondered if it was worth it. ""Smallville"" returns on the evening of September 18 for the eighth season.

比利时球王携幼子参加中国公开赛爱妻身材火辣(图)3月28日下午，使用星牌台球桌的2010三元食品世界斯诺克中国公开赛在球手下榻的新世纪日航饭店召开了新闻发布会。除了诸多世界顶级球星之外，会场上还有一位来宾引起了记者们的兴趣，那就是比利时球手汉尼威尔的女友黛西。彼乔恩-汉尼威尔是比利时最为著名的斯诺克球手，他曾夺得过六次比利时斯诺克锦标赛的冠军，欧洲锦标赛和世界运动会也都曾稳定或跻身三甲。2003年在德国进行的欧洲锦标赛和07年的比利时锦标赛上，汉尼威尔还都打出了147的满分杆。平时还会为荷兰语的欧洲体育台进行解说。另外，汉尼威尔也是目前职业台球界唯一的比利时球员，03/04赛季世界排名达到最高的第53名。阔别职业巡回赛两个赛季之后，汉尼威尔凭借08/09赛季庞汀斯系列赛第四名的成绩于09/10赛季重回职业巡回赛。09/10赛季汉尼威尔不但通过了中国公开赛的资格赛，还在世锦赛的资格赛上打出单杆138分刷新了个人职业生涯的单杆最高分。实际上，这并不是汉尼威尔第一次来到中国，2000年中国公开赛，汉尼威尔曾以3-5不敌亨德利，首轮出局。这一次，汉尼威尔并非只身前来。身为父亲的他，不但将“孩儿他娘”黛西带来了北京，就连还叼着奶嘴的小宝宝也一同带了来。已为人母的黛西依然保养得很好，黑色低胸装让她的火辣身材一览无余，不知道秒杀了多少记者们的镜头。看来，这次汉尼威尔是计划带着家人好好游览一下初春的京城了。只是希望下周的北京不要像前几天那样猛刮沙尘暴才好，和风暖阳才是春游的好天气嘛！不过，坐在球员席的汉尼威尔却似乎并没有引起太多记者的注意，大家的目光仍然都集中在希金斯、丁俊晖和亨德利等超级大牌的身上，这也使得汉尼威尔并不是唯一受到如此“冷遇”的球手。虽然迈克劳德是当今黑人中斯诺克打得最好的，虽然瓦塔纳和苏珀分别是泰国过去和现在的顶尖人物，但他们的的行动和就自由多了。迈克劳德在酒店里面来去自由，闲庭信步地听着音乐闲逛，穿梭于球迷之间却没有人找他签名，瓦塔纳和苏珀更是在一位泰国球迷的陪同下，出去转悠找吃的去了。(TOP147.汐凉)	瓦塔纳,丁俊晖,迈克劳德,亨德利,黛西,苏珀,希金斯,汉尼威尔	正向	"The Belgian ball king attended the China Open with his young son. His wife's figure was hot. (Picture) On the afternoon of March 28, the 2010 Sanyuan Food World Snooker China Open, which used the star brand billiard table, held a press conference at the ball player's hotel, the New Century Rihang Hotel. In addition to many top players in the world, there was another guest at the conference who attracted the interest of the journalists, namely Daisy, the girlfriend of Belgian player Hannibal. Bjorn Hannibal is the most famous snooker player in Belgium. He has won the Belgian Snooker Championship six times, and the European Championship and the World Games have also been stable or ranked in the top three. Hannibal also scored a full score of 147 in the European Championships held in Germany in 2003 and the Belgian Championships in 07 years. I also give explanations for the Dutch European Sports Channel. In addition, Hannibal is also the only Belgian player in the current professional billiards industry, and his world ranking reached the highest of 53 in the 03/04 season. After two seasons away from the professional tour, Hannibal returned to the professional tour in the 09/10 season with the fourth place in the Pontins Series in the 08/09 season. In the 09/10 season, Hannibal not only passed the qualification round of the China Open, but also scored a single shot of 138 points in the qualification round of the World Championships, updating his personal career's highest single shot score. In fact, this is not the first time that Hannibal has come to China. In the 2000 China Open, Hannibal lost in the first round with a score of 3-5 to Hendley. This time, Hannibal did not come alone. As a father, he not only brought Daisy, his ""child's mother"", to Beijing, but also brought the baby with a pacifier. Daisy, who has been a mother, is still well preserved. The black low chest dress shows her hot figure, I don't know how many reporters' cameras were killed. It seems that this time, Hannibal planned to take his family for a tour of the capital in early spring. I just hope that Beijing next week will not have a sandstorm like the one in the past few days. It's a good weather for spring outing with a breeze and warm sun! However, Hannibal, sitting in the player's seat, did not seem to attract much attention from the media. Everyone's attention was still focused on the superstars such as Higgins, Ding Junhui and Hendry, which also made Hannibal not the only player who received such a ""cold encounter"". Although Maiklaud is the best snooker player among the black people today, Watana and Suooper are Thailand's top figures in the past and now respectively, their actions are much freer. Maiklaud is free to come and go in the hotel, listening to music and wandering around, but no one asks him to sign autographs among fans. Watana and Suooper went out to look for food with the accompaniment of a Thai fan. (TOP147. Xi Liang)"
专辑《15》引两极评论方大同：我不要那么暴力早前在台湾宣传新碟时，方大同被颁发“小巨肺”。在新碟中，他作出不少新尝试。●时隔3年，方大同推出全新创作专辑《15》，包办全碟作曲与编曲，还写了超过一般的歌词。如此投入与卖力，却引发争议。●本报鉴定：音乐人真不易做，不变，会被指责“固步自封”；一旦改变不大，则容易被说“浅尝辄止”。其实对于大部分乐迷来说，能被几首歌打动，让耳朵获得数十分钟享受，就够了吧。南都讯记者朱燕霞实习生黄丹婷戴黑框眼镜、穿格子衬衫，唱着骚灵和R&B的音乐，这是一贯的方大同。不温不火，这是外界给予他个人及其音乐风格最多的评价。但这一次，新专辑《15》似乎有了变化：评论两极化，一贯的喜爱与直接的抗拒——有人喜见他的新突破，他融合蓝调、Rock、骚灵、R&B多种音乐类型的尝试；也有人大失所望，对他的唱腔演绎、浅白歌词、主题概念等都一一诟病。“这张专辑无论在音乐上及我想与大家分享的故事或思考的内容，对我是一项挑战，同时对听众亦会是个挑战”，方大同在专辑中这么写，对于听众可能出现的反应，他似乎早已预见。本月初，方大同带着个人第五张创作大碟《15》到内地多个城市巡回宣传，前天下午，他与南都记者在广州见面，聊起《15》引发的很不客气的争议之声，最后还聊起了他“烂gag王”。方大同说：“这张专辑的制作是最好的，新的变化、新的标准是更好的，但我做的是黑人音乐。”争议1新花样浅尝辄止回应：这就是我想做的摇滚新专辑共收录了11首歌，由方大同、EdwardChan、CharlesLee负责监制，方大同包办了全碟的作曲与编曲，还填写了超过一半的歌词。专辑大体上延续其以往积极正面的歌曲态度及清新的感觉，连劝诫年轻人勿吸食毒品的《无菇朋友》，旋律照样清新雅致。尽管如此，方大同对音乐的求变态度，在该专辑中也能体现。比如在演绎上不再是“一人骚”，而是拉上陈兆基、李一丁两位新拍档组成的乐队；在编曲上，复古吉他音效和长号组、solo段落、老式灵歌的唱腔等对乐迷而言都相当有新鲜感。对于这种变化，有人觉得欣喜，但也有人认为一切变化都只是“浅尝辄止”，在Bandsound之中，方大同的唱腔没有很好表现，摇滚做得“不够彻底”。面对这些质疑，方大同回应：“虽然都是黑人音乐，R&B就比较温和轻唱，蓝调的唱腔就会多一点态度，多一点点玩声音的部分。(演唱部分)要盖过乐队是很容易做出来的，只要我混音时候调大(就可以)。有人觉得摇滚就一定要让人声盖过所有的乐器，但我觉得没必要，我觉得不只要让乐迷听到人的声音，也要听编曲上的东西。”方大同说，他所喜欢的摇滚是如JimiHendrix(吉米·亨德里克斯)、TheWhiteStripes(白色条纹乐队)那一类城市骚灵风格的音乐，“有的人觉得做了摇滚，可能又觉得我做的摇滚不够彻底的，但他懂的摇滚只是一部分。”争议2歌词简单内容单薄回应：我不需要那么直白一直以来坚持做创作的方大同，这次在词作上比以往投入了更多的精力，11首歌中有8首词作都有他的参与，但质量却受到诸多诟病。有乐评人认为，这次“少了周耀辉的加持，方大同的音乐就像缺了一条伏线”，不少乐迷也认为歌词过于简单而令内容过于单薄，削弱了歌曲的意境。甚至有歌迷误解了歌词的意思，其中清新文雅的《无菇朋友》原来是“反毒”题材就让不少人愣了愣。南都记者将这个问题抛给方大同，他哈哈笑了几声，说：“我不需要那么直白，那么暴力。我看某些英文歌词也不太明白，要慢慢研究。有的歌写出来，除非他(指词作者)坐下跟你谈，你才可能完全明白他的意思。比如《无菇朋友》里，的‘我走过红地毯’，看过(引发我灵感的新闻)报道就知道，这句话的意思是警察到了，地毯全都是血，而且有人死在沙发上……”方大同解释，“我一向有写词，这次写多了是因为很多曲子不适合之前帮我写过词的人。这次风格是蓝调摇滚，句子的结构、所配合的唱腔，其实不是太适合一般中文的作词方式。”专辑名解析15，是方大同开始学吉他的年龄专辑命名为“15”，这个数字是方大同开始学吉他的年龄，也意味着他这次要回归与吉他相关的内容。音乐风格方面，他在骚灵及R&B的基础上，用蓝调和Rock进行点缀，做一张“UrbanBlues/Rock”(注：城市布鲁斯/摇滚乐)。他介绍，此番尝试是受到JohnMayer(约翰。梅尔)《Contin-uum》的启发，以及蓝调吉他手EricClapton(埃里克·帕特里克·克莱普顿)、JimiHendrix(吉米·亨德里克斯)、B.B.King等的人影响。加上他在生活中有了更多的观察体验，而在歌中触及环保、反毒、爱情婚姻等内容。题外话听方大同讲烂Gag方大同总是让人感觉“温和正经”：他习惯去同一家餐厅，点固定几个菜；他说话声音不会太大，语速也不会太快，温文有礼；他绯闻不多，常常歌唱爱情但感情空窗期已有六年。专辑《15》不例外地有多首爱情歌曲，如受电影《叶问2》启发写下《张永成》描述叶问渴望回家看妻儿，《情胜策略》批判时下年轻人将爱情当游戏，《二人游》讲一个男生第三者说不……谈到爱情话题，方大同说自己心仪的对象仍未出现，但希望35岁前结婚。方大同说自己是个慢热的人，“我喜欢观察，喜欢听，但在朋友中也算是比较多话。”记者顺水推舟请方大同讲个冷笑话，他说：“讲完怕你对我印象不好”，随后还是贡献了两个小段子：“别人问我，为什么自己没有打算结婚没有交女朋友，我说看缘分嘛，工作太忙，录音制作的。他不相信，我说你看我微博，因为我要混音，所以没有婚姻。”“我有个发型师叫做Carl，别人问我他在哪，我说在停车场。”(Carl与car——汽车——发音相近)	EdwardChan,方大同,朱燕霞,周耀辉,李一丁,陈兆基,吉米·亨德里克斯,埃里克·帕特里克·克莱普顿,黄丹婷,CharlesLee,约翰。梅尔	正向	"The album ""15"" causes two polarized reviews. Fong Datong: I don't want so much violence. When he promoted his new album in Taiwan earlier, Fong Datong was awarded ""Little Giant Lung"". In the new album, he made a lot of new attempts. ● Three years later, Fong Datong launched a new creative album ""15"", which includes music composition and arrangement for the whole album, and wrote more than the usual lyrics. Such devotion and effort, however, triggered controversy. ● Our newspaper identified that it is really hard to do music. If it is unchangeable, it will be criticized as ""standing still""; If there is not much change, it is easy to say ""stop and go"". In fact, for most music fans, it is enough to be moved by several songs and let their ears enjoy for tens of minutes. Nandu News reporter Zhu Yanxia, intern Huang Danting, wearing black rimmed glasses and checkered shirts, sings the music of Saoling and R&B, which is always the same as Fong Datong. Not cold or hot, this is the most common evaluation given by the outside world to his personal and music style. But this time, the new album ""15"" seems to have changed: the comments are polarized, and the consistent love and direct rejection - some people are happy to see his new breakthrough, and he combines blues, Rock, Saoling and R&B in many ways; Some people were very disappointed with his singing style, simple lyrics, theme concept and so on. ""This album is a challenge to me in terms of music and the stories or thoughts I want to share with you, and it will also be a challenge to listeners,"" Fong writes in the album, as if he has foreseen the possible reaction of listeners. Earlier this month, Fong Datong brought his fifth personal creation album ""15"" to a number of cities in the mainland for publicity. Yesterday afternoon, he met with Nandu journalists in Guangzhou to talk about the very rude controversy caused by ""15"", and finally talked about his ""bad gag king"". Fong Datong said: ""This album is the best in production, new changes and new standards are better, but I do black music."" Controversy 1 New patterns stop responding: This is what I want to do. The new album includes 11 songs, which are produced by Fong Datong, Edward Chan and Charles Lee. Fong Datong is responsible for the music composition and arrangement of the whole album, and he also fills in more than half of the lyrics. The album basically continues his positive and positive song attitude and fresh feeling in the past. Even the song of ""Friends without Fung"" to dissuade young people from taking drugs is still fresh and elegant. Nevertheless, Fong Datong's attitude of changing music can also be reflected in this album. For example, instead of ""one person's骚”, he pulled on the band composed of two new partners, Chen Zhaoji and Li Yiding; In terms of arrangement, the retro guitar sound effect, trombone group, solo paragraph, and the singing style of old spirit are quite fresh to music fans. For this change, some people feel happy, but others think that all changes are just ""tasteless"", and Fang Datong's singing style is not well expressed in Bandsound, and the rock music is ""not thorough enough"". In the face of these doubts, Fong Datong responded: ""Although they are all black music, R&B is more gentle and light singing, and the singing style of blues will have more attitude and more space to play sound. (Singing part) It's easy to cover the band. Just mix it up (you can). Some people think that rock must let the voice cover all the instruments, but I don't think it's necessary. I think it's necessary to let music fans hear the sound of people, and also to listen to the music arrangement."" Fong Datong said that the rock he likes is the urban spirit style of music such as Jimi Hendrix (Jimi Hendrix) and The White Stripes (White Stripe Band), ""Some people think that doing rock may make them think that my rock is not thorough enough, but they only know a part of rock."" Controversy 2 Simple lyrics and thin content Response: I don't need to be so straightforward. Fong Datong, who has always been committed to creation, has invested more energy in this word than before. He participated in eight of the eleven songs, but the quality has been criticized. Some music critics believe that this ""less Zhou Yaohui's support, Fong Datong's music is like a missing伏line"", and many music fans also think that the lyrics are too simple to make the content too thin, which weakens the artistic conception of the song. Even some fans misunderstood the meaning of the lyrics. The fresh and elegant ""No Fung Friends"" was originally an anti drug theme, which made many people stunned. Nandu reporters threw this question to Fong Datong, who laughed and said: ""I don't need to be so straightforward or violent. I don't understand some English lyrics very well. I have to study slowly. Some songs are written. Unless he (referring to the lyricist) sits down and talks with you, you may fully understand his meaning. For example, 'I walked on the red carpet' in ""No Fung Friends"", I know that the meaning of this sentence is that the police have arrived, the carpet is full of blood, and someone has died on the sofa..."" Fong Datong explained"
收评：期市多头全线爆发油脂类集体冲高新浪财经讯周四，国内期市大宗商品全线上涨，油脂类品种集体走强，豆油、棕榈油、菜油盘中均创下一年新高，橡胶、棉花、有色金属也有不错涨幅，化工品，农产品大多小幅上涨。油脂类今日09连豆油持仓量增加，阻力位在10800、11000，近期或延续震荡上行态势，建议多单须持。美豆布林线有向上扩口的迹象，本周后半段美豆或试探14美元。昨日美国经济数据利好，导致美元大幅反弹，商品集体上涨，美豆也反弹至13.9美元。阿根廷本周末天气将恢复干旱，为美豆走势提供支撑。今晚美国农业部将公布出口销售报告，如销售数据利好，则美豆将继续看涨。因美豆与美其他作物比价关系仍处于均值以下，后市看涨，多单须持。同时，美所有农产品中油籽需求增长最快，且种植最为困难，支撑美豆价格。马棕榈油产量减少导致的库存下降将令豆类油脂受到较强支撑。今日国内油脂受美豆反弹影响创出新高，持仓量增加，后市将继续震荡走高，但短期或有震荡风险，建议投资者做多思路不变，逢低勇敢加仓。美国农业部1月12号将公布美作物供需报告，该报告或令豆类油脂上涨加速。[全文]橡胶技术来看，沪胶1105合约周四高开于前期高点实体之上，日内下探上一交易日收盘价格受到支撑回升，形态来看，均线呈多头排列，上涨趋势良好。指标来看，均线，MACD,KDJ均呈现金叉，出现较好入场点。但是目前沪胶处于前期高位，面临压力较大，追高需谨慎。整体而言，沪胶基本面依旧提供支撑，技术方面，均线呈现多头排列，上涨趋势线完好，后市沪胶突破前高指日可待。操作上建议前期多单继续持有。[全文]沪铜今日沪铜高位振荡，价格高开冲高后振荡回落，收盘仍上涨。受外盘探底回升提振，主力合约Cu1104以72010跳空高开，盘中一度72490，不过受国内股市疲软影响，铜价振荡回落，收盘于72020元，比上日收盘价涨740元。今日成交萎缩，成交19.1万手左右，总持仓减少8414手至338696手。今日铜价止跌反弹，价格重新站上5日均线之上，令短线调整暂时中止，不过，今日价格的反弹明显缺乏量和仓的配合，市场仍存在一定的畏高情绪，以逢高减仓为主。目前国内现货铜消费受到高价格抑制，未表现出节前备库的消费需求旺季，现货贴水保持在200-350元间，一定程度上压制了市场的做多人气，铜价将继续保持外强内弱格局，将被动跟随外盘涨势，预计近日沪铜将高位振荡为主，谨慎持有多单。[全文]玉米今日国内玉米市场冲高回落，尽管豆类市场大幅上涨，仍未能有效带动玉米期价，玉米现货供应平稳情况下，大部分资金转战其它波幅较大的品种。目前大连港内玉米平舱价2060-2070元/吨，水分14%，黑龙江新玉米到港价在2020元/吨上下，锦州港玉米平舱价在2070元/吨上下，市场成交依然偏淡。广东港内质量较好的新玉米报价在2160-2180元/吨，陈玉米报价2180-2200元/吨，港口质量较好的玉米走货速度较快，港口玉米库存23万吨左右。近期国内淀粉以及玉米油价格连续走低，下游需求不旺暂不支撑玉米价格上涨，深加工企业在利润下滑的情况下，收购价格有小幅回调的可能。另外，春节马上临近，农民在年前一般会有一个售粮高峰期，玉米的供应数量将会有所增加。不过前期玉米市场收购的主要力量是深加工以及中字头企业，普通贸易商一直没有竞争力，在深加工利润下滑及中字头企业受限的情况下，贸易商可能会抓紧这一售粮时机进行补库，这将限制玉米的下行空间。综合看，玉米市场仍将维持区间整理的走势，震荡区间2310-2360，投资者可进行波段操作，以区间两端为止损。[全文]燃料油周三公布的美国12月民间就业数据意外强于预期，提振市场人气。人力资源服务公司AutomaticDataProcessingInc。(ADP)与咨询机构MacroeconomicAdvisers公布的全美就业报告显示，12月份美国私营部门就业人数增加297,000人。经济学家此前预计，ADP将宣布12月份就业人数增加100,000人。美国能源资料协会(EIA)周三公布的周度库存报告显示，截至12月31日当周，美国原油库存减少416万桶至3.3527亿桶，预估为减少180万桶。周三，美国公布的私营部门就业人数好于预期，同时EIA公布的原油库存的下滑幅度也超出了市场预估，以上基本面因素对冲美元上涨的不利影响，提振原油价格走高，收复90美元关口；沪油方面，由于近期需求不振，价格一直在低位震荡，但4900附近有一定支撑，此处建立的多单可继续持有。[全文]早稻从近期现货市场的表现来看，北方以及华北地区粳稻收购价在稳步抬升，江南地区晚稻收购价相对平稳略有上调，目前早稻市场正处于清淡期，市场中贸易量不足。伴随春节消费高峰期的到来，市场稻米价格有望进一步出现上升。目前国际农产品市场整体上涨格局完好，谷物市场再度寻觅到新的题材支撑，料将使得CBOT农产品期价进一步上涨。国内谷物市场同样受到带动，早稻碍于政策压力，当前上涨势头依然较为缓慢。不过整体上仍将延续震荡走高形势。盘中表现可以看到，近期早稻市场需要周边氛围配合，在缺乏有效支撑的情况下，资金关注度相对不足，因此操作上建议多看少动，或者逢低少量布局阶段性多单。[全文]黄金隔夜美国公布的ISM非制造业指数及ADP就业人数好于预期，提振美元指数大涨，本周五即将公布美国12月非农就业报告，这可能对会黄金形成进一步的指引。回想上次12月3日公布美国11月的失业率高达9.8%远差于预期时，黄金当日应声大涨28美元，但近期的一系列数据均显示美国经济出现了一些回暖迹象，因此，明日公布的非农就业报告至关重要。短期来看，黄金可能会有大跌后技术上的一些反弹，但受制于美元指数的强势，预计反弹力度有限，上方压力位1390美元，下方支撑位1365美元。[全文]		正向	Close evaluation: The multi-head market of the futures market fully broke out, and the集体of oil and fat collectively rushed to Sina Finance to report on Thursday. The domestic futures market commodities rose across the board. The oil and fat varieties collectively strengthened. Soybean oil, palm oil and rape oil all hit a new high in a year. Rubber, cotton and nonferrous metals also rose well. Chemical products and agricultural products mostly rose slightly. Today, 09 Lian Soybean Oil of the oil and fat sector has increased its position, with resistance at 10800 and 11000. In the near future, it may continue to fluctuate upward. It is suggested that the long order must be held. The US soybean Bollinger Line has a tendency to expand upward. In the second half of this week, the US soybean may attempt $14. Yesterday's US economic data was good, leading to a substantial rebound of the US dollar, a collective rise of commodities and a rebound of the US soybean to $13.9. The weather in Argentina will return to drought this weekend, providing support for the trend of soybeans in the United States. Tonight, the US Department of Agriculture will release the export sales report. If the sales data is good, the US soybeans will continue to rise. Because the ratio of US soybeans and other US crops is still below the mean, the future market is bullish, and the long list must be held. At the same time, the oilseed demand growth in all US agricultural products is the fastest and the most difficult to plant, supporting the price of soybeans in the United States. The decline in Malaysian palm oil production will lead to a strong support for bean oil. Today, the domestic oil and fat market hit a new high due to the rebound of soybeans in the United States. The position increased and the market will continue to fluctuate and rise in the future. However, there may be a risk of short-term volatility. It is suggested that investors should remain unchanged in their willingness to make more investments and be brave in adding positions when they are low. The US Department of Agriculture will release the supply and demand report of US crops on January 12, which may accelerate the rise of bean oil. [Full text] Rubber Technically speaking, the Shanghai Rubber 1105 contract opened high on Thursday above the previous high, and the price of the previous trading day rebounded and recovered under the support of the closing price. In terms of shape, the moving average is in a multi headed arrangement, and the upward trend is good. In terms of indicators, the moving average, MACD, KDJ are all gold forks, and there are good entry points. However, at present, Shanghai rubber is at a high level in the earlier period, facing great pressure, and it is necessary to be cautious when chasing high. In general, the Shanghai Rubber fundamentals still provide support. In terms of technology, the moving average shows a multi headed arrangement, and the rising trend line is intact. It is expected that the Shanghai Rubber will break the previous high in the future. It is suggested to continue to hold the long list in the earlier period.

Boosted by the rebound of foreign plates from bottom to top, the main contract Cu1104 jumped to 72010, and once hit 72490 in the market. However, due to the weakness of the domestic stock market, the copper price retreated and closed at 72020 yuan, 740 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. The transaction today shrank, with a turnover of about 191000 hands, and the total position decreased by 8414 hands to 338696 hands. Today, copper prices stopped falling and rebounded, and prices once again stood above the 5 day moving average, temporarily stopping short-term adjustments. However, today's price rebound obviously lacks the cooperation of volume and warehouse, and the market still has a certain fear of heights, mainly in order to reduce positions at a high level. At present, the consumption of spot copper in China is restrained by high prices, and the consumer demand season before the festival has not been shown. The spot discount is maintained between 200-350 yuan, which suppresses the market's popularity to make more people. The price of copper will continue to maintain the pattern of strong outside and weak inside, and will passively follow the trend of foreign plates. It is expected that Shanghai copper will mainly be in a high position in the near future, and be cautious in holding long positions. [Full text] Corn Today, the domestic corn market fell back after hitting a new high. Although the soybean market rose sharply, it still failed to effectively bring up the corn futures price. When the corn spot supply was stable, most funds turned to other varieties with larger volatility. At present, the corn price in Dalian Port is 2060-2070 yuan / ton, with a moisture of 14%. The price of new corn in Heilongjiang Province arriving at the port is around 2020 yuan / ton, and the price of corn in Jinzhou Port is around 2070 yuan / ton. The market is still light. The price of new corn in Guangdong Port of good quality is 2160-2180 yuan / ton, and the price of old corn is 2180-2200 yuan / ton. The port corn of good quality in the port has a fast delivery speed, and the port corn inventory is about 230000 tons. In recent days, the prices of starch and corn oil in China have continued to decline, and the downstream demand is not booming, which does not support the rise of corn prices. Deep processing enterprises may have a small adjustment in the acquisition price under the pressure of profit decline. In addition, the Spring Festival is coming soon. Farmers generally have a peak grain selling period at the beginning of the year, and the supply of corn will increase. However, the main force of the earlier corn market acquisition was deep processing and China's top enterprises. The general trade has not been competitive. In the case of declining deep processing profits and China's top enterprises being restricted, traders may seize this grain selling opportunity to replenish the warehouse, which will limit the downside space of corn. In general, the corn market will still maintain the trend of range consolidation, and the range of fluctuations is 2310-2360. Investors can carry out band operations, with the two ends of the range as stop loss. [Full text] Fuel oil The US December private employment data released on Wednesday was unexpectedly stronger than expected, boosting market sentiment. AutomaticDataProcessingInc. (ADP), a human resources service company, and the consulting firm MacroeconomicAdvisers's national employment report showed that the number of private sector employees in the United States increased by 297000 in December. Economists had previously expected that ADP would announce an increase of 100000 people in December. The weekly inventory report published by the US Energy Data Association (EIA) on Wednesday showed that the US crude oil inventory decreased by 4.16 million barrels to 335.27 million barrels in the week ending December 31, with an estimated decrease of 1.8 million barrels. On Wednesday, the private sector employment figures released in the United States were better than expected, and the decline of crude oil inventories announced by the EIA also exceeded market expectations. The above fundamental factors hedged the adverse impact of the rise of the US dollar, boosting crude oil prices to rise and recovering the US$90 pass; In terms of Shanghai oil, due to the recent low demand, the price has been fluctuating at a low level, but there is some support near 4900, and the established long list can continue to be held. [Full text] Early rice From the recent performance of the spot market, the粳rice purchase price in the North and North China regions is steadily rising, and the late rice purchase price in the Jiangnan region is relatively stable with a slight increase. At present, the early rice market is in a light period, and the trade volume in the market is insufficient. With the arrival of the peak consumption period of the Spring Festival, the market rice price is expected to further rise. At present, the overall rising trend of the international agricultural product market is intact, and the grain market has found a new theme to support, which is expected to make CBOT agricultural product futures prices further rise. The domestic grain market is also driven. Early rice is under policy pressure, and the current upward trend is still relatively slow. However, it will still continue to fluctuate and rise. From the performance in the market, we can see that the recent early rice market needs the cooperation of the surrounding atmosphere. In the absence of effective support, the fund's attention is relatively insufficient. Therefore, it is suggested to operate less and less, or to lay a small number of phased long orders at a low level. [Full text] Gold The ISM non manufacturing index and ADP employment figures released overnight in the United States were better than expected, boosting the dollar index to rise sharply. The US non agricultural employment report for December will be released on Friday, which may further guide gold. Looking back, when the unemployment rate in the United States in November was as high as 9.8% far worse than expected on December 3, gold rose by 28 dollars on the same day, but a series of recent data shows that the US economy has warmed up, so the non agricultural employment report to be published tomorrow is critical. In the short term, gold may have some rebound after a big fall, but it is restricted by the strength of the US dollar index. It is expected that the rebound will be limited, with a pressure of US $1390 above and a support of US $1365 below. [Full text]

燕西台西山果岭名门专家品鉴会(组图)(2)图为中国房地产及住宅研究会副会长顾云昌发言【范越】：首先感谢蔡总组织这个活动，燕西台我已经先来过两次，也看过这里的环境，对这片很熟悉，原来爬香山，去颐和园都是春游的时候小学的时候学校组织的，感觉也是独特的。我打高尔夫也是做了18年了，现在北京市打球的接近8万人，打球的人口，我和陈总也是好朋友，打球人口的增长和我们刚才顾总说的房地产的发展，我认为中国的经济不断的发展，确实给人们的生活水平提高带来了很快的机会。【范越】：就这块来说，在北京来说应该是独一无二的，虽然现在是9个洞的高尔夫球场，但是已经和社区形成了地产、别墅、高尔夫的结合，这个结合实际上刚才顾老已经说了，在国际上也就是这个硬件了，但是从软件上，高尔夫的文化来说，别墅、社区，包括生活的环境来讲，刚才我们聊天，陈总也说了，很多人喜欢爬山，我也认识很多的老同志喜欢爬山，大家认为剧烈的运动是好的运动，实际上高尔夫运动在三十岁、四十岁甚至更高的年龄可以推荐的运动，你可以从五岁运动到九十五岁，这个跨度非常大。【范越】：这么好的别墅两口人住应该还是很浪费的，一个好的社区应该是老人、孩子，最好是三代享受别墅的生活，实际上高尔夫为什么在中国理解不是很多，在国外很成熟的非常好的体育产业，特别是这个年代有老虎伍兹这么好的球员带动了这个产业。我去国外最大的体会是刷完油漆就可以去打球，普通的工人都可以去打球，这种社区如果一家生活在这里，孩子，甚至爷爷和孙子都可以享受这个生活，一起打球，这个在国外是很常见的，一家三口，我在美国打球的时候就遇到一个父亲和女儿、女婿，我和他们聊，他说我们家就在这里，出口就可以打球，这个社区球场还有一个好的东西，我们也提一个建议，像陈总这样的，就把物业费融进去了，打球就不花钱了。【范越】：我在洛杉矶考察了一个老年社区，这个还是高品质的球场，他们的球场比这个短，大概五千码，像年龄大的，短杆很短，像这样的社区在北京是没有的，因为抬头可以看到山，想爬山就可以爬山，想打球就可以打球，这个文化高尔夫渗透，因为高尔夫享受生活的概念在哪？最大的概念是调整自己的心态享受生活，而不是完全靠竞争，对抗，因为很多人在每天大量的脑力劳动以后需要放松，高尔夫最好的放松就是把自己的身体和心里做一个调整，年龄跨度，现在退下来很多的领导都开始享受高尔夫的快乐。【范越】：上个月我在日本体会到，现在有六七十个老年人打球然后晚上一起吃饭，享受这个生活，在中国还看不到这个场面，但是我觉得像陈总和我，再过二十年就是享受高尔夫的生活，享受这个优秀的社区、房产和高尔夫的结合，我觉得这是一个潮流，这是一个趋势，但是这个位置在北京已经没有了，如果说这个位置放在上海，就不得了了，因为北京还是和上海的房子便宜很多，我们从国际化来说，我也支持蔡总，我们去年就搞过这些论坛，特别是房山、西部这块，我们看到生活水平不可能下降，只是短期的时候遇到一些危机，就像人遇到一些身体上的不适等等，但是无论如何社区是往前走的，生活的水平不断的提高，这种前瞻性和预见性，作为投资者、房地产商也好，还是要站在一个高度去看房地产的发展。【范越】：我为什么讲高尔夫文化，我们在非典的时候也出过效果，在广东后一组的人打到前面的人前面了，结果很多人要打起来的，如果我想陈总和蔡总是邻居，一句话就不会造成更多的笑话，高尔夫在中国，因为有了好的社区的平台，大家在楼房里面互相都不认识，也是一种很尴尬的生活状态，在国外非常的友好，非常的友善，因为高尔夫的规格，礼节礼貌大家都知道，更高的境界是要为他人着想，所以我想从文化和精神上来讲，高尔夫还有很多的推广的东西，打球的孩子不容易学坏，打高尔夫有一个境界和追求的目标，很多精力放在打球上，老虎伍兹也免费给美国办了一个高尔夫学院，包括中国有NBA的篮球姚明，更多人喜欢NBA一样，燕西台虽然低调，但是也慢慢的看到了果岭名门，也是挺有特色的，所以我希望我们的社区越做越好，给北京的高尔夫文化和住宅文化提供好的平台和交流的机会。【主持人】：谢谢范总，刚才也是给你们提了一个意见，太低调也不好，我要是早一点知道这个项目，我在房子的时候就会考虑，以前还真是不知道，今天我也是第一次上项目现场来，您打球，知道球场的信息比我们快，我们还是想象从房产，要是两年前动的时候，两年前我们想，是什么价格，但是有球场的信息，当时就不是不知道这个信息的情况，就会失去一些置业者的机会。【主持人】：刚才您说的关于国外的发展趋势，像欧美的发达国家，他们的今天就是我们的未来，我们几年之后，甚至我们现在很多的方面都超越他们的，我前天中午跟一个做金融的，原来在政府部门工作的朋友谈一个事儿，我们整个过程当中就听他讲了，他现在鼓动身边的人一定要去找到好的，比如说教育、球场、医院这样好地段的房子去买，因为现在从整个大的经济形势来看，现在还是通缩，但是从全球的经济形势来看，所有的西方国家，包括我们国家的政府救市采取的举措来看，下半年肯定要进入通胀期，整个的物价指数，什么最保险，房产的投资从现在的市场，我们已经看出来了，大量的投资客已经开始进入到市场里面了，我们私下聊天他说一定要找好资源的物业拿着，未来一两年，通胀他预测今年年底会达到两位数，我觉得政府也是要综合考虑的。从改革开放到现在来说，经常是走两端的形势上的问题，以前毕竟我们缺乏很多的经验和手段，特别是房地产市场发展，我们和陈秘书长聊的时候，也一直担心，要救市，但是也不能过头，导致房价暴涨，这是政府担心的，但是整体的形势就在这里，不是中国在救市，欧美都在救市，美国大量的印钞票，对政府的消费刺激和带动作用还是有很高的影响，很多人预期在明年下半年一定会有很明显的显现，在这个时候，我想可能对于老百姓置业投资角度来说，理财都是需要密切关注的。图为北京房地产协会副秘书长陈志【主持人】：陈秘书长，您对北京的市场也很了解了，也请您谈谈对这个方面的看法。【陈志】：随便说说，因为顾老师在这里了，是高尔夫的前辈，我没有打过高尔夫，我踢足球，现在很多的朋友都被拉到高尔夫里面来了，足球是年轻人的运动。今天很高兴来到燕西台这个项目，一看环境非常好。刚才顾老师也说了，蔡总也说了房地产的一些情况，实际上说到一个信贷的问题。我昨天下午跟北京市银行协会交流，我们也聊到有关信贷方面的问题，从全国来说，一季度4.58万亿的信贷规模，觉得挺吓人的，全年的指标是5万亿，这才一季度，我们感觉到为了救市，一季度信贷的迅速膨胀，刚才像蔡总说的就有一个担心，这么大的资金下去了之后，会不会迅速的造成了大规模的通胀，甚至是不可控制的，我在跟银行协会的同志聊的时候得到一个信息，现在60%以上的规模还是在票据间，没有进入到实体经济当中，但是这么大量的钱，撰起来以后，怎么样把真正缺钱的，把资金用在实体经济当中，我们也在想，在今年的下半年，为银行企业，为我们的金融机构推出一个真正能够客观、评价我们房地产企业的信用的体系出来，这个我们昨天跟银行协会，谈的非常的愉快，也初步达成了一个意向，这个是我们下半年要做的一项事情，就是能够真正的把房地产企业和银行企业通过一种评价，让银行企业更多的认识到我们企业的价值。【陈志】：说到投资，刚才顾老师说了一个基本的概念，就是房子过五十年，六十年，他的生命周期就结束了，但是他的经济周期还没有结束，土地在不断的增值，作为投资角度来说，我想更多的是看到稀缺资源，特别稀缺地段的资源带来的投资，北京我们讲国际大都市的地位，政治、经济、文化的中心，特别是北京这样一个总部经济的汇聚的城市，这是一个非常特殊的，而且具有非常明显的窗口效应和示范效应，这个是我们全中国其他城市不可替代的资源，在这样的城市当中，我们还有这么好的一个项目，占有了这么大的稀缺资源，像我们讲的地铁上盖的，城市干线上的房产，只要地铁一通，价格就涨起来，从这个角度来看我们燕西台这个项目，从投资来说，我个人认为是没有问题的，应该是随着经济的发展，随着国际化、城市化的推进，这种资源会越来越少，作为稀缺资源，刚才范秘书长说了，包括教育、对人的性格的陶冶等等都有很多的作用，对经济也是一种拉动，所以我想这样的项目，不可能太多，因为他稀缺，不可能太多，我觉得应该是值得珍藏的产品。	顾老师,范越,顾云昌,主持人,陈志,陈总,蔡总	正向	Yanxitai Xishan Golf Green Famous Experts Tasting Seminar (picture group) (2) Figure Vice President Gu Yunchang of China Real Estate and Housing Research Association [Fan Yue]: First of all, I would like to thank President Cai for organizing this activity. I have been to Yanxitai twice, and I have also seen the environment here. I am very familiar with this place. Originally, climbing Xiangshan and going to the Summer Palace were organized by the school during spring outing when I was in elementary school, and I also feel unique. I have also played golf for 18 years. Now there are nearly 80000 people in Beijing who play golf. I am also good friends with President Chen. I think the growth of people who play golf and the real estate development just mentioned by President Gu are the two things. I think China's economy is developing continuously, which really brings people a lot of opportunities to improve their living standards. 【 Fan Yue 】: As far as this piece is concerned, it should be unique in Beijing. Although it is a nine hole golf course now, it has formed a combination of real estate, villas and golf with the community. In fact, the combination has already been mentioned by the old man Gu. Internationally, it is also this hardware. However, in terms of software, golf culture, villas, communities, and even the living environment, just now, we chatted, President Chen also said that many people like mountain climbing. I also know many old comrades who like mountain climbing. Everyone thinks that intense exercise is good exercise. In fact, golf can be recommended as an exercise at the age of 30, 40 or even higher. You can exercise from 5 years old to 95 years old, which is a very large span. 【 Fan Yue 】: It is still a waste for two people to live in such a good villa. A good community should be old people, children, and the best three generations to enjoy the villa life. In fact, the reason why golf is not well understood in China is that it is a very mature and excellent sports industry abroad, especially in this era, there are so many good players as Tiger Woods to promote this industry. My biggest experience in going abroad is that I can go to play golf after painting. Ordinary workers can go to play golf. If a family lives in this community, children, and even grandfathers and grandsons can enjoy this life and play together. This is very common abroad. A family of three, when I played golf in the United States, I met a father, a daughter and a son-in-law. I chatted with them. He said that our family is here. We can play golf at the exit. This community golf course also has a good thing. We also made a suggestion. Like President Chen, we should integrate the property management fee, and then we don't have to spend money to play golf. 【 Fan Yue 】: I examined an old community in Los Angeles. This is still a high-quality golf course. Their golf course is shorter than this one. It is about 5000 yards long. If you are old, the short stick is very short. There is no such community in Beijing, because you can see the mountain when you look up, climb the mountain if you want, and play golf if you want. Golf culture permeates. Where is the concept of enjoying life with golf? The biggest concept is to adjust our mentality to enjoy life, rather than rely entirely on competition and confrontation, because many people need to relax after a lot of mental labor every day. The best way to relax in golf is to adjust our body and mind. The span of age is very large. Now that many leaders have retired, they have begun to enjoy the happiness of golf. 【 Fan Yue 】: Last month, I experienced in Japan that there are sixty or seventy elderly people playing golf and then having dinner together to enjoy this life. We can't see this scene in China, but I think that in twenty years, President Chen and I will enjoy the life of golf, enjoy the combination of this excellent community, real estate and golf. I think this is a trend, but this position is no longer available in Beijing. If this position is in Shanghai, it will be amazing, because Beijing is still much cheaper than Shanghai in terms of houses. In terms of internationalization, I also support President Cai. We have conducted these forums since last year, especially in Foshan and the western part. We saw that the living standard is impossible to decline. It is just that we encounter some crises in the short term, such as physical discomfort and so on. However, in any case, the community is moving forward and the living standard is constantly improving. This forward-looking and predictive nature, as an investor or a real estate developer, should also stand at a height to look at the development of real estate. 【 Fan Yue 】: Why do I talk about golf culture? We also made some achievements during the non popular period. The second group of people in Guangdong played ahead of the first group. As a result, many people want to fight. If I think President Chen and President Cai are neighbors, one sentence will not cause more jokes. Golf in China, because of the good community platform, everyone in the building do not know each other, is also an embarrassing living state. Abroad, it is very friendly and friendly, because everyone knows the specifications, etiquette and politeness of golf. The higher level is to think for others. So I think, in terms of culture and spirit, golf has a lot to promote. It is not easy for children to play golf to learn bad. Playing golf has a realm and goal to pursue. A lot of energy is spent on playing golf. Tiger Woods also gave the United States a free golf college, including Yao Ming, a basketball player in China's NBA, like more people who like the NBA. Although Yanxitai is low-key, it has slowly seen the green gate, which is also very distinctive. I hope our community will get better and better, and provide a good platform and opportunity for exchanges for Beijing's golf culture and residential culture. 【 Host 】: Thank you, President Fan. Just now, I also gave you a suggestion that being too low-key is not good. If I had known this project earlier, I would consider it when I was in a house. I really didn't know it before. Today, I also came to the project site for the first time. You play golf and know the information of the golf course faster than we do. We still imagine that from the real estate, if we moved two years ago, we thought about the price two years ago. However, with the information of the golf course, we did not know the information at that time, and we will lose some opportunities for real estate investment. 【 Host 】: What you just said about the development trend abroad, such as developed countries in Europe and America, their today is our future. In a few years, or even now, many aspects of our country have exceeded them. I had lunch with a friend who works in the government yesterday中午. We just listened to him talk about it throughout the process. He is now encouraging people around him to find good houses, such as education, golf courses, hospitals and other good locations to buy, because now, from the perspective of the whole macroeconomic situation, it is still deflationary. But looking at the global economic situation, all Western countries, including the government's rescue measures in our country, will definitely enter the inflation period in the second half of the year, and the overall price index. What is the most secure? From the current market, we have seen that a large number of investors have begun to enter the market. When we chat in private, he said that we must find a good property resource to hold it. In the future, one or two years, the inflation he predicts will reach double digits by the end of this year, I think the government also needs to take a comprehensive consideration. From the reform and opening up to now, there are often problems at the end of the situation. After all, we lack many experiences and means, especially the development of the real estate market. When we chat with Secretary Chen, we are always worried that we want to save the market, but we can't go too far, which will lead to a sharp rise in house prices. This is what the government is worried about. However, the overall situation is here, not in China, but in Europe and the United States, which are also saving the market. The United States has printed a large number of banknotes, which has a high impact on the government's consumption stimulation and promotion. Many people expect that there will be a significant manifestation in the second half of next year. At this time, I think it may be necessary for ordinary people to pay close attention to investment in real estate from the perspective of investment in real estate. Chen Zhizhi, Deputy Secretary General of Beijing Real Estate Association 【 Host 】: Secretary General Chen, you are also very familiar with the Beijing market, and I would like to invite you to talk about your views on this aspect. 【 Chen Zhizhi 】: Just talk about it. Because Professor Gu is here, he is a veteran of golf. I have never played golf. I play football. Now many friends are being pulled into golf. Football is a sport for young people. Today, I am very happy to come to the Yansi Platform project. When I look at the environment, it is very good. Just now, Professor Cai and President Cai also talked about some situations of real estate, and in fact, they talked about a credit problem. Yesterday afternoon, I exchanged views with the Bankers Association of Beijing, and we also talked about the credit problem. From a national perspective, the credit scale of 4.58 trillion in the first quarter was scary. The annual index was 5 trillion, and it
威廉姆斯学雷锋让出先发主帅：他是一个善良的人新浪体育讯　北京时间10月23日消息，据nj.com报道，周二篮网尼克斯赛前教练劳伦斯-弗兰克征询希恩-威廉姆斯意见，为他要不要先发，结果威廉姆斯居然严词拒绝了弗兰克的好意。当然弗兰克也没有就因此惊诧莫名用看外星人或者傻瓜一样的眼神去鄙视威廉姆斯，质疑他的进取心。篮网教练只是耸耸肩一笑而过，因为他太了解威廉姆斯。“他是非常非常真诚的让出了主力位置，”弗兰克说，“我不觉得这很诡异，他就是这样的人。希恩是一个团队至上的球员，他不是一个自私的家伙，他心地很善良的，他就是由衷的感到应该给布鲁克一个先发的机会。”不过弗兰克的辩解还是没法掩盖实质问题，威廉姆斯到底有没有心思去争夺主力中锋的位置？如果有，他为什么在这种需要更多出场时间刷更好数据证明自己的时候退缩？篮网主力中锋之争威廉姆斯已然落在洛佩斯和约什-布恩之后，此时还不奋起却学人做雷锋，到底是什么心态？威廉姆斯不是号称训练营头两周篮网No.1吗？“哥们，我知道自己能做什么，”威廉姆斯说，“球队的每个人也都知道我的能力，现在是训练营时间，教练只是去做他必须做的事情好让所有人都为新赛季做好准备。我能做的就是每天刻苦训练为新赛季机会的到来做好准备，懂了吗？”5场季前赛威廉姆斯只打了89分钟，而洛佩斯出场时间是139分钟，事实上威廉姆斯也没有充分展示自己的能力，他依然活力十足，但这却没能转化成实实在在的数据或者对比赛的影响力。“Ah，我确实有点在倒退，”威廉姆斯说，“我只是努力想回到正轨，在场上的时候尽量跑到正确的位置，去做正确的事情，进一步提高自己。我对自己的能力非常有信心，这只是季前赛而已，这些比赛不算数的，我只是想充分享受打球的乐趣，找到团队合作的感觉。全队都在努力变得更好，现在队里有不少伤兵，又有很多新球员加盟，现在只是培养团队默契的阶段，明白我的意思吗？”威廉姆斯的新赛季前景看上去愈发不够明朗，他没有得到多少打大前锋的机会，这影响了他的出场时间。而且威廉姆斯进攻一般、低位有待打磨。不过弗兰克担心的倒不是威廉姆斯的数据，而是他的表现还不够稳定。“希恩必须要做那种改变局势的人，活力四射的球员，在场上积极奔跑寻找轻松得分的机会，冲抢前场篮板保护禁区，”教练说道，“这些东西现在必须要成为他在联盟的标志、特征。”(加缪)	洛佩斯,加缪,布鲁克,布恩,希恩,雷锋,劳伦斯-弗兰克,弗兰克,威廉姆斯	正向	"Williams learned from Lei Feng to give up the head coach: He is a kind person Sina Sports News On October 23, Beijing time, according to nj.com, Lawrence Frank, the coach before the Nets Knicks game on Tuesday, asked Sean Williams for advice on whether he should start or not. As a result, Williams actually refused Frank's kindness in a severe way. Of course, Frank didn't despise Williams with the eyes of aliens or fools because of this inexplicable shock, and questioned his ambition. The Nets coach just shrugged his shoulders and smiled, because he knew Williams too well. ""He gave up his main position very, very sincerely,"" said Frank. ""I don't think it's weird. He's just like that. Sean is a team first player. He is not a selfish guy. He is very kind. He sincerely feels that Brook should be given a chance to start first."" However, Frank's defense still failed to cover up the substantive problem. Did Williams have any intention to compete for the position of the main center? If so, why did he retreat at this time when he needed more playing time to brush better data to prove himself? Williams has fallen behind Lopez and Josh Boone in the battle for the Nets' main center. At this time, he is learning to be a model of Lei Feng. What is the mentality? Is Williams the No. 1 of the Nets in the first two weeks of the training camp? ""Dude, I know what I can do,"" said Williams. ""Everyone in the team also knows my ability. Now is the time of training camp. The coach just did what he had to do to get everyone ready for the new season. What I can do is to prepare for the coming opportunity of the new season by training hard every day. Understand?"" Williams only played 89 minutes in five preseason games, while Lopez played 139 minutes. In fact, Williams did not fully demonstrate his ability. He was still energetic, but it did not translate into concrete data or influence on the game. ""Ah, I was really retrogressing,"" said Williams. ""I just tried to get back on track, try to run to the right position and do the right thing when I was on the court, and further improve myself. I have great confidence in my ability. This is just a preseason game, and these games don't count. I just want to enjoy the fun of playing and find the feeling of team cooperation. The whole team is trying to get better. Now there are many wounded soldiers in the team and many new players have joined. Now is just the stage of cultivating team cooperation. Do you understand my meaning?"" Williams' prospects for the new season seem increasingly unclear, and he has not got much chance to play power forwards, which has affected his playing time. Moreover, Williams' offense is generally low and needs to be polished. However, what Frank is worried about is not Williams' data, but his performance is not stable enough.

Sina does not guarantee its truthfulness and objectivity. All effective information about the stock is subject to the announcement of Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Please pay attention to the risk. Will Shanghai Airport inject it into the overall listing before the expansion of Hongqiao Airport is completed? Peng Yang, an intern reporter of the Financial Weekly, wrote that 1+1<1. When will this situation occur? It often happens in Shanghai. The most typical case is that since the Shanghai Pudong Airport was put into use in 2000, Shanghai has had a similar ""one city and two venues"" model with Incheon and Gimpo airports in Seoul, South Korea, and Narita and Haneda airports in Tokyo, Japan, but in 9 years, the result is that the market share of the two airports in the Yangtze River Delta has dropped from 78% to 70%. Moreover, if the much concerned Hongqiao Airport expansion project is expected to be completed by the end of 2009 and试operation in March 2010, the weak attraction of Shanghai Airport's listed assets, Pudong Airport, will be worse. Then, taking advantage of the surging tide of Shanghai's restructuring, will Shanghai Airport (600009. SH) inject it into the overall listing before the expansion of Hongqiao Airport is completed? The industry believes that it is not far from the end of the settlement. ""The catalyst for asset injection is approaching"" The recent market rumors are getting more and more serious. However, securities companies have begun to write reports recommending Shanghai Airport密集, such as Shenwan said: ""Shanghai Airport has entered the rapid growth period, and its long-term hub position has been strengthened. Hongqiao Phase II will be put into operation in March next year, and the catalyst for asset injection is coming, and it will be upgraded to buy rating"". Wei Qiang, an analyst of UBS Securities, believes that ""the assets of Hongqiao Airport are likely to be injected into Shanghai Airport before March 2010"". As early as the shareholders' meeting of Shanghai Airport on June 26, Yu Wuyan, Chairman of Shanghai Airport, made an emergency statement that ""the integration of Pudong Airport and Hongqiao Airport is inevitable, but there is no specific timetable at present"". The reporter called the staff of the office of Shanghai Airport for this matter, and the reply was that ""the company is currently studying the specific integration plan, and there is no specific timetable"". ""The internal integration of the two airports has basically no problems. At present, the key is to wait for the government to make a decision."" According to an securities analyst close to Shanghai Airport, ""In fact, as early as 2003, when the two airports reached an asset exchange agreement, they had prepared for the overall listing of Shanghai Airport Group."" As early as after the approval of the expansion plan of Hongqiao Airport in 2007, Jia Ruijun, the general manager of Shanghai Airport Group, expressed the logic of the above analysts. It seems that the management has a strong motivation to promote the overall listing of Shanghai Airport. The expansion project of Hongqiao Phase II has been completed, and the terminal building structure has been closed. It will be put into use in March 2010. The above-mentioned securities analysts believe that ""It is likely that the assets of Hongqiao Airport will be injected into Shanghai Airport before the completion of Hongqiao Phase II in March next year, which will not violate the commitment made at the beginning of asset injection and share reform"". Shenwan's latest research report said that Shanghai Airport may take over Hongqiao Phase II in two ways: one is to inject mature assets such as Hongqiao Phase I into the listed company at the same time; The second is that the listed company leases and uses the assets of Hongqiao Phase II, and then acquires them from the group through financing in the future. ""Increase 2009 performance by 25%"" The rapid growth period of domestic passenger traffic, the recovery of international passenger traffic, the successful restructuring of Dongfang Airlines and Shanghang, and the proximity of the Expo have undoubtedly injected a catalyst into the integration plan of Shanghai Airport. In 2008, the international and regional航线passengers of the two airports in Shanghai reached 16.48 million, which was significantly higher than the Capital International Airport and the Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou. In addition, the 2010 Expo will bring 6.2 million new passengers to Shanghai, with a growth rate of 12% in new passenger throughput. At present, the main source of income of Shanghai Airport is aviation income, including flight take-off and landing fees, passenger port service fees, ground service fees, etc., while non aviation income only accounts for 30%, and non aviation development is not sufficient. However, with the implementation of the commercial development plan of Pudong Airport, there will be a lot of room for future development in the field of non navigation revenue. According to Shenwan's calculation, the injection of mature assets such as Hongqiao Phase I and cargo stations will increase the performance by 25% in 2009 and 10% - 15% in 2010. The capital expenditure of 15 billion yuan for the second phase of Hongqiao may be operated in a one-time injection or lease, which will have a negative impact on the short-term performance of Shanghai Airport. In this regard, the above-mentioned UBS analyst believes that ""the rational coordination of the management of the two major airports in Shanghai will benefit minority shareholders""."

经纪人确认中国前锋近期签葡超伤病令他彻底无缘备战新浪体育讯　如果没有随国奥队参加夏季的一系列热身赛事，效力于葡超升班马贝拉马尔的前锋王刚本来可以在家中度过一个愉快的暑假，而现在，他也应该早已回到葡萄牙，随队在外地进行一系列的备战以及比赛。然而一心穿上国字号球衣的王刚却在夏天的比赛中遭遇了伤病的意外，这次伤病不仅让他基本无缘贝拉马尔赛季前的备战训练营，甚至葡萄牙媒体称，这将有可能影响到他最终与贝拉马尔签订新赛季的工作合同。尽管在接受了核磁共振的检查后王刚的伤势并无大碍，但在回到葡萄牙的前几天，心情不太好的王刚仍然选择了独处。20日，是之前王刚说要回到葡萄牙阿威罗的日子。但根据他的经纪人透露，他并未直接与贝拉马尔汇合，而是将在阿威罗独自进行恢复，这也意味着，王刚很可能将错过葡超赛季前的整个备战期。不过经纪人稍后给出了一个让人欣慰一些的消息，那就是王刚的伤情没有葡萄牙媒体说的这么严重，并且不会影响到他新赛季征战葡超。他透露，在贝拉马尔结束夏训营返回阿威罗后，王刚将与球队正式签订新赛季的工作合同。另外针对于记者所关心的“王刚11月是否会回国参加亚运会”的问题，经纪人也给出了解释：“现在王刚的身体情况还没法最后的确定，还要看他伤势恢复的情况，但如果一切顺利的话，他仍然将参加在广州举行的亚运会足球赛。”(孟晓雨)	孟晓雨,王刚	正向	"The agent confirmed that the recent signing of the Portuguese Super Injury by the Chinese forward made him completely unprepared for the Sina Sports News. If he had not joined the national Olympic team to participate in a series of warm-up events in summer, Wang Gang, the forward who played for the Portuguese Super提拔horse Belamar, would have spent a pleasant summer holiday at home, and now, he should have returned to Portugal to prepare and play with the team. However, Wang Gang, who was determined to wear the national team's jersey, suffered an unexpected injury in the summer game. This injury not only made him almost无缘to the pre season training camp of Belamar, but the Portuguese media even said that it could affect his signing of the new season's work contract with Belamar. Although Wang Gang's injury was not serious after he received a magnetic resonance examination, he still chose to be alone a few days before he returned to Portugal. On the 20th, it was the day when Wang Gang said he would return to Aveiro, Portugal. But according to his agent, he did not directly join Belamar, but he will recover alone in Aviero, which means that Wang Gang is likely to miss the whole preparation period before the Portuguese Super Season. However, the agent later gave a piece of good news, that is, Wang Gang's injury was not as serious as the Portuguese media said, and it would not affect his new season's campaign in the Portuguese Super League. He revealed that after Belamar ended the summer training camp and returned to Aweiluo, Wang Gang would officially sign a new season's work contract with the team. In addition, the agent also gave an explanation to the journalist's concern about whether Wang Gang will return to China to participate in the Asian Games in November: ""Now Wang Gang's physical condition has not been finally determined, and it depends on the recovery of his injury, but if everything goes well, he will still participate in the Asian Games football tournament held in Guangzhou.""

上海证券：11月份PPI数据点评证券通PPI涨幅迅速回落超出市场预期11月份，工业品出厂价格指数同比增幅仅为2.0%，大大超出市场预期。生产资料出厂价格指数同比增幅继续快速回落，而生活资料出厂价格回落速度继续小于生产资料价格。CPI的回落幅度会继续小于PPI的回落幅度。原材料价格涨幅伴随国际大宗商品价格回落国内原材料、燃料、动力价格与国际大宗商品价格走势具有较强的趋同性，由于“订单效应”的滞后影响，国内的价格一般要滞后国际价格2-3个月。在国际市场大宗商品价格未现回暖迹象的情况下，后期国内的原材料价格指数还会延续下降的态势。关注PPI关注工业企业收入对于工业企业来讲，原材料价格涨幅回落应该是好消息，因为企业的生产成本会逐渐下降。但与此同时，作为收入来源的工业品出厂价格涨幅的快速下滑则导致工业企业的经营状况前景堪忧。PPI是工业企业收入的Granger原因，即工业品出厂价格的变化是工业企业收入变化的原因。在关注原材料下降的同时，我们更要关注PPI下降带给工业企业的不利影响。下一交易日大盘走势判断您目前的仓位		正向	"Shanghai Stock Exchange: In November, the PPI data commented that the securities通PPI rose rapidly, which fell back beyond market expectations. In November, the year-on-year growth rate of the factory price index of industrial products was only 2.0%, far exceeding market expectations. The year-on-year growth rate of production data factory price index continued to decline rapidly, while the factory price of living goods continued to decline less than that of production data price. The decline of CPI will continue to be less than that of PPI. The increase of raw material prices accompanied by the decline of international commodity prices, the domestic raw material, fuel and power prices have strong convergence with the international commodity prices. Due to the lag effect of ""order effect"", the domestic prices generally lag behind the international prices by 2-3 months. In the case of no sign of warming in the international market of commodity prices, the later raw material price index in China will continue to decline. Pay attention to PPI and pay attention to the income of industrial enterprises. For industrial enterprises, the retreat of raw material price increases should be good news, because the production costs of enterprises will gradually decrease. However, at the same time, the rapid decline of the increase in the factory price of industrial products, which is the source of income, leads to worrying prospects for the operation of industrial enterprises. PPI is the Granger cause of the income of industrial enterprises, that is, the change of the factory price of industrial products is the cause of the change of the income of industrial enterprises. While paying attention to the decline of raw materials, we should pay more attention to the adverse effects of the decline of PPI on industrial enterprises.

中兴两个月完成印GSM网800站点商用【通信产业网讯】(通文)两个月内完成800个站点的商用，平均每月快速建设400个站，AircelGSM网络项目一系列的超常规成绩，正是中兴通讯积极响应、深入客户、深入基层等各种有效措施的结果，得以对实践中遇到的困难迎刃而解。与中国毗邻的印度位于南亚次大陆，面积约298万平方公里，人口11.66亿。印度经济以传统耕种、现代农业、手工业、现代工业以及其他支撑产业为主。在印度，通信市场潜力巨大，同时，市场的开放性也吸引了众多运营商参与其中，竞争日益激烈。Aircel是东南亚地区新兴移动运营商Maxis集团在印度的控股子公司，其74%的股份由Maxis所有。目前，Aircel在印度共拥有1960万用户，作为印度领先的移动网络服务商，Aircel提供的服务已经覆盖印度10个邦，目前正计划覆盖全印度，Aircel将宏伟目标的起步首先定位于提升GSM网络质量、扩容GSM网络规模。2个月商用800个站2008年10月10日，跨国运营商Maxis与中兴通讯签订GSM网络承建合同，中兴通讯将为Maxis在印度的控股子公司Aircel建设GSM网络。AircelGSM项目是综合全TurnkeyGSM网络建设，中兴通讯将提供MSCserver、MGW、iBSC、5000多个站点，以及配套的微波、电源和站点基建部分，并负责所有站点规划、网络优化以及为期三年的网络运维。让Aircel意想不到的是本次GSM网络建设超常规的高效率，中兴通讯在两个月内即完成了800个站点的商用，其中包括300个全TK站点。2009年10月31日，网络建设已实现3203个站点完成安装，开通3163个站点，验收1611个站点。印度Aircel全TurnkeyGSM项目，平均每月快速建设400个站，包括35%的Turnkey站点的快速交付，一系列突出业绩来自于中兴通讯对中方和本地人力资源的良好管理、区域优势的有效发挥、充分的跨文化沟通和交流，以及对外包合作伙伴的技能培训和技术转移。		正向	ZTE completed the printing of 800 sites in two months【 Communication Industry News】(Communication Wen)Completed 800 sites in two months for commercial use, averaging 400 stations per month, a series of unconventional achievements of the AircelGSM network project, which was exactly the result of ZTE's positive response, in-depth customers, in-depth grassroots and other effective measures, to solve the difficulties encountered in practice. India, which borders on China, is located in the South Asian subcontinent, with an area of about 2.98 million square kilometers and a population of 1.166 billion. The Indian economy is mainly based on traditional farming, modern agriculture, handicrafts, modern industry and other supporting industries. In India, the communication market has huge potential. At the same time, the openness of the market has also attracted many operators to participate in it, and the competition is becoming increasingly fierce. Aircel is a holding subsidiary of Maxis Group, a new mobile operator in Southeast Asia, in India, 74% of which is owned by Maxis. At present, Aircel has a total of 19.6 million users in India. As a leading mobile network service provider in India, the service provided by Aircel has covered 10 states in India. At present, it is planned to cover all India. Aircel will first focus on improving the quality of GSM network and expanding the scale of GSM network to start the ambitious goal. On October 10, 2008, the multinational operator Maxis signed a GSM network construction contract with ZTE, and ZTE will build a GSM network for Aircel, a holding subsidiary of Maxis in India. AircelGSM project is a comprehensive turnkey GSM network construction. ZTE will provide MSCserver, MGW, iBSC, more than 5000 sites, as well as microwave, power supply and site infrastructure, and is responsible for site planning, network optimization and three-year network operation and maintenance. Unexpectedly, Aircel did not expect the unconventional high efficiency of this GSM network construction. ZTE completed the commercial use of 800 stations in two months, including 300 full TK stations. On October 31, 2009, the network construction had achieved 3203 installed sites, 3163 opened sites and 1611 accepted sites.

国米名将质疑里皮弃召米兰锋霸意大利一漏洞恐难挽回新浪体育讯　意大利成为了世界杯32强当中倒数第三个公布名单的国家，国家队23人名单公布，最终，西里古、科苏、卡萨尼、博列洛、G-罗西成为了最后的落选者。虽然此前的格罗索的落选引起了不小的震动，但起码争议并不是很大，但这次的五个落选者，却引来了不少的质疑。被质疑最多的是博列洛的落选，尽管名宿巴齐解释说：“里皮是想要一个和吉拉迪诺特点类似的替补，因此选择了帕奇尼，放弃了博列洛。”但前国际米兰球星贝卡罗西还是感到可惜：“我知道里皮倾向于吉拉迪诺，但我还是觉得，博列洛拥有一个优秀的赛季。”其实问题倒不是在于里皮的选择究竟是帕奇尼还是博列洛，而是博列洛和朱塞佩-罗西的确是两位有实力的球员，而他俩都落选之后，首先，意大利失去了一种强力中锋的打法，其次，迪纳塔莱唯一的替补没了。在前锋线上，意大利只有吉拉迪诺、帕奇尼、亚昆塔、迪纳塔莱、夸利亚雷拉五个人，的确有些过于单薄。而这其中，意大利媒体此前都预测锋线的落选者肯定会有夸利亚雷拉，而罗西和博列洛将“竞争”一个名额，结果里皮的选择令所有人感到意外。从里皮的选择来看，他还是希望以4-3-3主打，相比于罗西，夸利亚雷拉是一个真正的边锋，但里皮的首选一定还是亚昆塔和迪纳塔莱，一旦两人当中有一人出现伤停，里皮真的敢用状态平平的夸利亚雷拉么？如果这样，即便里皮人为排除了卡萨诺，但为何不选入巴洛特利呢？科苏的落选早在媒体的预料之中，但还是一件令人纠结的事情，一旦意大利需要变阵添一个前腰，目前唯一的人选就只剩下了卡莫拉内西，但相比于赛季助攻12球，并有一脚远射绝活的科苏，已经长起了小肚腩的卡莫拉内西的确是状态太差了，在经验和状态之间选择了前者，不知道里皮做出的是否是正确的选择。在后卫线上，卡萨尼的落选同样有一些疑问。目前，里皮仅拥有7名后卫，其中包括卡纳瓦罗、基耶利尼、博努奇、博凯蒂四名中后卫，马乔、克里西托、赞布罗塔三名边后卫，但三名边后卫中，马乔和克里西托在俱乐部分别打的是3-5-2和3-4-3阵型中的边卫，与4-4-2当中的边卫大相径庭，赞布罗塔的定位还是替补，就算里皮将基耶利尼移到了左路，但基耶利尼在俱乐部打左后卫时还是在卡佩罗执教尤文时代，而他打左后卫的水平比起其后来打中后卫差距很大，这样做，既削弱了基耶利尼，又削弱了意大利的中卫位置。而缺少一个真正的边后卫的问题，很可能将成为意大利在世界杯上一个无可挽回的漏洞。(沈飞)	卡佩罗,迪纳塔莱,马乔,巴洛特利,巴齐,亚昆塔,G-罗西,博凯蒂,贝卡罗西,夸利亚雷拉,朱塞佩-罗西,吉拉迪诺,卡萨诺,科苏,卡纳瓦罗,克里西托,基耶利尼,里皮,沈飞,博列洛,罗西,帕奇尼,卡莫拉内西,赞布罗塔,博努奇,西里古	负向	"The Inter Milan veteran questioned that Marcelo Lippi had abandoned the Milan sharpshooters, and Italy had a loophole that was hard to挽回Sina Sports News. Italy was the third country in the world to announce the list of 32 strongest teams. The list of 23 national team members was announced. Finally, Siliu, Cossu, Casani, Bolletto, G-Rossi became the last losers. Although the defeat of the previous Grosso caused considerable shock, the controversy was not very great. However, the five losers this time have caused a lot of doubts. The most questioned one is Bollelo's defeat. Although the veteran Bazi explained that ""Lippi wanted a substitute with the same characteristics as Gilardino, so he chose Pachini and abandoned Bollelo."" But the former Inter Milan star, Becarossi, still felt sorry: ""I know Lippi is in favor of Gilardino, but I still think Bollelo has an excellent season."" In fact, the problem is not that Lippi's choice is either Pachini or Bollelo, but Bollelo and Giuseppe Rossi are indeed two powerful players. After their two defeats, first of all, Italy lost a powerful center forward, and secondly, Di Natala's only substitute was gone. On the forward line, Italy only has five people, Giardino, Pachini, Aquafina, Di Natale and Quagliarella, which is really too thin. Among them, the Italian media previously predicted that the loser of the front line must be Quagliarella, and Rossi and Bollello will ""compete"" for a place. The result of Lippi's choice surprised everyone. From Lippi's choice, he still wants to play 4-3-3 as the main game. Compared with Rossi, Quagliarella is a real winger, but Lippi's first choice must still be Aquafina and Di Natale. Once one of them is injured, does Lippi really dare to use the mediocre Quagliarella? If so, even if Lippi excludes Cassano, why not choose Balotelli? Cossu's defeat has been expected by the media, but it is still a dilemma. Once Italy needs to change its formation to add a midfielder, there is only one candidate left, Camoranesi. However, compared with Cossu, who has 12 assists in the season and a long shot, Camoranesi, who has grown a small belly, is really in poor condition. I don't know if it is the right choice for Lippi to choose the former between experience and state. There are also some questions about the defeat of Cassani in the defensive line. At present, Lippi only has seven defenders, including four central defenders, Cannavaro, Chiellini, Bonucci, and Bochetti, and three full backs, Majue, Critto, and Zambrotta. However, among the three full backs, Majue and Critto play as full backs in the 3-5-2 and 3-4-3 formation of the club, which is quite different from the full back in the 4-4-2, and Zambrotta is still a substitute. Even if Lippi moves Chiellini to the left, Chiellini still plays as a left back in the club when Capello is coaching Juventus. However, his level of playing as a left back is far less than that of his later playing as a central defender. This will weaken Chiellini and Italy's central defender position. The lack of a real full back is likely to become an irretrievable loophole for Italy in the World Cup. (Shen Fei)"
50%唐正东究竟什么状态？每两分钟就能进1球抢1板新浪体育讯　北京时间10月29日消息，中国男篮在宁波北仑迎战亚运前的另一个热身对手美国明星队，最终中国队以92比64战胜了对手，取得了本次系列热身赛的首场胜利。唐正东本场比赛发挥出色，在出场13分钟的时间里就拿下了7分7个篮板。第三节比赛还有5分钟，朱芳雨在上线吸引防守之后交给了唐正东。此时，唐正东的身边并没有防守人，他犹豫了一下并没有马上进攻，美国明星队的防守球员很快合围过来，形成了三人包夹之势，唐正东转身强攻造成了对手的犯规。这样的一次进攻充分展现了唐正东现在的状态，在因伤离开赛场了一段时间之后，唐正东在场上的感觉还没有达到最佳状态，他在比赛中的攻防选择中还有一些犹豫，速度还有些慢。不过在这支美国明星队面前，唐正东的身高和体重仍然占据着绝对的优势，即使是三人合围，对手也只能用犯规来阻挡他的进攻。身高和体重上的优势，唐正东还会延续到亚洲赛场，只不过他需要赶快找到比赛场上的感觉，把脚步移动的速度提上来才行。虽然唐正东的状态并没有达到最佳，但有一点是可以肯定的，现在的大唐很努力。第三节还有3分42秒，唐正东在一次和对方争抢篮板当中倒地救球，要知道，这已经是他在本场比赛的第二次倒地救球了，这样的场面，即使是在唐正东状态稳稳的时候也没有看到，更何况现在他的膝伤还没有完全痊愈。至少从这点可以看出唐正东的努力态度。持球背身进攻，抢到前场篮板之后的二次进攻，妙传对手的助攻，尽管出场时间并不算太多，但唐正东已经在这场比赛中充分展现出了他在内线的威慑力。如果拿现在的表现和巅峰时的唐正东相比，只能说他刚刚恢复了50%，就算这样，他的效率平均下来也是不到两分钟就能拿下1分1个篮板了。央视的著名评论员苏群谈到唐正东的表现时说到：“在离开了赛场这么久之后，唐正东有99%的可能都会去打亚运会，特别是在苏伟因伤不能打的时候，这对他来说是个非常不错的表现机会。”唐正东上一次穿着国家队的战袍征战在国际赛场上，还要追溯到2006年的多哈亚运会。可那次经历对于唐正东来说却是不堪回首的。当时国家队的主帅还是脾气有些固执的尤纳斯，他只给了唐正东一场的表现机会，便彻底将大唐按在了板凳上。从那开始，唐正东就彻底跌入了低谷，他在联赛中不断遭遇伤病的困扰，国家队的集训更总是与他擦肩而过。现在，从伤病中走出来的唐正东终于有机会在亚运赛场上证明自己了，姚明和易建联因为征战NBA不能出战，苏伟又因伤不能打。对于唐正东来说，这也许是他职业生涯中最重要的一个转折点了。(乳娃娃)	朱芳雨,唐正东,尤纳斯,姚明,苏群,易建联,苏伟	正向	"What is the status of 50% Dong Tang? Sina Sports News On October 29, Beijing time, the Chinese men's basketball team played against another warm-up opponent, the American All-Star Team, before the Asian Games. Finally, the Chinese team defeated the opponent 92-64, winning the first victory of this series of warm-up matches. Dong Tang played well in this game, scoring 7 points and 7 rebounds in 13 minutes. With 5 minutes left in the third quarter, Zhu Fangyu gave it to Dong Tang after coming online to attract defense. At this time, there was no defender around Dong Tang, and he hesitated to attack immediately. The defensive players of the American All-Star Team quickly surrounded him to form a three man siege. Dong Tang turned to attack and caused the opponent to foul. This attack fully demonstrates the current status of Dong Tang. After leaving the court for some time due to injury, Dong Tang's feeling on the court has not reached the best state. He still has some hesitation in his choice of attack and defense in the game, and his speed is still slow. However, in front of this American All-Star Team, Dong Tang's height and weight still occupy an absolute advantage. Even if three people surround him, the opponent can only use fouls to stop his attack. Dong Tang's height and weight advantages will continue to extend to the Asian arena. He just needs to find the feeling on the court as soon as possible and speed up his foot movement. Although Dong Tang's status has not reached the best, one thing is for sure, the Datang now is very hard. With 3:42 seconds left in the third quarter, Dong Tang fell down to save the ball in a contest with the other side for rebounds. It should be noted that this was his second fall in this game to save the ball. Such a scene was not seen even when Dong Tang was in stable condition, let alone that his knee injury has not fully recovered now. At least from this point, we can see the efforts of Dong Tang. Holding the ball back to attack, the second attack after getting the front court rebound, and the wonderful pass to assist the opponent, although the playing time is not too much, Dong Tang has fully demonstrated his threat in the interior in this game. If the current performance is compared with the peak of Dong Tang, it can only be said that he has just recovered 50%. Even so, his average efficiency is less than two minutes to get 1 point and 1 rebound. Su Qun, a famous commentator of CCTV, talked about the performance of Dong Tang, saying: ""After leaving the court for so long, Dong Tang has a 99% chance of going to the Asian Games, especially when Su Wei can't play due to injury. This is a very good opportunity for him to perform."" Dong Tang last wore the national team's battle uniform to fight on the international stage, which can be traced back to the 2006 Doha Asian Games. But that experience was unbearable for Dong Tang. At that time, the head coach of the national team was Yonas, who was a bit stubborn. He only gave Dong Tang a chance to perform, and completely pressed Datang on the bench. From then on, Dong Tang completely fell into a low谷. He was constantly troubled by injuries in the league, and the national team's training always passed him by. Now, Dong Tang, who has come out from the injury, finally has the opportunity to prove himself in the Asian Games. Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian can not play because of the fight in the NBA, and Su Wei can not play because of injury. For Dong Tang, this may be the most important turning point in his career. (Baby)"

国奥惨败后集体拒绝采访教练组紧锁房门未进晚餐新浪体育讯　0-3，这是国奥队与韩国队比赛之前没有人想到的结果。就在三天之前，这支韩国球队还以1-4的大比分负于中国香港队。面对这样的结局，中国国奥队在赛后集体失声，晚餐时分教练组更是没有一个人下楼用餐。本场比赛吸引了很多国内的记者前来采访，因为大家都是冲着中国足球能够打破20年逢韩不胜的纪录来的。可是，最终大家又一次见证了中国足球的耻辱。比赛结束之后，主教练刘春明在发布会耐心地接受大家的采访。由于提问的记者很多，发布会结束之后，当记者们匆匆赶到混合采访区的时候，发现这里空无一人。正以为国奥已经走光的时候，志愿者告诉大家，国奥队还没有出来。直到发布会结束将近10分钟之后，国奥队的一行人才默默从休息室的通道内走出来。打头阵的是于洋等一些没有上场的替补，随着当主力队员走出来之后，面对等候在混采的记者们，大家都脚步匆匆地离开，即使偶尔有一两个人被拉住，也是面露难色地近乎用哀求的声音说到：哥，别采了，没啥好说的，而且也不让说。到底是谁不让说，还是借口。随后等候在混区的记者又拉住了两个队员，得到的回答一致的：队里真不让说。事实上就在比赛之前的踩场训练之时，国奥队就已经拒绝了一次媒体采访。即使是面对中央电视台的镜头，国奥队也以代表团有统一规定，只能在新闻发布会与混合采访区接受采访为由拒绝了赛前采访。可是，赛后在混合区，竟然冒出了“不让接受采访”的声音，队员们撇下这一句话之后，就匆匆跑上了大巴车，最后从休息室走出来的是领队李晓光，当记者们询问是不是不让接受采访之时，李晓光一脸疑惑：不能啊，没有啊。随后，有4家媒体再次来到了国奥队下榻的酒店。国奥队吃饭的时候是晚上10点30分，到了用餐的时候，队员们依旧一副失落的表情走进了餐厅。即使面对相熟的记者，也只是偶尔站住低声聊上几句。无奈之下，记者们只能来到楼上向询问个究竟。领队李晓光在了解了整个经过之后进行了解释：“之前代表团确实有规定，只能在发布会和混合采访区接受采访，所以赛前按照规定没有接受采访。但今天绝对没有说不让队员说话，应该是队员们心情不好。毕竟输了球，又是大比分，孩子们都很难过，这是可以理解的。但下一场保证会安排球员配合采访，即使是再输球、即使是队员们心情不好，自己也会把他们从大巴车上叫下来。”队员们没有心情接受采访，教练组则连吃饭的心情都没有了。直到队员们用过晚餐之后，几位教练也都没有走出房门，看来这个夜晚对于国奥来说，注定又是一个苦涩的难眠之夜。(宋词发自香港)	宋词,于洋,刘春明,李晓光	负向	"After the national Olympic team's defeat, the whole team refused to interview the coaching staff, locked the door and did not have dinner Sina Sports News 0-3, which was an unexpected result before the national Olympic team and the South Korean team. Just three days ago, this South Korean team lost to the Chinese Hong Kong team by a big score of 1-4. Faced with such an outcome, the Chinese Olympic team collectively lost their voice after the game, and no one in the coaching staff came downstairs for dinner at dinner time. This game has attracted many domestic journalists to interview, because everyone is aiming at China's football team to break the record of not winning in 20 years. However, once again, everyone witnessed the shame of Chinese football. After the game, the head coach Liu Chunming patiently accepted everyone's interview at the press conference. Because there were many journalists who asked questions, after the press conference, when the journalists hurried to the mixed interview area, they found that there was no one here. Just when I thought the National Olympic Team had lost all its money, the volunteers told everyone that the National Olympic Team had not come out. Nearly 10 minutes after the press conference ended, a group of people from the National Olympic Team quietly came out from the channel of the rest room. Yu Yang and some substitutes who did not play the leading role. When the main players come out, they all leave in a hurry when they face the waiting reporters in the mixed interview. Even if one or two people are stopped occasionally, they almost say in a pleading voice: Brother, don't pick it. There is nothing to say, and you are not allowed to say it. Who is not allowed to say it, or is it an excuse? Then, the reporter waiting in the mixed zone stopped two players, and the answer was the same: the team really didn't let them say. In fact, at the time of the field training before the game, the National Olympic Team had refused the media once. Even when facing the camera of CCTV, the National Olympic Committee refused the pre match interview on the grounds that the delegation had a unified regulation that it could only be interviewed at the press conference and the mixed interview area. However, after the game in the mixed area, there was a sound of ""not being allowed to be interviewed"". After the players left this sentence, they hurried to the bus. Li Xiaoguang, the leader, was the last one to come out from the rest room. When the journalists asked if they were not allowed to be interviewed, Li Xiaoguang was puzzled: No, no. Later, four media organizations came again to the hotel where the National Olympic Team was staying. The National Olympic Team had dinner at 10:30 in the evening. When they had dinner, the players still came into the restaurant with a lost look on their face. Even when facing familiar journalists, they only occasionally stopped to chat in a low voice.无奈之下，记者们只能来到楼上去问个究竟。领队李晓光在了解了整个经过之后解释说:“代表团之前确实有规定，只能在新闻发布会和混合采访区接受采访，所以赛前按规定没有接受采访。但是今天绝对没有说不让队员说话，应该是队员们心情不好。毕竟输了球，又是大比分，孩子们都很难过，这是可以理解的。但是下一场保证会安排球员配合采访，即使是再输球，即使是队员们心情不好，自己也会把他们从大巴车上叫下来。”队员们没有心情接受采访，教练组连吃饭的心情都没有。直到队员们用过晚餐之后，几位教练也没有走出房门，看来这个夜晚对于国奥来说，注定又是一个苦涩的不眠之夜。(宋词发自香港)"

家电网购渠道市场发展猛前景看好2011年“五一”过后，库巴网副总裁彭亮有点“上火”，这股火来自于“搬家”。2010年，库巴网的工作人员只有200多人，现在已经超过800人。“以前的办公室挤不下这么多人，我们只好一次次搬家。”彭亮说，“工作人员还在继续扩充，目前最迫切的问题是尽快租房子，否则办公室又要不够用了。”不久前，彭亮又租下瑞达大厦半层写字楼，这样，库巴网北京的办公面积在3000多平方米基础上新增了1000多平方米，在全国的办公面积已经超过1万平方米。5个月时间里，工作人员数量增长3倍。对此，彭亮不无自豪地告诉《电器》记者，工作人员数量的增长与网站销售额的增长呈正比。“2010年，库巴网销售额为5亿元，2011年将为15亿~20亿元。仅今年‘五一’促销期间，库巴网就实现了超过1亿元的销售额。”市场发展迅猛仅几天时间就实现1亿元的销售规模，这在去年对于多数家电网购平台来说都是不敢想象的。2010年，在家电网购渠道中，全年销售额超过1亿元的网站屈指可数。奥维咨询(AVC)数据表明，2010年，中国家电网购规模为80亿元，占家电市场整体规模的比重不到2%。在80亿元的销售规模中，京东商城和苏宁易购分别超过20亿元，居前两位，库巴网达到5亿元，新七天电器网为5.5亿元，淘宝电器城、新蛋网均超过1亿元。业内人士表示，与2010年相比，2011年各传统渠道纷纷发力网络平台，家电网购市场会呈现爆发式增长。2011年2月23日，苏宁电器发布了以电子商务发展为重点的《2011年整体发展规划》，宣布成立独立运作的公司——苏宁易购，与实体连锁零售业务平行，力争实现销售额翻两番、达到80亿元的目标，并在不久的将来实现100亿元的销售收入。4月，改版后的国美(微博)网上商城(www.gome.com.cn)正式上线。国美规划，未来2~3年网上商城将占其销售额的10%以上，并将占据中国家电网购市场容量的15%以上。新七天电器网总裁左英杰认为，2011年，京东商城、淘宝电器城都有望实现40亿元的家电销售规模，国美网上商城和库巴网合计达到40亿元，新七天实现5亿~8亿元。如果苏宁能实现100亿元销售规模，2011年中国家电网购销售规模将比2010年增长近2倍。奥维咨询(AVC)预测，家电网购未来几年将保持高速增长，预计2015年会突破千亿元规模，占家电市场总体规模的比重达14%，成为家电市场的第三大渠道业态。目前中国家电网络渠道的竞争主体已形成三大类平台，即以京东商城和淘宝电器城为代表的第三方B2C家电网络平台、以国美和苏宁为代表的传统连锁渠道网络平台、以各品牌商为代表的企业自建网络平台。从销售规模来看，京东商城、国美电器(微博)(包括国美网上商城、库巴网)、苏宁易购、淘宝电器城、新七天电器网已经树立行业地位。业内人士称，第三方B2C家电网络平台和传统连锁渠道网络平台是网络渠道发展的主力军，企业自建网站因产品单一、没有价格优势，与其他两个渠道相比销售规模较小。2011年，家电企业自建网络平台的销售业绩也在增长，但是与其他两大平台相比增幅较小。作为企业自建网站，从2010年5月到现在，海信网上商城已经上线整整1年。海信科龙(微博)电子商务部总经理禚洪斋说：“到目前为止，海信网上商城销量已经超过上线初期公司规定的任务量，但是中国家电网购市场发展如此迅速，我们销售规模的增长情况并未达到心理预期。”与此同时，禚洪斋表示，虽然海信有自建的网上商城，但是七成多的网上销售额仍来自第三方B2C家电网购平台。一些企业正在着手准备自建网上商城。帅康集团常务副总裁刘春华告诉《电器》记者，网络渠道是家电销售未来的发展方向。两年前，帅康组建了网络营销部，这是国内厨电企业的第一个网络营销部门。“帅康目前在第三方B2C家电网络平台的销售业绩占公司总销售额的比重是5%~8%。我们明年初准备推出自建的网上商城。该商城不仅仅是个销售平台，同时还是信息交换平台、品牌展示平台和用户交流平台，我们将在上面建立论坛，还要利用微博和用户互动。我们之所以用3年时间对网上商城进行前期搭建，也是考虑到网络是把‘双刃剑’，它可以把一个企业的优势和劣势都无限放大。”奥克斯网上商城也在建设中。据奥克斯有关负责人介绍，奥克斯三年前就意识到争夺网络阵地的战略意义，并于2009年9月与淘宝网展开合作。网上商城的主要作用是为企业提供宣传产品和服务的机会，拉近与客户间的距离，使企业和消费者沟通得更顺畅。“与2010年相比，2011年奥克斯在第三方网站上的销售额增长已超出预期，奥克斯正在扩充网购部门人手以应对快速增长的业务量。”如此快速增长与奥克斯的产品布局有关，奥克斯在网上销售的产品与线下有所不同，网购产品以网络专供机型为主、常规机型为补充。合作共赢新模式随着市场的壮大，2011年，家电网络营销出现了一些新模式。2010年之前，三种类型网络渠道平台一直各自为政。随着2010年11月22日国美收购库巴网，第三方家电网络平台与传统连锁渠道开始第一次合作，开创了网络渠道的新模式。改版后的国美网上商城上线后，国美电器总裁王俊洲表示，国美将采用双品牌方式参与电子商务竞争，“两个电子商务平台将共享国美的物流、采购、服务及人力资源”。面对国美与库巴网的合作，一些业内人士表示困惑。一位家电品牌企业网站管理人员认为，国美的双品牌战略是“雾里看花”。“国美网上商城和库巴网销售的都是国美线下产品，销售相同的产品必然存在竞争，而库巴网作为‘后娘养大的孩子’，在与国美网上商城的竞争中会处于不利地位，早晚会消失。”针对此种说法，彭亮表示，2011年库巴网超过300%的销售增速足以证明这种合作是正确的。“家电行业本身是高度垄断的行业，近十年来，中国家电行业没有出现比较有代表性的新品牌。由此可见，在行业内想依靠一己之力创造品牌很困难。库巴网从2006年开始在网上销售家电，是中国最早销售家电的网站，但是到2009年，我们在发展上看到了‘天花板’。我们之前面临的许多困境，包括供应链难题等，相信其他网站同样也会遇到。国美具有1000多亿元的采购规模，在行业内占据着优势地位。在与国美的合作中，我们整合了国美的供应链资源，才会有现在的规模，这种合作是一种共赢。”国美网上商城总经理韩德鹏告诉《电器》记者，国美网上商城改版上线后，一个月就实现600%的销售增长。这也从一个侧面印证了合作共赢。	韩德鹏,彭亮,王俊洲,左英杰,禚洪斋,刘春华	正向	"The market development of home appliance online shopping channel is promising. After May 1, 2011, Peng Liang, vice president of Cuba com, was a bit ""on fire"", which came from ""moving"". In 2010, the staff of Cuba com was only more than 200, and now it has exceeded 800. ""The office used to be too crowded for so many people, so we had to move again and again."" Peng Liang said, ""The staff is still expanding. The most urgent problem at present is to rent a house as soon as possible, otherwise the office will not be enough again."" Not long ago, Peng Liang rented half a floor of office building in Ruida Building. As a result, the office area of Cuba com in Beijing was more than 1000 square meters on the basis of more than 3000 square meters, and the office area in the country has exceeded 10000 square meters. In five months, the number of staff increased three times. In this regard, Peng Liang proudly told the reporter of Electrical appliances that the growth of the number of staff was proportional to the growth of the website sales. ""In 2010, the sales volume of Cuba com was 500 million yuan, and it will be 1.5 ~ 20 billion yuan in 2011. During this year's May 1st promotion, Cuba com achieved sales of more than 100 million yuan."" It was unimaginable for most home appliance online shopping platforms last year to realize the sales scale of 100 million yuan in just a few days. In 2010, there were few websites with annual sales of more than 100 million yuan in the home appliance online shopping channel. AVC data shows that in 2010, the scale of China's home appliance online shopping was 8 billion yuan, less than 2% of the overall scale of the home appliance market. Among the sales scale of 8 billion yuan, Jingdong Mall and Suning Shopping exceeded 2 billion yuan, ranking first, Cuba com reached 500 million yuan, the new seven day electric appliance network was 550 million yuan, Taobao Electric Appliance City and New Egg Network exceeded 100 million yuan. Industry insiders said that compared with 2010, the traditional channels all made efforts in 2011 to develop the Internet platform, and the home appliance online shopping market would show explosive growth. On February 23, 2011, Suning Electric released the ""Overall Development Plan for 2011"" with the development of e-commerce as the focus, announcing the establishment of a separate company - Suning Shopping, parallel to the physical chain retail business, aiming to achieve the goal of doubling sales to 8 billion yuan, and achieving sales revenue of 1 billion yuan in the near future. In April, the redesigned Gome (microblog) online shopping mall (www.gome.com.cn) was officially launched. Gome plans that in the future 2-3 years, the online shopping mall will account for more than 10% of its sales, and it will occupy more than 15% of the market capacity of China's home appliance online shopping market. Zuo Yingjie, President of New Seven Days Electric Network, believes that in 2011, Jingdong Mall and Taobao Electric Appliance City are expected to achieve an appliance sales scale of 4 billion yuan, and the combined sales of Gome Online Shopping Mall and Cuba com will reach 4 billion yuan, and New Seven Days will achieve 500 million ~ 800 million yuan. If Suning can achieve a sales scale of 10 billion yuan, the sales scale of home appliance online shopping in China in 2011 will almost double that in 2010. AVC forecasts that home appliance online shopping will maintain rapid growth in the coming years, and is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan in 2015, accounting for 14% of the overall scale of the home appliance market, becoming the third largest channel in the home appliance market. At present, the competition subjects of China's home appliance network channel have formed three major platform categories, namely, the third-party B2C home appliance network platform represented by Jingdong Mall and Taobao Electric Appliance City, the traditional chain channel network platform represented by Gome and Suning, and the self-built network platform represented by brand enterprises. In terms of sales scale, Jingdong Mall, Gome (microblog) (including Gome online mall, Cuba com), Suning E-shopping, Taobao Electric Appliance City and New Seven Days Electric Appliance Network have established their industry status. Industry insiders said that the third-party B2C home appliance network platform and the traditional chain channel network platform are the main force in the development of network channels, and the self-built website of enterprises has a small sales scale compared with the other two channels because of the single product and no price advantage. In 2011, the sales performance of home appliance enterprises' self-built network platform also grew, but the growth rate was small compared with the other two major platforms. As an enterprise's self-built website, Hisense Online Shopping Mall has been online for a whole year from May 2010 to now. Zhuge Hongzhai, general manager of Hisense Kelong (microblog) E-commerce Department, said: ""Up to now, Hisense Online Shopping Mall's sales have exceeded the task specified by the company at the beginning of its launch, but the development of China's home appliance online shopping market is so rapid that our growth of sales scale has not reached the psychological expectation."" At the same time, Zhuge Hongzhai said that although Hisense has its own online shopping mall, more than 70% of the online sales still come from the third-party B2C home appliance online shopping platform. Some enterprises are preparing to build their own online shopping malls. Liu Chunhua, executive vice president of Shuikang Group, told the reporter of Electric Appliance that the network channel is the future development direction of home appliance sales. Two years ago, Shuikang set up a network marketing department, which was the first network marketing department of domestic cooking appliance enterprises. ""Shuikang's sales performance on the third party B2C home appliance network platform accounts for 5% -8% of the company's total sales. We are going to launch our self-built online shopping mall in January next year. The shopping mall is not only a sales platform, but also an information exchange platform, a brand display platform and a user communication platform. We will set up a forum on it, and we will also use microblog to interact with users. The reason why we spent three years on the preliminary construction of the online shopping mall is that we also consider that the network is a 'double-edged sword', which can infinitely magnify the advantages and disadvantages of an enterprise."" Aoxi Online Shopping Mall is also under construction. According to the relevant person in charge of Aoxi, Aoxi realized the strategic significance of competing for the Internet position three years ago, and cooperated with Taobao in September 2009. The main function of the online shopping mall is to provide opportunities for enterprises to publicize their products and services, close the distance with customers, and make the communication between enterprises and consumers smoother. ""Compared with 2010, Aoxi's sales growth on the third party website in 2011 has exceeded expectations, and Aoxi is expanding the manpower of the online shopping department to deal with the rapidly growing business."" Such rapid growth is related to the product layout of Aoxi. The products sold online by Aoxi are different from the offline ones, and the online products are mainly supplemented by the conventional models. Win win new model With the expansion of the market, some new models of home appliance network marketing appeared in 2011. Before 2010, the three types of network channel platforms were independent. With the acquisition of Cuba com by Gome on November 22, 2010, the third party home appliance network platform and the traditional chain channel began to cooperate for the first time, creating a new model of network channel. After the revised Gome online shopping mall was launched, Wang Junzhou, president of Gome Electrical Appliances, said that Gome would adopt a dual-brand approach to participate in e-commerce competition. ""The two e-commerce platforms will share the logistics, procurement, services and human resources of Gome"". In the face of the cooperation between Gome and Cuba com, some industry insiders are confused. A manager of an appliance brand enterprise website believes that Gome's dual brand strategy is ""looking at flowers in the fog"". ""Both Gome Online Shopping Mall and Cuba com sell Gome offline products. There must be competition between the same products. As a 'child raised by the stepmother', Cuba com will be at a disadvantage in the competition with Gome Online Shopping Mall, and will eventually disappear."" In response to this view, Peng Liang said that the sales growth rate of more than 300% in 2011 of Cuba com was enough to prove that this cooperation was correct. ""The home appliance industry itself is a highly monopolized industry. In the past decade, there has been no new brand with comparative representation in China's home appliance industry. It can be seen that it is difficult to rely on your own strength to create brands within the industry. Cuba com has been selling home appliances online since 2006, and it is the first website in China to sell home appliances. However, by 2009, we saw the 'ceiling' in our development. Many difficulties we faced before, including supply chain problems, I believe other websites will also encounter. Gome has a purchase scale of more than 100 billion yuan, which is in a dominant position in the industry. In cooperation with Gome, we have integrated Gome's supply chain resources, and we have the scale now. This cooperation is a win-win situation."" Han Depeng, general manager of Gome Online Shopping Mall, told the reporter of Electric Appliance that Gome Online Shopping Mall achieved a sales growth of 600% in the first month after its revision was launched. This also verifies the win-win cooperation from one side."
低端直板机LG发布GS106GS107GS155文/andy921在低端手机市场，向来不缺乏经典机型，比如诺基亚1系列和2系列，还有三星跟LG的众多机型。日前，LG手机在国外连续发布了三款低端直板机GS106、GS107、GS155。LGGS106和GS107设计颇为相似，主要区别我们可以从图中看出来，在于导航键的设计，GS106采用的是金属按键设计，而GS107则是塑料设计。参数上两机很相似，都采用的是一块1.5英寸128*128像素的屏幕，机身尺寸和重量都一样，尺寸为103.9x43.5x12.9mm，重约70克。从屏幕下方的字来看，两款手机主打的FM收音机都能，这在低端手机里也是一个比较好的卖点。此外，两机标配950mAh锂电池，支持GSM900/1800MHz网络以及microUSB连接。另外一款LGGS155则在手机机身颜色上打了主意，GS155推出多达五种颜色，手机的硬件参数基本跟GS106/GS107一样，屏幕都是1.5英寸128*128像素，也支持FM收音机功能，只是在尺寸和重量上略微不同，GS155机身尺寸为103.9x44.5x13.9mm，重约66.8克。GS155同样标配950mAh锂电池，支持GSM900/1800MHz网络以及microUSB连接。		正向	LG released GS106GS107GS155 at the bottom of the flat machine. Andy921 In the low-end mobile phone market, there have never been any classic models, such as Nokia 1 series and 2 series, and many models of Samsung and LG. Recently, LG mobile phones released three low-end bar phones GS106, GS107 and GS155 abroad. LGGS106 and GS107 are quite similar in design. The main difference we can see from the picture is the design of the navigation key. GS106 adopts the metal key design, while GS107 is the plastic design. The parameters of the two machines are very similar. They both use a 1.5 inch 128*128 pixel screen. The size and weight of the fuselage are the same. The size is 103.9x43.5x12.9mm and the weight is about 70g. Judging from the words under the screen, the FM radio of the two mobile phones is the main feature, which is also a good selling point in low-end mobile phones. In addition, the two machines come standard with a 950mAh lithium battery, which supports GSM900/1800MHz network and microUSB connection. Another LGGS155 made a lot of sense in the color of the mobile phone. GS155 launched as many as five colors. The hardware parameters of the mobile phone are basically the same as GS106/GS107. The screen is 1.5 inch 128*128 pixels, and it also supports FM radio function. However, the size and weight are slightly different. The size of GS155 is 103.9x44.5x13.9mm and weighs about 66.8g. GS155 also comes standard with a 950mAh lithium battery, which supports GSM900/1800MHz network and microUSB connection.

足球宝贝二外美女：因为梅西盼阿根廷夺冠(图)7月12日，是夏敏21岁的生日，也是南非世界杯决赛日。夏敏有一个小小的愿望，希望梅西能捧得大力神杯，也算是她最好的生日礼物了。“希望决赛是在阿根廷和巴西队之间进行。当然，最好的结果是：阿根廷夺冠、梅西进球。这是给我的最好的生日礼物。”夏敏不是很热爱足球，但她对南非世界杯却有着独特的感受，因为她喜欢狂野的非洲。喜欢旅游的夏敏，去过很多地方，她去过意大利、法国，她的下一站将是非洲。“我很想去非洲，倒不完全是因为世界杯，我喜欢待在非洲广袤的土地上，看动物大迁徙。”闭上双眼，夏敏想象着那壮丽的情形，“那是视觉和心灵的撞击。”爱屋及乌，对于梅西的迷恋也让夏敏喜欢上了阿根廷队，在已经结束的阿根廷队的两场比赛中，她都未能猜对比分，倒是猜中了巴西2比1战胜朝鲜。“我一直对亚洲球员很关注，而且我有种预感，韩国队一定会打进16强。”夏敏称倒不是因为对韩国队的喜爱，但基于都是亚洲人，她还是选择了支持韩国队。化妆支持：牛牛(东田造型)服装支持：H&M本版摄影：本报记者赵亢王远征采写：本报记者孙海光拍摄统筹：侯浩袁琳	梅西,夏敏,赵亢王远征,袁琳,孙海光,牛牛,侯浩	正向	"Football baby second foreign beauty: Because Messi hopes Argentina will win the championship (picture) On July 12, it was Xia Min's 21st birthday, and it was also the final day of the South Africa World Cup.

每日看盘：美元ETF回调至重大支撑昨天美股小幅跳空高开，但随后立即反转并在整个上午急剧跳水。中午时分，各大股指均已从盘中高点下跌2%或以上，同时成交量大幅放大。尽管上午的向下突破十分果断，下午大盘还是企稳并出现了一轮强劲反弹，不过收盘前最后一个小时再度迎来一定的抛盘。总体而言，下午的反弹极大地提升了多头的信心，因为它显然意味着投资者在逢低买进。罗素2000小型股指数从200日均线反弹，收盘跌幅仅为0.1%。道琼斯工业平均指数小幅下挫0.3%。标普500指数低收0.4%，标普400中型股指数和纳斯达克综合指数分别下跌0.5%和0.6%。大部分股指均收于振幅中位偏下，不过大幅高于盘中低点。成交量全面激增，纽约证交所总成交量较上一交易日放大17%，纳斯达克交易所大增26%。放量下跌使得纳指和标普500再次出现“出货日”。市场内部力量对比收于平均水平，纳斯达克下跌股成交量与上升股成交量之比为2比1，纽交所该比率为1.2比1。尽管昨天的行情从技术上来讲是一个“出货日”，但我们并不能说它是一个相当利空的交易日，因为空头和多头都有一番表现。由于接近日线图上200日均线的支撑，本周PowerSharesU.S.DollarBullIndex(UUP)重新回到了我们的观察名单之上：UUP存在一个来自2-4月份的强大水平价格支撑。周线图显示UUP此轮回调幅度为略微超过从2009年12月低点到2010年6月高点的50%斐波纳契折线，从而给我们提供了收益-风险比为正的交易机会。另外，欧元(FXE)正上涨到一个巨大的水平价格阻力，因此有可能很快恢复其下跌趋势。UUP的这一建仓形态为中长线机会，因为眼下并没有足够的正面价格动能让短线交易者可以跟进。200日均线依然在标普500指数的日线图上构成铜墙铁壁一般的阻力：尽管上周各大股指均返回50日均线上方，然而我们并未看到出现一波后续的强劲买盘，可以暗示市场已经准备启动一轮大规模上涨。在标普500指数清除200日均线的阻力之前，我们预计大盘还将出现更多宽幅振荡的价格走势。(本文作者：DeronWagnerofTheWagnerDaily)		正向	"Daily disk watching: The dollar ETF adjusted to the major support. Yesterday, the U.S. stock market opened slightly higher, but then immediately reversed and plunged sharply throughout the morning. At noon, all the stock indexes had fallen more than 2% from the intraday high, and the trading volume expanded significantly. Although the downward breakout in the morning is very decisive, the market is still stabilizing in the afternoon and there is a strong rebound. However, there is another round of selling in the last hour before closing. In general, the rebound in the afternoon greatly enhances the confidence of the bulls, because it obviously means that investors are buying at low levels. The Russell 2000 Small Stock Index rebounded from the 200-day moving average, closing down only 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell slightly by 0.3%. The S&P 500 Index closed down 0.4%, the S&P 400 MidCap Index and the NASDAQ Composite Index fell 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. Most stock indexes closed at the lower median of the amplitude, but much higher than the intra day low. Trading volume surged across the board, with the total trading volume of the New York Stock Exchange up 17% from the previous trading day, and the NASDAQ Stock Exchange up 26%. The fact that the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are again ""shipping days"" on the day of volume decline. The internal force contrast of the market ended at the average level, the ratio of the declining stock trading volume to the rising stock trading volume on NASDAQ was 2 to 1, and the ratio on NYSE was 1.2 to 1. Although yesterday's market was technically a ""shipping day"", we can not say that it was a quite negative trading day, because both the bears and the bulls have a show. Because it is close to the support of the 200 day moving average on the daily line chart, the PowerSharesU.S.DollarBullIndex (UUP) has returned to our watch list this week: UUP has a strong horizontal price support from February to April. The weekly chart shows that the UUP has retraced slightly more than 50% of the Fibonacci line from the low point in December 2009 to the high point in June 2010, providing us with a trading opportunity with a positive return-risk ratio. In addition, the euro (FXE) is rising to a huge horizontal price resistance, so it is possible to resume its downward trend soon. This position building pattern of UUP is an opportunity for medium and long lines, because there is not enough positive price momentum at present for short-term traders to follow. The 200-day moving average still constitutes a copper wall and iron wall resistance on the daily chart of the S&P 500 Index: Although the major indexes returned to above the 50-day moving average last week, we did not see a follow-up strong buying wave, which could suggest that the market is ready to start a large-scale rise. We expect more wide range price fluctuations in the market before the S&P 500 Index clears the resistance of the 200-day moving average. (Author of this article: DeronWagnerofTheWagnerDaily)"
老教师为救患病儿子当街卖字□记者王勇本报讯昨日，在郑州市陇海路与嵩山路交叉口的人行道上出现这样一幕：郑州市华夏中学59岁的朱永廷老师，在老伴的帮助下，摊开他书写的书法作品，一张白纸上写着：“卖字救子！”老教师的举动引起了路人的关注。“献出爱心，救救我儿子！随意捐点钱，送给您一幅我的字！”昨日上午，朱永廷在街头吆喝着。朱永廷教书有32年了，有6届高考语文成绩第一名获得者出自他的班级。朱永廷说，他老家在开封，儿子朱淼泓今年31岁，儿子4个月大时，在被人抱着的时候不慎摔倒在地，导致颅内出血，此后儿子的症状始终没有缓解，自理能力都没有。2007年，他的儿子经省人民医院和郑大第一附属医院的专家会诊，确诊为多发性神经纤维瘤病。为给儿子看病，朱永廷夫妇跑了十几个省市的医院，始终没有治好，眼下面临再次手术，但数万元费用难倒了他们。许多人路过朱永廷的“卖字摊”前时，都忍不住看上几眼，纷纷拿出钱给老教师，大部分人捐钱后并没有拿走老教师的书法作品。其中一名公司老板了解情况后，掏出1000元交给朱永廷。昨日下午，记者来到了郑州市华夏中学，学校领导和老师都说，朱永廷老师和老伴对自己身患重病的儿子始终不离不弃。“学校老师都非常感动，我们多次要为他们家捐款，遭到了他们的拒绝。”	朱淼泓,王勇,朱永廷	正向	"The old teacher sold his words on the street to save his sick son □ Reporter Wang Yong reported yesterday that at the pedestrian crossing of Long Hai Road and Songshan Road in Zhengzhou, there was a scene: Zhu Yongting, 59 years old, a teacher of Huaxia Middle School in Zhengzhou, with the help of his wife, spread out his calligraphy works, and a white paper wrote: ""Sell words to save children!"" The old teacher's actions attracted the attention of passers-by. ""Give love and save my son! Give me a piece of money and give me a piece of calligraphy!"" Zhu Yongting shouted in the street yesterday morning. Zhu Yongting has been teaching for 32 years, and six of his students who won the first place in the college entrance examination's Chinese language scores. Zhu Yongting said that his son Zhu Mao Hong is 31 years old this year. When his son was four months old, he fell to the ground accidentally when he was being held in his arms, causing cerebral hemorrhage. After that, his son's symptoms have not been relieved, and he has no self-care ability. In 2007, his son was diagnosed with multiple neurofibromatosis by experts from the Provincial People's Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengda University. In order to treat his son, Zhu Yongting and his wife ran more than a dozen hospitals in provinces and cities, but they never got better. Now they are faced with another operation, but they can't afford the cost of tens of thousands of yuan. When many people pass by Zhu Yongting's ""word selling stall"", they can't help but take a few looks and give money to the old teacher. Most of them did not take away the old teacher's calligraphy works after donating money. One company boss gave 1000 yuan to Zhu Yongting after learning about the situation. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter came to Huaxia Middle School in Zhengzhou. The school leaders and teachers all said that Teacher Zhu Yongting and his wife never abandoned their son who was seriously ill. ""The teachers in the school were very moved. We asked them to donate money to their family many times, but they refused."""
汇金大手笔增持能否掀起行情■主持人：陈琼■特约嘉宾：资深市场评论家秦洪■特约嘉宾：信达证券分析师马佳颖主持人：据建行12月2日晚间发布的公告，汇金公司自9月23日至11月28日，已通过上海证券交易所增持建设银行A股股份超过7000万股。这是汇金公司第二次出手增持建行股份，和之前增持200万股相比，汇金此次出手颇为“豪气”，你们觉得透露出什么信息？秦洪：一是保持持股的稳定，因为外资银行将持有更多的建行股权。二是为了向市场昭示汇金稳定A股市场走势的努力。马佳颖：10月份以来，管理层针对实体经济的利好可谓是“出手快，出拳重”，如果说“9·19”三大利好是管理层为了提振市场信心而出台的，有些“意思一下”的感觉，那么这次对资本市场的关注则是来“真格”的了，这从汇金近期大手笔增持建行就能够看出来。主持人：建设银行12月2日发布的公告同时称，汇金公司完成向美国银行转让其持有的建设银行195.8亿股H股，美国银行持股比例上升到19.13％。对于美国银行大举增持建行股份，有市场人士认为此举是为其减持做铺垫。怎么看？马佳颖：美国银行在本土遭遇金融危机、资本充足率和流动性都陷入困境的时候，为什么还大举增持建行股票，是值得思考的。按照协议约定，美国银行此次增持在2011年8月29日之前不能转让，所以短期内大举减持的可能性不大。主持人：汇金的增持举动会给A股市场和银行股带来怎样的影响？秦洪:对A股市场来说，会改善预期，至少可以向市场折射出管理层稳定市场的努力以及背后的期望值。对于银行股来说，则可以带来估值的改善，同时也向市场表示银行股的价值已明显，银行股或将迎来底部。马佳颖：我认为，第一，由于前期以基金为主的机构资金还在大规模减持权重股，特别是银行股，那么此次汇金的增持，有管理层间接树立机构投资者信心的意思；第二，近期A股市场走势摆脱外盘干扰，在30日均线和60日均线之间窄幅震荡，而随着做多热情的逐渐消耗，市场能够维持多长时间的盘整不好说，汇金在现阶段大举增持银行股，会在一定程度上稳定市场重心，为1900点附近的支撑再增添一个筹码。不过从全球经济走势和我国的预期来看，我们并不看好A股市场的系统性机会，因此汇金增持银行股，我个人认为只是稳定市场，不能带来银行股和A股市场的大幅上涨。主持人:昨天午后大盘呈现久违的放量上升势头，是不是也是得益于汇金增持带来的提振作用？秦洪:之间存在着一定的必然联系，这一信号与前期社保基金增加二级市场股票投资等联系在一起，向市场折射出政策面继续回暖的态势。马佳颖：在政策做多的背景下，市场人气被充分调动，但是银行股、煤炭股等大盘权重股的上涨，和投机资金参与的题材股不同，它一定是要有基本面支撑，而现在显然不具备这样的环境。所以，我个人对蓝筹股的上涨持谨慎态度，有可能意味着反弹已经进入尾声。主持人:汇金增持、社保基金增仓等一系列举动是不是可以视为“市场底部已经到来”的信号？秦洪:这并不存在必然的逻辑推理。马佳颖：目前沪指再次来到60日均线附近，这已经是反弹以来第三次冲击这个关键的点位，这个时候蓝筹股启动，有带动股指强行冲关的意图，但是如果是靠拉抬指数突破60日均线，我个人感觉可持续性不强。下一交易日大盘走势判断您目前的仓位	马佳颖,秦洪,陈琼	正向	Can the large-scale share increase of CICC trigger a quotation
主持人东方卫视《我和春天有个约会》拼歌技新浪娱乐讯全国各地的主持人们在百忙之中齐聚东方春晚的舞台，除了唱歌跳舞外，所有主持人都转型成了“魔术师”，让观众眼前一亮。这是由东方卫视倾情打造的17天东方春晚的一台重头戏——《我和春天有个约会》，到今年已经是第六届了，为了迎接世博会的到来，虎年的《约会》全面升级，将于今晚(大年初八)19：30在东方卫视播出。全国名嘴倾情加盟浙江卫视朱丹新歌首唱因为2009全国主持人《舞林大会》的热播，不少全国各台的名嘴都和东方卫视结下了深厚的感情，此次《我和春天有个约会》更是真正意义上成为了主持人的嘉年华聚会，来自浙江卫视的当家花旦朱丹、北京卫视的美女主持陈晨、新疆卫视的娜地拉、云南卫视的江钰婷、安徽卫视的开心果张杨果而都倾情加盟，除了美女主持，还有沈凌、刘刚、刘尔金等多位全能男主持的加入，载歌载舞，使出浑身解数，不少各台名嘴都是放下手头的重要节目来到东方卫视。为此，本台晚会的总策划林海表示了感激之情：“特别谢谢这些其他电视台的主持人，真的非常辛苦。”浙江卫视的当家花旦朱丹，更是选择了在《我和春天有个约会》首度开唱她的最新单曲《想起》，她牵着林海的手表示：“谢谢生命中的很多人，我很珍惜你们。”外国歌曲信手拈来曹可凡跳起“Nobody”《我和春天有个约会》今年有了明确的主题，晚会分为几个部分，首先是生肖歌曲轮唱，程雷的《龙的传人》，倪琳的《千年等一回》都博得阵阵掌声。为了迎接世博，此次主持人都被要求唱起了外国歌曲，这些当然难不倒“嘴上功夫”了得的他们，无论是金炜模仿的Vitas，还是倪琳用日语倾情献的《血疑》主题曲，都将晚会带向了高潮。你方唱罢我登场，除了演绎动听歌曲，当然还少不了跳舞，特别是精心编排的2009年度最红舞蹈“Nobody”一度掀起了现场的高潮，曹可凡、刘刚这些平时完全和舞蹈沾不上边的男主持，竟然成为了主角，憨态可掬的表演，加上敦实的身材，现场观众笑声连连，留下了深刻的印象，林海透露：“让曹老师跳这个舞，我们采取了慢慢渗透的办法。”曹可凡本人也激动表示：“我就排练了一天，主要就是做林海的垫背。”戴军“复古”唱《阿莲》今年《我和春天有个约会》还有个板块就是经典老歌回顾，曹可凡坐在摩托车上翻唱了王杰的《安妮》，颇有一番滋味，红遍大江南北的《阿莲》原唱者戴军，时隔多年再次唱起熟悉的旋律，现场的观众报以热烈的掌声，不少都红了眼眶，背景更是配上了当年戴军演绎《阿莲》的风采。每个年代的观众都在一首首金曲中重拾往昔的种种。名嘴表演魔术“洋相百出”今年特别增加的魔术，也被总策划林海称为“最困难”的表演：“让主持人唱歌跳舞完全难不倒他们，但是表演魔术就有不少麻烦了。”丹丹、娜地拉和贝贝表演的快速换装，令人啧啧称奇；程雷、王冠、晓峰和江钰婷表演了扣人心弦的漂浮术，当王冠成功地漂浮在半空中，观众们连连发出惊叹，到了周瑾、吉雪萍等四位女主持这里，就颇为尴尬了——先是周瑾“大变活鱼”的小鱼提前跳出来，再是王冠的“甩绳变鱼”的金鱼死死咬住她的衣服不放，这场魔术带给观众的更多是笑意。不过，平时忙于工作的主持人能够在短时间内领悟魔术要领，还是值得肯定的。总策划林海谦虚地表示：“我对收视率不敢期待，今年只是试水。”	林海,吉雪萍,曹可凡,朱丹,刘尔金,刘刚,陈晨,张杨果而,程雷,贝贝,王冠,江钰婷	正向	"The host of Dragon TV's ""I Have a Date with Spring"" is Sina Entertainment News. Hosts from all over the country gather on the stage of Dragon TV's Spring Festival Evening Party in their busy schedule. In addition to singing and dancing, all hosts have transformed into ""magicians"", which is a highlight for the audience. This is a major event of the 17-day Oriental Spring Festival Gala, which has been successfully held for six years. In order to welcome the arrival of the Expo, the Tiger Year's ""Date"" has been fully upgraded and will be broadcast on Dragon TV at 19:30 tonight (the eighth day of the New Year). Zhu Dan, a famous host in China, joined Zhejiang Satellite TV to sing his new song for the first time. Because the 2009 national host's ""Dance Forest Conference"" was very popular, many famous hosts from all major stations have developed a deep friendship with Dragon TV. This ""I Have a Date with Spring"" has really become a carnival gathering for hosts. Zhu Dan, a popular旦旦from Zhejiang Satellite TV, Chen Chen, a beautiful host from Beijing Satellite TV, Nadila, Yunnan Satellite TV, Jiang Yuting, and Zhang Yangguo, a happy fruit from Anhui Satellite TV, have all joined in. In addition to the beautiful host, there are also many versatile male hosts, such as Shen Ling, Liu Gang, Liu Erjin, who have made all efforts to sing and dance, and many famous hosts from major stations have put down the important programs in their hands and come to Dongfang Satellite TV. For this reason, Lin Hai, the chief planner of this evening party, expressed his gratitude: ""Thank you very much for these hosts from other TV stations, it's really hard for them."" Zhu Dan, the host of Zhejiang Satellite TV, chose to sing her latest single ""Think of You"" for the first time in ""I Have a Date with Spring"". She said to Lin Hai: ""Thank you very much for many people in my life, I cherish you very much."" Cao Kefan jumps ""Nobody"" with his foreign songs at his hand. ""I have a date with spring"" has a clear theme this year. The party is divided into several parts. First of all, the zodiac songs are sung in turn. Cheng Lei's ""Descendants of the Dragon"" and Ni Lin's ""Waiting for a Thousand Years"" have won applause. In order to welcome the Expo, the hosts were all required to sing foreign songs this time. Of course, they were not difficult for them with ""oral skills"". Whether it was Jin Wei's imitation of Vitas or Ni Lin's passionate offering of the theme song of ""Blood Doubt"" in Japanese, the party was brought to a climax. You sing and I take the stage. Of course, there is no shortage of dancing. In particular, the most popular dance of 2009, ""Nobody"", once set off a climax on the spot. Cao Kefan, Liu Gang and other male hosts who are completely unrelated to dance usually became the main actors. The lovely performance, combined with the solid figure, made the audience laugh, leaving a deep impression. Lin Hai revealed: ""We adopted the method of slowly infiltrating to let Teacher Cao dance."" Cao Kefan himself also said excitedly: ""I just rehearsed for one day, mainly to make Lin Hai's job easier."" Dai Jun ""retro"" sings ""Ah Lian"" This year, ""I have a date with spring"" also includes a section of classic old song reviews. Cao Kefan sang Wang Jie's ""Annie"" on his motorcycle, which was quite interesting. Dai Jun, the original singer of ""Ah Lian"", which is popular all over the country, sang the familiar melody again after many years. The audience gave warm applause, and many of them had red eyes. The background was even more matched with Dai Jun's style of interpreting ""Ah Lian"" in those years. The audience of each era have regained all kinds of things in the past in a series of gold songs. The name mouth performs magic ""all kinds of jokes"" The magic that was specially added this year was also called ""the most difficult"" performance by Lin Hai, the chief planner: ""It is completely impossible for the host to let the host sing and dance, but it is quite troublesome to perform magic."" Dandan, Nadila and Beibei's quick change of clothes was amazing; Cheng Lei, Wang Guan, Xiaofeng and Jiang Yuting performed the thrilling floating technique. When Wang Guan successfully floated in the air, the audience kept exclamating. When it came to Zhou Jin, Jixueping and other four female hosts, it was quite embarrassing - first, the small fish of Zhou Jin's ""Live Fish Changing"" jumped out in advance, and then Wang Guan's ""Rope Throwing Fish"" goldfish bit her clothes tightly. The magic brought more smile to the audience. However, it is still worth肯定that the hosts who are usually busy with work can understand the essentials of magic in a short time. Lin Hai, the chief planner, modestly said: ""I dare not expect the ratings. This year is just a test of water."""
南非欧风劲爆桑巴狂舞郁金含苞待放斗牛需战胜自己随着西班牙在伊比利亚半岛“德比”胜出，南非世界杯的“八骏图”也全部出炉。南美球队占据半壁江山，欧洲球队占据了其中的三个席位，又一场欧美大战即将上演。而亚非两片大陆只有加纳晋级八强，也使亚非足球继续生活在欧美足球的夹缝之中。郁金飘香提及荷兰，不由让人想起了田园风光与风车轮转，而他们的足球，则往往是悲情的代言词。这不是一个笑话，荷兰足球引领了全攻全守、进攻足球的风暴，但是他们从来没有在世界杯中夺魁过。不过这次，郁金香终于等到了含苞待放的时候，罗本、斯内德、范佩西等一大群优秀球员的出现，让荷兰人看到了金杯的闪光。而范马尔维克的战术体系，在符合时下盛行的打法同时，也将荷兰球员的特点发挥得淋漓尽致。并且在这位慈父的带领下，荷兰球员摒弃了所有个人恩怨，将所有的心思都放在比赛之中。好牙遇硬骨头锋利的西班“牙”虽然有好胃口，但这次遇到了巴拉圭这块“硬”骨头。网友小跳斗牛狂想伊比利亚半岛从来都不会缺少探索的足迹，从哥伦布开始，众多的航海家都从这里出发，面对神秘的前景，在时刻充满威胁的航道上航行。如今的西班牙人继承了前辈们对于未知领域的好奇心，朝着他们第一座金杯迈进。华美优雅又带着刺客冷峻面容的斗牛士们，即将面对防守反击战素养极高的巴拉圭人。对于西班牙人而言，能够战胜他们的只剩下他们自己，没有夺冠经验的他们，或许顶不住心理的压力，状态不佳的托雷斯，或许无法重现金童的风采。如果西班牙能够将所有不利的因素通通顺利解决，那么在这场欧美对话中，高傲的欧洲人将再一次笑到最后。意志战车在欧洲足球的版图上，永远都存在这样一股强大势力，那就是有着顽强意志严明纪律的德意志战车。在解决了英格兰之后，他们将要对阵另一个“世仇”阿根廷队，这不仅仅是一场1/4决赛，更是一场关系到欧洲足球荣耀的比赛。德国和阿根廷之间的宿仇由来已久，在上一届德国世界杯当中，同样是在1/4决赛，德国人点球淘汰阿根廷，几乎创造了“冬天的童话”。但在本届世界杯上，我们看到了一支似曾相识但又不是非常熟悉的德国队。同样拥有钢铁般的意志，同样拥有铁血般的精神，这支德国队中更柔和了阿根廷人精湛的前场配合以及脚下技术。德国队在节节胜利的同时，带给我们极具冲击力的视觉享受。而笼罩在德国队身上的另一层光环则是阳光帅气。越来越多的女球迷爱上了德国队，而德国队主帅勒夫则成为潮流的代言词。在本赛季的欧洲各项比赛当中，德国人永远处于话题的中央，德国青年队在欧洲青年锦标赛中连连夺冠，德国的俱乐部球队纷纷杀入欧洲顶级联赛，这一系列利好消息让德国足球重新回到了一流球队的行列。对于目前的德国队而言，最大的问题就是球队过于年轻，而如果他们能够摆正心态，那么在南非的土地上，这群年轻人很有可能演绎一出精彩的“冬天童话”。非洲沙化非洲足球曾经带给我们太多惊喜，1990年的意大利之夏，喀麦隆人在揭幕战力克潘帕斯雄鹰；2002年的韩日世界杯，塞内加尔的青年禁卫军又一次让法国人俯首称臣。然而这一次在南非，他们几乎全军覆没，如果不是加纳人抓住了最后的救命稻草，非洲人将以耻辱结束本届世界杯。加纳足球在本届世界杯的出色表现，让所有球迷都眼前一亮，他们有着南美人细腻的脚法，而一群效力于欧洲联赛的球员又给他们带来了欧洲足球的整体概念。同时，加纳人又给非洲球队提了个醒，那就是要合理利用移民这股力量，加纳队中的23号球员博阿滕，出生在德国，此前拥有加纳和德国双重国籍，而且也曾经入选过德国的青年队但在世界杯开始之前，加纳足协接受了他，他顺利代表加纳出战，并且在几场比赛中都有上佳发挥，而类似博阿滕这种经历的球员在欧洲一抓一大把。本届世界杯，非洲球队实力的下降是有目共睹的，排除分组这个运气因素，非洲球队没有表现出必胜的决心。这两年，阻碍非洲足球发展的因素越来越多，很少有非洲国家有完备的联赛机制，而越来越多的青少年没有系统的青训指导，并且欧洲联赛一再限制非欧盟球员的加盟，也让越来越多向往欧洲联赛的年轻人放弃了本国国籍。由于贫穷导致的一系列不利因素，已经让曾经辉煌的非洲足球陷入到足球沙漠之中。亚洲期待需要感谢韩国和日本，如果不是这两支球队在本届世界杯上的出色发挥，亚洲恐怕又将无人问津。打法细化、任意球功底以及跑不死精神已经成为亚洲的旗帜，韩国队在这些基础上多了球星的概念，而日本足球在经过许多年的摸索后也有了自己的锋线尖刀。本届世界杯注定将成为朴智星和本田圭佑发挥的舞台，继首场比赛进球之后，朴智星在接下来的比赛中场场都成为韩国队全队的核心力量，即使在落后的时候，韩国人依然在朴老大的带领下奋勇向前。而日本小将本田圭佑更是成为了日本队的灵魂人物，他的细腻脚法以及在前场的拼劲让全世界领教了亚洲的力量。本届世界杯，亚洲拥有4.5个参赛名额，最终晋级到32强的4支球队都给世界留下了印象，随着韩国和日本队闯入16强，亚足联可以理直气壮地向成绩不佳的非洲足联讨取一个参赛名额。当然想要真正与世界强队抗衡，亚洲足球还有许多重要的事情要做，拒绝黑哨、拒绝假球这些喊了多年的口号依然没能制止赌球势力对亚洲足球的不利影响。而亚洲足球不能只靠日本韩国，西亚球队以及我们中国必须尽快迎头而上。圭兄圭弟“圭氏兄弟”的成功有分组运气，另一方面也靠着球队的整体实力。巴拉圭队一直秉承球队防守坚固的优点，他们在4场比赛中，仅丢1球，出色的防守让所有球队望尘莫及。而在接下来的比赛中，巴拉圭将要迎战西班牙队，面对火力十足的西班牙队，巴拉圭队是否能够延续他们良好的防守将至关重要。相比巴拉圭队的整体，乌拉圭队则更讲究个人技术，弗兰以及苏亚雷斯的个人能力将成为加纳队后防线的恶魔。当然乌拉圭队薄弱的中场控制能力将很有可能让他们在比赛中陷入被动。当然，这两支球队在本届世界杯中有一个很大的优势，那就是他们的许多球员都是来自于本国联赛。由于欧洲职业联赛的负担实在太重，许多大牌球员在赛前伤病缠身，而且欧洲联赛直到世界杯开赛前半月才全部结束，因此对于欧洲球员来说，身体和心理的双重疲惫，让南美球队在本届比赛中更加出彩。雄鹰风采谁都没有想到马拉多纳和他的阿根廷能在本届世界杯上一帆风顺，在外界看来，这个踢球超一流、人品三流、执教能力不入流的教练会让阿根廷队掉入到万劫不复的深渊中。但大家都错了，马拉多纳的认真和他的执着，已经让潘帕斯雄鹰脱胎换骨。在马拉多纳将梅西成功塑造成一个前腰后，从前锋线上后撤到中场的梅西逐渐崭露头角，但是让所有阿根廷球迷感到郁闷的是，梅西到目前为止依然没有进球。倒是伊瓜因在他的助攻下，登上了射手榜的榜首。阿根廷作为巴西最好的帮手，负载着为南美洲淘汰德国队的光荣使命，随着球队走上正轨，这些小精灵用他们完美的表现寄托着对于冠军的渴望。巴西人在南美足坛的统治地位无人能及。在里约热内卢的街头巷尾，到处都可以看到踢球的男孩，正是这样的氛围，造就了五星巴西的辉煌。邓加率领阳光男孩卡卡、单车少年罗比尼奥、怒吼天尊卢西奥，无论巴西队到哪里，他们都是聚光灯下的焦点。而桑巴军团在之前的4场比赛中的发挥，以及天时地利人和的优势，让我们看到了第六颗星的希望。巴西队一来到南非就享受到了其他球队所没有的待遇，南非境内绝大多数球迷除了支持本国球队之外，最支持的当属巴西队，巴西队在南非队出局之后，成为了南非球迷最大的精神寄托。而迄今为止在南半球举办的世界杯都是南美球队获得最终冠军，也让信奉魔咒学说的球迷更加期待巴西队的表演。在本届世界杯上，邓加的球队在战术选择上更加欧洲化。在防守反击战术大行其道的今天，巴西人同样加入到了这个战术的行列，在比赛中，你会发现优美的桑巴舞不见了，取而代之的是务实的传切配合。而如果让巴西人用“欧洲的方式”击败欧洲球队最终夺魁的话，那么欧洲球队是否应该在今后的比赛中多多汲取美洲球队的优点呢？见习记者陈欣闻四分之一决赛时间表荷兰VS巴西7月2日CCTV-522:00乌拉圭VS加纳7月3日CCTV-502∶30德国VS阿根廷7月3日CCTV-522:00巴拉圭VS西班牙7月4日CCTV-502∶30	斯内德,梅西,马拉多纳,托雷斯,卢西奥,伊瓜因,罗本,邓加,罗比尼奥,范佩西,范马尔维克,陈欣闻	正向	"The South African European style samba craze dance tulip is waiting for the bullfight to defeat itself. With Spain's victory in the ""Derby"" on the Iberian Peninsula, the ""Eight Pictures"" of the South African World Cup have also been completely released. South American teams occupy half of the world, and European teams occupy three of them, and another Euro American war is about to take place. However, only Ghana in Asia and Africa has reached the top eight, which also makes Asian and African football continue to live in the cracks of European and American football. When talking about the fragrance of saffron and mentioning the Netherlands, it is inevitable to think of the idyllic scenery and windmill wheels, while their football is often a synonym for tragedy. This is not a joke. Dutch football has led the storm of all-round attack and defense, and attack football, but they have never won the World Cup. However, this time, the tulip finally waited for the time to bud. The emergence of a large number of excellent players such as Robben, Sneijder, Van Persie and so on made the Dutch people see the flash of the gold cup. And Van Marwick's tactical system, while conforming to the prevailing style of play, also gives full play to the characteristics of Dutch players. And under the leadership of this kind father, the Dutch players abandoned all personal grievances and focused all their thoughts on the game. Good teeth meet hard bones Sharp Spanish ""teeth"", although with a good appetite, but this time we met Paraguay, a ""hard"" bone. The crazy bullfight of Netizens Iberian Peninsula has never been short of footsteps of exploration. Starting with Columbus, many navigators set out from here to face the mysterious prospect and sail on the threatening channel full of time. Nowadays, the Spaniards have inherited their predecessors' curiosity about unknown fields, and they are moving towards their first golden cup. The matadors, who are beautiful, elegant and have the cold face of assassins, are going to face the Paraguayans, who are highly skilled in defense counter attack. For the Spaniards, the only thing they can defeat is themselves. They have no experience in winning the championship. They may not be able to withstand the psychological pressure, and Torres, who is in poor condition, may not be able to regain the style of Children of Gold. If Spain can solve all the不利factors successfully, then in this dialogue between Europe and the United States, the proud Europeans will laugh last again. On the map of European football, there is always a strong force, that is, the German tank with tenacious will and strict discipline. After solving England, they will play against another ""mortal enemy"", Argentina. This is not only a quarter final, but also a game related to the glory of European football. The enmity between Germany and Argentina has been going on for a long time. In the last German World Cup, it was also a quarter final. The Germans eliminated Argentina with a penalty kick, almost creating a ""fairy tale in winter"". But in this World Cup, we saw a familiar but not very familiar German team. They also have the will of steel and the spirit of iron and blood. The German team is more gentle with the exquisite front court cooperation and foot skills of Argentine players. While the German team is winning victories, they bring us a visual enjoyment with great impact. Another halo that envelops the German team is sunshine and handsome. More and more female fans have fallen in love with the German team, and the head coach of the German team, Löw, has become the spokesman of the trend. In this season's various European competitions, the Germans are always in the center of the topic. The German youth team has won the championship in the European Youth Championship, and the German club teams have all killed the top European leagues. A series of good news has brought German football back to the ranks of first-class teams. For the current German team, the biggest problem is that the team is too young, and if they can adjust their mentality, these young people are likely to play an excellent ""winter fairy tale"" on the land of South Africa. African desertification African football has brought us too many surprises. In the summer of 1990, the Cameroonians defeated the Pampas Eagle in the opening game; In the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, the Senegalese youth guards once again made the French people surrender. However, this time in South Africa, they were almost completely defeated. If the Ghanaians had not caught the last straw, the Africans would have ended this World Cup in disgrace. The excellent performance of Ghanaian football in this World Cup has made all fans look bright. They have the delicate footwork of South Americans, and a group of players who play in the European League have brought them the overall concept of European football. At the same time, the Ghanaians also gave a reminder to the African team, that is, to make reasonable use of the power of immigration. Boaten, a 23 year old player in the Ghana team, was born in Germany. He had dual nationalities of Ghana and Germany before, and he also selected the German youth team. But before the World Cup, the Ghana Football Association accepted him. He successfully represented Ghana in the game, and he also had a good performance in several games. There are a lot of players in Europe who have similar experience to Boaten. In this World Cup, the decline of African teams is obvious. Excluding the luck factor of grouping, African teams have not shown the determination to win. In recent two years, more and more factors have hindered the development of African football. Few African countries have complete league mechanisms, and more and more teenagers have no systematic youth training guidance. Moreover, the European League has repeatedly restricted non EU players from joining, which also makes more and more young people who aspire to the European League give up their nationalities. A series of adverse factors caused by poverty have let the once glorious African football fall into the football desert. Asia needs to thank South Korea and Japan. If it were not for the excellent performance of these two teams in this World Cup, Asia would have been ignored again. The detailed play style, free throw skills and the indomitable spirit have become the banner of Asia. The South Korean team has the concept of star on this basis, while the Japanese football team has its own sharp knife in the front line after many years of exploration. This World Cup is destined to become the stage for Park Ji star and Honda Gyu to play. After scoring in the first game, Park Ji star became the core force of the South Korean team in the next game. Even when he fell behind, the South Koreans still bravely moved forward under the leadership of Park Ji. The Japanese teenager Honda Gyu became the soul of the Japanese team. His delicate footwork and the fight in the front court made the world learn about the power of Asia. In this World Cup, Asia has 4.5 participants. The four teams that finally advanced to the top 32 have left an impression on the world. With the South Korean and Japanese teams breaking into the top 16, the AFC can justifiably ask the poor African Football Association for a place. Of course, if you want to compete with the world's top teams, Asian football still has many important things to do, such as refusing black whistles, refusing fake matches and other slogans that have been shouted for many years, but they still can not stop the adverse effects of gambling on Asian football. Asian football can not rely only on Japan and South Korea, but also the West Asian team and our China must catch up as soon as possible. Gui brother Gui brother's success is due to the luck of grouping, and on the other hand, it also relies on the team's overall strength. The Paraguayan team has always adhered to the advantage of team defense. In the four games, they lost only one goal. The excellent defense made all teams unattainable. In the next game, Paraguay will play against Spain. Faced with the powerful Spanish team, it will be crucial for Paraguay to continue their good defense. Compared with the whole team of Paraguay, Uruguay pays more attention to individual skills. The personal ability of Fran and Suarez will be the demon of Ghana's defense line. Of course, Uruguay's weak midfield control ability is likely to make them passive in the game. Of course, the two teams have a great advantage in this World Cup, that is, many of their players are from their own league. Because the burden of European professional leagues is too heavy, many big players are injured before the game. Moreover, the European league is not over until half a month before the World Cup. Therefore, for European players, physical and mental fatigue make the South American team more exciting in this game. Eagle style No one expected Maradona and his Argentina to have a smooth ride in this World Cup. In the view of the outside world, this coach, who is super first class in football, third class in character and non first class in coaching"

豪格否认奔驰考虑撤离F1未来规则将决定三叉星去留新浪体育讯　奔驰汽车运动主管罗伯特-豪格辟谣，否认奔驰可能因迈凯轮“伪证门”事件撤出F1。本周三德国媒体《stuttgarter-zeitung》在一篇采访戴姆勒监事会成员HelmutLense的报道中中分析指出，迫于全球低迷的汽车产业现状，外加迈凯轮可能因“伪证门”事件遭到FIA的进一步处罚。迈凯轮车队40%的大股东奔驰可能撤出F1。今天在巴林，三叉星的汽车主管诺伯特-豪格对此予以了否认。“有些人暗示奔驰会退出F1。NO，奔驰不会退出。”豪格周五在巴林对《汽车运动》说道。但德国人承认如今的产业现状，的确使得汽车厂商的参赛行为存在不确定性。“当然，每一个诚实的人都在考虑当前的情况，这是事实。我们的赞助行为，的确始终存在不确定。我无法预知汽车行业在未来两个月、三个月、四个月或者五个月会发生什么、没法预知行业情况是否会好转。但如果你的车卖的多了，那你的情况肯定就会更好。”豪格分析说道。随后他指出，决定奔驰是否长期效忠F1并非人们热议的“伪证门”事件，而是F1未来几年是套怎样的规则，特别F1可能引入预算帽的问题。“当前，一切完全照旧。媒体的理解是——只要你面临FIA的听证会，那他们就会认为你的将来会陷入疑问。但是普遍的观点是、我们首先需要意识到的一点是：汽车工业的整体经济形势。”“当人问我能否保证未来5年奔驰依旧效忠F1，这是不可能有的承诺。更重要的在于，我们是否能否找到一套规则，限制也好、预算帽也好，如果是可能的，那就能带来帮助。”“这需要FOTA和FIA联手共同协商，需要大家都把它放在心上，这是非常严肃的现实问题，绝不容许有丝毫的懈怠、敷衍塞责。现在的问题是不是讨论扩散器、用不用KERS的，所有参赛者应该考虑重要的事。”豪格接着说道。(行云)	罗伯特-豪格,诺伯特-豪格,行云,HelmutLense	正向	"Haug denied that Mercedes is considering withdrawing from F1. The future rules will determine the fate of the three-pointed star. Sina Sports News Mercedes Robert Haug, the chief of Mercedes-Benz Automobile Sports, denied that Mercedes-Benz might withdraw from F1 due to the ""false evidence gate"" incident of McLaren. On Wednesday, the German media ""Stuttgarter-Zeitung"" analyzed in an interview with Daimler's supervisory board member Helmut Lens that due to the global depressed automobile industry, coupled with the fact that McLaren may be further punished by the FIA due to the ""fake evidence gate"" incident. Mercedes, a 40% major shareholder of McLaren, may withdraw from F1. Today in Bahrain, Norbert Haug, the head of the three-pointed star car, denied this. ""Some people suggest that Mercedes will withdraw from F1. No, Mercedes will not quit."" Haug said to Autosport in Bahrain on Friday. But the German admitted that the current industrial situation did make the participation of automobile manufacturers uncertain. ""Of course, everyone who is honest is considering the current situation, which is a fact. Our sponsorship behavior is indeed always uncertain. I can't predict what will happen in the automobile industry in the next two months, three months, four months or five months, or whether the industry situation will improve. But if your car sells more, you will definitely be better off."" Haug analyzed. Then he pointed out that it was not the ""false evidence gate"" event that people were热议about whether Mercedes would be loyal to F1 for a long time, but what rules F1 will have in the future, especially the budget cap that F1 may introduce. ""At present, everything is as usual. The media's understanding is - as long as you face the hearing of the FIA, they will think that your future will be in question. But the general view is, and the first thing we need to realize is: the overall economic situation of the automobile industry."" ""When people ask me if I can guarantee that Mercedes will remain loyal to F1 for the next five years, there is no promise. More importantly, it lies in whether we can find a set of rules, restrictions or budget caps. If it is possible, it will bring help."" ""This requires FOTA and FIA to join hands to negotiate. Everyone needs to put it in their hearts. This is a very serious reality that must not be allowed to slack off or shirk responsibility in the slightest. Now the problem is not to discuss the diffuser or not to use KERS. All participants should consider important things."" Haug added. (Cloud)"

Later, the family returned home to have the New Year's dinner, mother in law and daughter in law are in the same heart! After marriage, Bach still has a lot of money. He not only wears a Cartier (listening to music) diamond watch worth 300000 yuan, but also carries a new Balenciage color grid bag and gives away a hundred yuan. Continue to be generous! Devora only returned to Hong Kong from Thailand the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Zhang Ziyi could not wait to take Lucas to have tea and go shopping with his mother in law. He was very smart! At about 3:00 pm yesterday, Bach and Lagu appeared in the Land Plaza in Central China. Lucas, dressed in a trendy fashion, was very fierce. He not only climbed up and down, but also often played with the toy car in his hand. As for Zhang Ziyi, who wears a pair of sunglasses and is equally popular, she is very surprising. She wears a black and red coat, steps on a bright yellow Dr. Martens, wears a Cartier diamond watch worth 300000 yuan, carries a new Balenciage MotorcycleWorkBag worth 23800 yuan on her hand, and often gives restaurant staff a very sexy gift! Although it is reported that Zhang Ziyi is pregnant for several months, what we saw yesterday was that she still ordered frozen juice, which is very suspicious. At about 4:00 p.m., Bach and Grandma turned to Louis Vuitton to see the bag. Zhang Ziyi, who originally had Lucas in his hand, handed his son to the Filipino maid when he saw the dazzling bag, and then he kept chatting with his grandma about the bag that he liked. The reporter congratulated her and she said politely, ""We are buying things, and we will take photos for you later."" Shortly afterwards, Bach stepped out of the famous store to let the reporters take photos, and then took out the hundred yuan lucky money printed with the word ""thank you"" to give away to people who were very generous! Later, she held Lucas and got on a seven seater car. Some reporters asked her about the rumors of her pregnancy, but she only responded with a smile. On the contrary, Lagu happily said that she was very happy to see her grandson, and then they returned to the Love Building together. As far as I know, they had a dinner with Liming and others at home last night. After that, the reporter called Grandma Lagu for an interview. Whenever she mentioned Lucas, she laughed: ""Lucas asked for a lot of lucky money this year, too much to count! In fact, on the first day of the New Year, the three of them have already paid New Year's greetings to me early."" However, when asked whether Zhang Ziyi would have another child for Xie's family, she hung up in a hurry after laughing four times. (Li Li/Wen)"

The police launched a rapid investigation after receiving the report and arrested three suspects who committed crimes across provinces 12 hours later. Recently, the Huangpu Procuratorate approved the arrest of the criminal suspects Kong Mou, Li Mou, and Tang Mou on the charge of kidnapping. Kong Mou is an unemployed person in Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province. In order to make money, he colluded with his fellow countrymen Li Mou and Tang Mou to plan a kidnapping. Kong provided his friend Mr. Li, who is engaged in architectural engineering, with family information and address, while Li and Tang used the funds he provided to purchase baseball caps, cloth covers, sealing tapes, fruit knives, anesthetic sprays, false Shanghai license plates and other criminal tools in advance, and rented a black car. Since September 12 this year, Li and Tang have repeatedly waited at Mr. Li's residence to wait for an opportunity to kidnap his wife, but they did not find an opportunity to do so. Later, the three people decided to transfer to his son Xiaojie (pseudonym), who is studying in a middle school in Shanghai. At around 6:45 a.m. on November 12, Li and Tang drove to the gate of a bank on South Zhongshan Road. When Xiaojie passed there on his way to school, Tang first pretended to ask for help and chatted, and sprayed anesthetics on his face. Li immediately held a knife and forced Xiaojie to get in the car. The two men blindfolded Xiao Jie with a black ribbon prepared in advance, tied his hands and feet with sealing tape, and then put him into the trunk of the car and left Shanghai. Then, the two people called to tear the ticket as a threat and asked Xiao Jie's parents for a ransom of 10 million yuan. After receiving the report, the police immediately launched an investigation, locked the location of the suspect, and then launched a rapid attack. Twelve hours later, they successfully rescued the hostage in Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, and arrested Kong and other three people.

小学教师强奸猥亵多名女童被执行死刑中新网南阳9月16日电(吴扬曹萌张庆江)今天下午，河南南阳市中级人民法院遵照最高人民法院院长签发的执行死刑命令，依法将当地强奸、猥亵儿童的小学教师刘翔宇验明正身，押赴刑场执行死刑。据调查，2008年上学期及2009年下学期，刘翔宇利用担任南阳市宛城区红泥湾镇某小学班主任之便，在教室分别对多名6—9岁的女学生进行奸淫、猥亵，甚至在上课期间多次将女生叫到讲台上进行猥亵。2010年7月5日，南阳市中级人民法院一审认定被告人刘翔宇犯强奸罪，判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身；犯猥亵儿童罪，判处有期徒刑十三年，决定执行死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。刘翔宇不服，提出上诉。河南省高级人民法院经过二审，裁定驳回上诉，维持原判，并提请最高人民法院核准。最高人民法院经复核认为，被告人刘翔宇利用教师身份，多次在教室等公共场所对多名幼女进行奸淫，并致一人重伤，罪行极其严重，应依法从重处罚。一审判决，二审裁定准确适当，遂核准河南省高级人民法院对被告人刘翔宇作出的维持一审判决的刑事裁定。刘翔宇强奸、猥亵儿童案曾备受社会各界关注，网友将其评论为“最不要脸的老师”“禽兽老师”。	刘翔宇,张庆江,吴扬,曹萌	负向	"The primary school teacher who raped and molested many girls was sentenced to death. China News Network, Nanyang, September 16 (Wu Yang Caomeng Zhang Qingjiang) This afternoon, the intermediate people's court of Nanyang City, Henan Province, in accordance with the death penalty execution order signed by the President of the Supreme People's Court, legally verified Liu Xiangyu, a primary school teacher in the local area who raped and molested children, and sent him to the execution ground to carry out the death penalty. According to the investigation, in the first semester of 2008 and the second semester of 2009, Liu Xiangyu took advantage of his position as the head teacher of a primary school in Hongniwan Town, Wancheng District, Nanyang City, and raped and molested several female students aged 6-9 in the classroom, and even called girls to the podium for molestation during the class. On July 5, 2010, the Intermediate People's Court of Nanyang City found the defendant Liu Xiangyu guilty of rape and sentenced him to death, depriving him of his political rights for life; He was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment for the crime of molesting children, and he was sentenced to death and deprived of his political rights for life. Liu Xiangyu was not convinced and appealed. After the second instance of the Higher People's Court of Henan Province, it was ruled to reject the appeal and maintain the original judgment, and to submit it to the Supreme People's Court for approval. After review, the Supreme People's Court considered that the defendant Liu Xiangyu used his teacher's status to rape several young girls in public places such as classrooms many times, causing one person to be seriously injured, and his crime was extremely serious, so he should be punished according to law. The first instance judgment and the second instance ruling were accurate and appropriate, so the criminal ruling made by the Higher People's Court of Henan Province to the defendant Liu Xiangyu to maintain the first instance judgment was approved. Liu Xiangyu's case of raping and molesting children has received great attention from all sectors of society, and netizens commented him as ""the most shameless teacher"" and ""beast teacher""."
托雷斯放言愿破利物浦球门他切尔西战袍1天狂售2万件新浪体育讯　冬季转会窗关闭当天，切尔西给托雷斯开出的5000万英镑报价终于被利物浦接受，很快切尔西官方就宣布西班牙前锋正式加盟球队。这出由球员本人在似乎毫无征兆的情况下，递交转会申请而引发的转会肥皂剧终于尘埃落定。事后《每日邮报》披露，托雷斯本人早在去年就萌生了离开球队的想法。托雷斯本人透露：“在去年夏天，我就在思考是不是得离开了，因为我希望自己的职业生涯能更进一步，以实现自己作为职业球员的抱负。切尔西这样的球队，每个赛季都能去角逐各个锦标，特别是英超冠军和欧冠的冠军，当这样的球队希望你加盟时，你不可能去拒绝。“对于他的抱负理想，很多利物浦球迷就不是那么买账了。在托雷斯转会的消息确认之后，部分激进的利物浦球迷甚至选择焚烧他的9号球衣来示威。不久之后利物浦将在主场迎战切尔西，至于在比赛中球迷们将会给托雷斯怎样的待遇，就不得而知了。面对愤怒的利物浦球迷，托雷斯这样说：“和我当初从马德里竞技转投利物浦一样，就好像天命，我只是遵循它所以选择离开。我从来没有也绝不会说任何利物浦的坏话，现在我为切尔西效力了，我定当为球队竭尽全力。”托雷斯还表示，自己迫切希望在接下来对阵利物浦的比赛中能够登场亮相，而且能够在这场比赛中取得进球，不过他将不会庆祝，以示对前东家的尊重。谈到自己即将在切尔西开始的新生活，托雷斯谈到：“我无疑是来到了一个伟大的集体之中——特里，兰帕德，德罗巴，他们一个个全都是响当当的大人物，我相信自己也会成为他们中的一分子。我会努力做好工作，认真训练，不断进球，融入到集体中。在此我还要感谢切尔西俱乐部，因为这让我拥有了更上一层楼的机会。”此外，前利物浦队友贝纳永也会帮助托雷斯尽快的与新队友们打成一片。“我和贝纳永以前就是很好的朋友，能再和他一起踢球我十分高兴，我希望他能尽快从伤病中恢复过来，同样我也很期待和新朋友们的见面。”几乎在他加盟球队的同时，切尔西球迷商店就立即推出了印有托雷斯名字的9号队服，50英镑一件的球服甚至在官方最终确认转会之前就卖出了2万多件。他的到来，无疑已经在切尔西球迷中掀起了一股托雷斯浪潮，无数球迷为他的加盟而欣喜若狂。对于新援，主帅安切洛蒂也有话要说：“我迫不及待地想要立马见到他们，他们的到来对于球队是梦幻般的事件。”一前一后两员大将的加盟，使得意大利人手里的牌更好了，究竟切尔西能不能在最后阶段奋起直追，夺下英超冠军的奖杯，我们拭目以待。(阿韦多)	安切洛蒂,托雷斯,贝纳永,阿韦多,德罗巴,兰帕德,特里	正向	"Torres said he was willing to break the Liverpool goal. His Chelsea jersey sold 20000 pieces in one day. Sina Sports News On the day when the winter transfer window closed, Chelsea's 50 million pound offer to Torres was finally accepted by Liverpool, and soon the Chelsea official announced that the Spanish striker had officially joined the team. The transfer soap opera triggered by the player himself, who seemed to have no signs, has finally settled. Later, the Daily Mail revealed that Torres himself had the idea of leaving the team as early as last year. Torres revealed: ""Last summer, I thought I had to leave, because I hope my career can go further to achieve my ambition as a professional football player. Chelsea is such a team that can compete for various championships every season, especially the Premier League championship and the Champions League championship. When such a team wants you to join, you can't refuse."" Many Liverpool fans didn't buy his ambitions. After the confirmation of Torres's transfer, some radical Liverpool fans even chose to burn his No. 9 shirt to demonstrate. It is unknown what treatment the fans will give to Torres in the game when Liverpool will play against Chelsea at home soon. Facing the angry Liverpool fans, Torres said: ""Like when I moved from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool, it seems like fate. I just follow it, so I choose to leave. I never have and never will say any bad words about Liverpool. Now that I have played for Chelsea, I will do my best for the team."" Torres also said that he was eager to play in the next game against Liverpool and score in this game, but he would not celebrate to show respect for his former employer. Speaking of his new life in Chelsea, Torres said: ""Undoubtedly, I have come to a great group - Terry, Lampard, Drogba, they are all big names, I believe I will become one of them. I will try to do my job well, train seriously, keep scoring and integrate into the group. Here, I would like to thank Chelsea Club, because it gives me the opportunity to go to a higher level."" In addition, the former Liverpool teammate Benayong will also help Torres get along well with his new teammates as soon as possible. ""Benayong and I were good friends before, and I am very happy to play with him again. I hope he can recover from his injury as soon as possible, and I also look forward to meeting new friends."" Almost as soon as he joined the team, the Chelsea fans' store immediately launched the No. 9 team uniform with Torres' name on it. The 50 pound team uniform even sold more than 20000 pieces before the official confirmation of the transfer. His arrival has undoubtedly set off a Torres wave among Chelsea fans, and countless fans are ecstatic about his joining. The coach Ancelotti also has something to say about the new aid: ""I can't wait to see them immediately. Their coming is a dream event for the team."" The joining of two generals at the beginning and end of the team has made the cards in the hands of the Italians better. Whether Chelsea can make a comeback in the final stage and win the Premier League championship trophy, we will wait and see. (Avado)"
曼联中场一大弱点成为命门若非意外和运气红魔靠什么记者寒冰评述利物浦没有杰拉德，曼联没有弗莱彻，两个中场的缺失让比赛的天平发生了微妙变化。贝尼特斯和弗格森各自都是不变应万变，吉格斯出现在左路负责串联前场，但因为利物浦的中场抢球能力过于强大，整个上半场吉格斯几乎没有几次致命的直传。托雷斯和技术出众的贝纳永主攻右路，曼联的攻势也从吉格斯一侧转移到瓦伦西亚的右翼。不过，因为缺少了吉格斯的发挥，鲁尼和贝尔巴托夫在前场几乎哑火，这也是整个上半场曼联居然只有2脚射门的根本原因。利物浦的问题同样在于库伊特无法替代杰拉德，右路的贝纳永突破和传中都有特点，但在托雷斯已拉开空当的前提下，库伊特把握机会能力非常一般。于是更多情况下，托雷斯甚至开始尝试在边路突破带球，但中路没有接应的痼疾让红军没有实质性的威胁。下半场曼联在攻势上的乏术愈加凸显，助攻能力差的奥谢死守后场，而一味突入底线传中的瓦伦西亚有勇无谋。双后腰的效果方面，马斯切拉诺和卢卡斯的组合远胜卡里克和斯科尔斯，吉格斯得球机会少，也就无法向锋线提供帮助。第65分钟，曼联为自己在进攻上的无能付出了必然的代价，费迪南德和维迪奇的组合在速度上根本无法与托雷斯竞争，托雷斯的进球只是时间问题。曼联在控球时间上略多，但真正能在禁区内找到空间的传球寥寥。相反，贝纳永在杰拉德缺席下的作用，是几乎镜像位置的吉格斯无法比拟的。10分钟后，弗格森拿出了自己的战术变化：欧文出场与鲁尼搭档强调速度，纳尼换下斯科尔斯代替吉格斯拉边，吉格斯则回到中路串联攻防。吉格斯个人技术突出，尤其是纳尼在左路的突破很有效果。体能下降的红军终于遇到了真正的问题，贝尼特斯此时只是用高大的锋线小将恩戈格换下带伤上阵体能不佳的托雷斯。弗格森孤注一掷的前场5人组进攻搭档，给主动收缩防守的利物浦制造了极大的麻烦。不过，显然贝尼特斯安排贝纳永和库伊特，在反击中的优势远大于曼联。最后时刻的20分钟里，面对红军摆出的铁桶阵，曼联在进攻上的想象力匮乏让他们付出了最惨重的代价。维迪奇和马斯切拉诺的红牌，并没有影响两支球队的战术布置。至于最后时刻恩戈格的进球，缺少了维迪奇的曼联根本无法阻挡。至少在安菲尔德，贝尼特斯的451在中场建立的强大优势，让弗格森本就缺乏想象力的攻击线无从下口。没有C·罗纳尔多的曼联，的确非常不同。假若没有“弗格森时间”和运气的照顾，曼联根本走不到如今的排名。	欧文,托雷斯,吉格斯,贝尼特斯,卢卡斯,C·罗纳尔多,弗莱彻,贝纳永,奥谢,瓦伦西亚,恩戈格,维迪奇,费迪南德,马斯切拉诺,贝尔巴托夫,库伊特,C罗,杰拉德,鲁尼,斯科尔斯,弗格森,纳尼,卡里克	正向	"A major weakness of Manchester United's midfield has become a life goal. If it is not unexpected and lucky, what does the Red Devils rely on? The reporter, Han Bing, commented that Liverpool had no Gerrard and Manchester United had no Fletcher. The loss of the two midfielders made a subtle change to the balance of the game. Benitez and Ferguson each不变应万变，Giggs appeared on the left to connect the front court, but because Liverpool's midfield ball grabbing ability was too strong, Giggs hardly made several fatal straight passes in the whole first half. Torres and the technologically outstanding Benayun mainly attacked the right flank, and Manchester United's attack also shifted from Giggs to Valencia's right wing. However, because of the lack of Giggs' performance, Rooney and Berbatov almost lost their voice in the front court, which was the fundamental reason why Manchester United had only two shots in the entire first half. Liverpool's problem is also that Kuyt can not replace Gerrard. Benayong on the right road has the characteristics of breaking and crossing, but under the premise that Torres has opened up space, Kuyt's ability to grasp opportunities is very average. As a result, in more cases, Torres even began to try to break and dribble on the flank, but the chronic problem that there was no response in the middle court made the Red Army have no substantive threat. In the second half, United's lack of strategy in the attack became more prominent. O'Shea, who was poor in assisting, was determined to stay in the back court, and Valencia, who was brave but unwise, was determined to break into the baseline to pass the ball. In terms of the effect of double waist, the combination of Mascherano and Lucas is far better than that of Carrick and Scholes. Giggs has few opportunities to get the ball, so he can not provide help to the front line. In the 65th minute, Manchester United paid the inevitable price for their inability to attack. The combination of Ferdinand and Vidic was totally unable to compete with Torres in speed. Torres' goal was just a matter of time. Manchester United had slightly more possession of the ball, but there were few passes that could really find space in the restricted area. On the contrary, the role of Benayong in the absence of Gerrard is incomparable to Giggs, which is almost a mirror position. Ten minutes later, Ferguson made his tactical change: Owen played with Rooney to emphasize speed, Nani replaced Scholes with Giggs to pull the side, and Giggs returned to the middle to connect the attack and defense. Giggs' personal technology is prominent, especially Nani's breakthrough on the left is very effective. The physically declining Red Army finally met with a real problem. At this time, Benitez just replaced Torres, who played with his injuries and poor physical fitness, with the tall forward youngster Ngog. Ferguson's desperate five man group of attacking partners in the front court caused a lot of trouble to Liverpool, which was actively contracting to defend. However, it is obvious that Benitez's arrangement of Benayong and Kuyt has far more advantages than Manchester United in counter attack. In the last 20 minutes, facing the iron bucket formation put forward by the Red Army, the lack of imagination of Manchester United in the attack made them pay the heaviest price. Vidic's and Mascherano's red cards did not affect the tactical deployment of the two teams. As for Ngog's goal at the last minute, Manchester United, which lacked Vidic, could not stop it at all. At least in Anfield, Benitez's strong advantage in the midfield established by 451 has made Ferguson's attack line, which is short of imagination, unable to compete. Manchester United, without Cristiano Ronaldo, is indeed very different. If there is no ""Ferguson Time"" and luck, Manchester United would never have reached the current ranking."

张涵予新《水浒》显英气前额金线若隐若现(图)新浪娱乐讯新版《水浒传》目前拍摄正酣，剧中主要角色及定妆照陆续曝光，一众新梁山好汉引来广泛关注。而张涵予版的宋江也网友被赞为最真实的一个，英雄气质不说，就连草莽气场也有几分相似。而在最新的一组剧照中，张涵予前额画上去的金线若隐若现，更是将宋江文武英气表现的淋漓尽致。刚柔并济英气逼人从发布参演新版《水浒传》的消息到电视剧热拍，“花围巾”事件受到网友的质疑，而对于张涵予饰演的“宋江”却受到网友的一致好评，制作方更是从一开始就认准张涵予是饰演宋江的不二人选，新浪娱乐独家采访到新版《水浒》制片方，其表示：“张涵予本身具有梁山好汉身上的草莽气，还有有独特的文雅气质，而这也是他的魅力之处。”而最近拍摄的夺东平一集中，张涵予手握书卷的造型也将宋江特有的身份和气势展现出来。“宋江很真实”新版《水浒传》中，由张涵予饰演宋江，就定妆照来看，外形与原著很贴近。张涵予的精湛演技自然无需担心，只是有报道称素以硬汉形象闻名的张涵予表示要将宋江演成英雄。与张涵予有很多对手戏的李宗翰表示：张涵予的造型和我脑海中的宋江无异。外形十分贴近原著，一眼看过去，他不是张涵予，他就是宋江。进剧组以来，我与涵予对手戏最多。在很多片场我们一起看拍摄片段，在那一刻，我看到了一个特别真实，非常人性化的宋江。以涵予的演技来说，他扮演的宋江是具有他个人特色的。	张涵予,李宗翰,宋江	正向	"Zhang Han Yu's new ""Water Margin"" shows a heroic forehead with a gold line faintly visible (picture) Sina Entertainment News The new version of ""Water Margin"" is being shot in full swing. The main roles and make-up photos in the play have been gradually exposed, and a group of new Liangshan heroes have attracted wide attention. Zhang Han Yu's version of Song Jiang was also praised by netizens as the most realistic one. I won't say anything about the hero's气质, but even the grassland atmosphere is somewhat similar. In the latest set of publicity photos, the golden line drawn on Zhang Han Yu's forehead is faintly visible, which shows Song Jiang's literary and military hero spirit to the fullest. The gentle and aggressive English spirit forced people to release the news of participating in the new version of ""Water Margin"" from the hot shooting of the TV play. The ""flower scarf"" incident has been questioned by netizens. However, Zhang Han Yu's role of ""Song Jiang"" has won unanimous praise from netizens. The producer has identified Zhang Han Yu as the only choice for Song Jiang from the beginning. Sina Entertainment exclusively interviewed the producer of the new version of ""Water Margin"", who said: ""Zhang Han Yu has the grass and莽气质of Liangshan's good guys on his body, and his unique elegance, which is also his charm."" In the recent shooting of the battle for Dongping, Zhang Han Yu's holding of the book roll also shows Song Jiang's special identity and momentum. ""Song Jiang is very realistic"" In the new version of ""Water Margin"", Zhang Han Yu plays Song Jiang. Judging from the make-up photo, the appearance is very close to the original work. There is no need to worry about Zhang Han Yu's excellent acting skills. However, it is reported that Zhang Han Yu, who is known for his tough guy image, said he would play Song Jiang as a hero. Li Zonghan, who has many opposite plays with Zhang Hanxu, said: Zhang Hanxu's shape is no different from Song Jiang in my mind. The appearance is very close to the original work. At first sight, he is not Zhang Han Yu, but Song Jiang. Since I joined the crew, I have had the most plays with Han Yu. We watched the shooting clips together on many film sets. At that moment, I saw a particularly true and very humanized Song Jiang. In terms of acting skills, the Song Jiang he plays has his personal characteristics."
地量未必地价欧美隐忧恐拖累A股《红周刊》特约作者民族证券徐一钉本周五，A股市场成交量为1051亿元，再创本轮调整的地量。地量以后是地价？未必！6月20日，A股市场成交1101亿元，创出本轮调整的地量，虽然出现2610点至2826点或8.27%的反弹，但随后上证综指又创出2437点的新低。温家宝总理日前表示：经济放缓没超预期，宏观调控取向不能变。透视出很多机构所期待的货币政策结构性微调可能延后，资金不足依然是制约A股强力反弹的最主要因素之一。今年上半年，沪深两市2244家上市公司共实现营业收入10.13万亿元，同比增长25.78%；实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润9943.30亿元，同比增长22.31%。而去年上半年，1947家上市公司实现归属于上市公司股东的净利润7849.89亿元，同比增长41.17%。今年上半年上市公司净利润增长比去年明显放缓。值得关注的是，今年上半年，16家上市银行共实现净利润4610.88亿元，同比增长34.27%，上半年16家银行净利润占2244家上市公司净利润的46.37%。如果剔除银行，余下的2228家上市公司实现净利润5332.42%，同比仅增长13.56%。显然，16家银行出色的业绩掩盖了余下的2228家上市公司净利润大幅下滑。上半年，上市公司毛利率降1.3个百分点，主要原因是通胀加剧以及信贷环境紧缩导致的原材料、人力、融资等综合成本上升，正在大幅侵蚀上市公司的利润率。笔者预计，三季度上市公司净利润同比增长还将继续下滑。花旗银行最新报告指出，全球经济，特别是发达国家经济前景持续明显恶化。美银美林模型计算显示，根据最近费城联储和密西根大学的调查数据，美国经济衰退的概率已经超过80%，欧元区制造业采购经理人指数PMI从7月的50.4跌至8月份的49。其中，德国8月PMI由52跌至50.9，为2009年9月以来最低水平。而欧元区17个国家中，仅有德国、荷兰和奥地利三个国家仍保持在50以上，这是欧洲经济失去动力的又一迹象。值得关注的是，面对不佳的经济复苏前景，经济减速已取代通胀成为新兴市场主要的隐忧，部分新兴经济体货币政策已出现悄然松动，巴西央行本周三将基准利率下调0.5个百分点至12%。如果没有预期外的利好或利淡因素，沪市将维持在2500点～2600点区域弱平衡整理。虽然A股估值处于较低水平，沪深股市下跌动能似乎不足。笔者担忧，美国经济、或欧洲主权债务危机再起波澜，若此将打破目前多空弱平衡的格局。	徐一钉,温家宝	负向	The minimum volume of land does not necessarily mean that the land price in Europe and America is a hidden worry, which may drag down A-shares. Hong Kong Red Weekly, a special author of National Securities Xu Yiding On Friday, the trading volume of A-share market was 105.1 billion yuan, a record low of this round of adjustment. Is it the price of the land after the ground volume? Not necessarily! On June 20, the A-share market traded 110.1 billion yuan, a record low in this round of adjustment. Although there was a rebound of 2610 to 2826 or 8.27%, the Shanghai Stock Index then hit a new low of 2437 points. Premier Wen Jiabao recently said: The slowdown in the economy has not exceeded expectations, and the macro-control orientation cannot be changed. It reveals that the structural fine-tuning of monetary policy expected by many institutions may be delayed, and the lack of funds is still one of the main factors restricting the strong rebound of A-shares. In the first half of this year, 2244 listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen achieved operating income of 10.13 trillion yuan, an increase of 25.78%; The net profit attributable to the shareholders of the listed company was 994.33 billion yuan, an increase of 22.31%. In the first half of last year, 1947 listed companies achieved a net profit attributable to the shareholders of the listed company of 784.989 billion yuan, an increase of 41.17%. The growth of listed companies' net profit in the first half of this year has slowed significantly compared with last year. It is worth noting that in the first half of this year, 16 listed banks achieved a total profit of 461.088 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of 34.27%, and the net profit of 16 banks in the first half of the year accounted for 46.37% of the net profit of 2244 listed companies. If banks are excluded, the remaining 2228 listed companies achieved a net profit of 5332.42%, an increase of only 13.56% compared with the same period last year. Obviously, the outstanding performance of 16 banks has concealed the sharp decline of the remaining 2228 listed companies' net profits. In the first half of the year, the gross profit margin of listed companies decreased by 1.3 percentage points, mainly due to the fact that inflation and credit environment contraction led to the rise of comprehensive costs such as raw materials, manpower and financing, which is eroding the profit margin of listed companies. The author expects that the year-on-year growth of listed companies' net profit will continue to decline in the third quarter. Citibank's latest report pointed out that the global economic prospects, especially those of developed countries, continued to deteriorate significantly. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's model calculation shows that the probability of recession in the United States has exceeded 80% according to the recent survey data of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the University of Michigan, and the eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index PMI fell from 50.4 in July to 49 in August. Among them, Germany's PMI in August fell from 52 to 50.9, the lowest level since September 2009. Of the 17 countries in the eurozone, only Germany, the Netherlands and Austria still maintain above 50, which is another sign that the European economy is losing momentum. It is worth noting that in the face of the grim economic recovery prospects, economic deceleration has replaced inflation as the main hidden worry of the emerging market, and the monetary policies of some emerging economies have quietly eased. The Central Bank of Brazil cut the benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 12% this Wednesday. Without unexpected favorable or bad factors, the Shanghai Stock Exchange will maintain a weak balance in the range of 2500 ~ 2600 points. Although A-shares are at a low level, the decline of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets seems to be insufficient. The author is worried that another wave of US economic turmoil or European sovereign debt crisis will break the current pattern of weak balance between many people and many people.
美股评论：内线人士在抄底导读：虽然股市被日本的麻烦搅得心神不安，但是在上周，企业内线人士卖出股票的速度却突然减缓到了只有前一周的一半。投资通讯专家、MarketWatch专栏作家赫伯特(MarkHulbert)指出，这实际上是意味着内线人士恢复了信心，将混乱当作了入场的机会。以下即赫伯特的评论文章全文：原本看上去，市场似乎很快就要在内线人士股票抛售的压力之下遭受重创了，可就在这当口，内线人士们却撤退了。要知道，这样的事情，他们最近两年之间可干了远不止一次了，因此观察家们也就难免感到迷惑：他们是在和我们闹着玩么？具体的层面，我们先来了解一下内线人士在上周日本危机当中的反应。根据那些内线人士行为研究专家的看法，如果他们继续按照之前那样的速度出售自己公司的股票，就意味着一个超级不祥之兆已经出现在市场的眼前。所谓不祥之兆是指，这意味着他们对于自己公司股票价格在短期之内复原几乎没有什么信心。好在，他们事实上并没有那样做。想要了解真实的情况，我们可以参考一个内线人士上周售出与买进自己公司股票的比率——ArgusResearch发行的VickersWeeklyInsiderReport每周都会发布这一比率的最新版本。周一的最新一期通讯显示，内线人士售出买进比率上周大大降低，只有前一周的一半左右。根据Vickers提供的数据，这已经是比率去年9月以来的最低水平。InsiderInsights投资通讯编辑莫兰德(JonathanMoreland)对这一明显变化的解释是：“内线人士将过去一周的混乱看作是一个机会，他们抄底买进了。”去年的9月，即这一比率上一次如此之低的时候，道琼斯工业平均指数的点位大约是1万500点以下，较之现在低了近2000点。看涨者发现内线人士在市场前进了这么大一步之后还是类似的姿态，当然会非常高兴。《赫伯特金融摘要》所追踪的以内线人士行为为线索的投资通讯，在这一周都选择了增持。那么，他们建议自己的客户买进哪些股票？Vickers推荐了无线服务提供商USAMobility(USMO)。莫兰德推荐了三支股票，其中两支都是医药类股：LigandPharmaceuticals(LGND)和ThresholdPharmaceuticals(THLD)。莫兰德的第三个推荐是UraniumResources(URRE)。他表示，这是个“让人极度紧张的”选择，因为该股在日本核危机期间价格暴跌。不过，如果你想要追踪内线人士的做法，那么你的策略就不可能不让人紧张，因为和所有的逆势分析策略一样，这一策略往往都会要我们买进那些不被多数人看好的股票。(子衿)	赫伯特,子衿,JonathanMoreland,MarkHulbert,莫兰德	正向	"Comment on US stocks: Insiders are copying the bottom guide: Although the stock market is troubled by Japan, the speed of insiders selling stocks suddenly slowed down to only half of the previous week last week. Herbert, an investment communication expert and MarketWatch columnist (MarkHulbert), pointed out that this actually means that insiders have regained confidence and regard chaos as an opportunity to enter the market. The following is Herbert's complete comment article: Originally, it seemed that the market was going to suffer a heavy blow under the pressure of insiders' stock sales, but at this juncture, the insiders withdrew. It is worth noting that they have done far more than once in the past two years, so observers can not help but feel confused: are they playing with us? At a specific level, let's first understand the reaction of insiders to the Japanese crisis last week. According to the experts who study the behavior of insiders, if they continue to sell their company's stocks at the same speed as before, it means that a super ominous sign has appeared in front of the market. The so-called omen means that they have little confidence in the recovery of their company's stock price in the short term. Fortunately, they did not do that. If we want to know the real situation, we can refer to the ratio of insiders' selling and buying of their company's stocks last week - ArgusResearch's VickersWeeklyInsiderReport publishes the latest version of this ratio every week. The latest issue of the newsletter on Monday showed that the insider sell buy ratio last week fell significantly, only about half of the previous week. According to the data provided by Vickers, this is the lowest level of the ratio since last September. Jonathan Moreland, editor of the InsiderInsights investment newsletter, explained the obvious change: ""Insiders saw last week's chaos as an opportunity, and they bought at the bottom."" In September last year, that is, when the ratio was last so low, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was less than 1500 points, nearly 2000 points lower than now. Bullish people will be very happy to find that insiders are still similar after the market has taken such a big step forward. The investment newsletter tracked by Herbert Financial Summary, which focuses on the behavior of insiders, has chosen to increase its holdings this week. So, what stocks do they suggest their customers buy? Vickers recommended USAMobility (USMO), a wireless service provider. Moreland recommended three stocks, two of which were pharmaceutical stocks: Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) and Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD). Moreland's third recommendation is UraniumResources (URRE). He said that this is an ""extremely nerve racking"" choice because the stock price fell sharply during Japan's nuclear crisis. However, if you want to follow the practice of insiders, your strategy will inevitably make people nervous, because like all counter trend analysis strategies, this strategy often requires us to buy stocks that are not favored by the majority of people.

亚太松下公开赛首日比赛因天气取消比赛减至54洞新浪体育讯　北京时间9月23日消息，由于受到恶劣天气的影响，亚巡赛与日巡赛共同认可的亚太松下公开赛第一轮比赛被迫取消，本来四轮72洞的比赛因此压缩至三天(周五至周日)54洞比赛。总奖金约为170万美元的亚太松下公开赛本来今天早上在日本神户兵库县六甲国际高尔夫俱乐部东球场(RokkoKokusaiGolfClubEastCourse)开打。可是，在球手们打了25分钟后，赛事的裁判因为大风大雨的天气吹响了汽笛，在7点25分暂停比赛。随着风雨相加的势头没有减弱，赛事的裁判随后在10点取消了当天的比赛，表示本届赛事将会缩减至54洞。这样，第一轮比赛将于周五举行，依旧按照之前的开球时间进行。在周六打完36洞之后，比赛将产生晋级决赛的球手，然后在周日举行最后一轮的比赛。按照天气预报，兵库县在随后几天的天气将会放晴。亚巡赛赛事主管JittisakTamprasert说：“在审议之后，赛事组委会决定取消第一天的比赛，因为这样的状况无法举行比赛。亚太松下公开赛现在将进行三轮比赛，第一轮比赛将在周五早上重新开始。”这是亚巡赛连续第二周因为天气影响将比赛缩减至54洞。上周，在宝岛台湾林口国际高尔夫俱乐部举行的亚巡赛新赛事--仰德TPC高尔夫球公开赛因为在周日遭遇台风天气的影响，不得不同样将比赛缩减至54洞。本届亚太松下公开赛吸引了众多亚巡赛和日巡赛高手参赛，包括了2007年亚巡赛奖金王梁文冲、目前领先亚巡赛奖金榜的19岁韩国小将卢乘烈以及上赛季日巡赛奖金王石川辽。他们都是本周的夺冠热门人选，其中中国名将梁文冲在去年的亚太松下公开赛上获得了并列第2名，只输给了冠军丸山大辅(DaisukeMaruyama)。另外，来自福建的吴阿顺则第一次参加亚太松下公开赛。(罗毅)	JittisakTamprasert,石川辽,罗毅,梁文冲,卢乘烈,丸山大辅,吴阿顺	负向	"The first day's competition of the Asia Pacific Panasonic Open was cancelled due to weather. The competition was reduced to 54 holes Sina Sports News On September 23, Beijing time, the first round of the Asia Pacific Panasonic Open, which was jointly recognized by the Asian Tour and the Japanese Tour, was forced to cancel the originally four rounds of 72 hole competition due to the impact of bad weather, and was compressed to 54 holes (Friday to Sunday) for three days. The Asia Pacific Panasonic Open, with a total prize money of about 1.7 million dollars, was originally scheduled to start this morning at the East Course of Rokko Kokusai Golf Club, Hyogo, Kobe, Japan. However, after 25 minutes of play by the players, the referee of the event blew the whistle because of the windy and rainy weather, and the game was suspended at 7:25. With the trend of wind and rain adding up unabated, the event's referee cancelled the game on the same day at 10 o'clock, saying that the game would be shortened to 54 holes. As a result, the first round will be held on Friday, still in accordance with the previous starting time. After playing 36 holes on Saturday, the competition will generate players who will advance to the final, and then hold the last round of the competition on Sunday. According to the weather forecast, the weather in Hyogo Prefecture will clear up in the following days. Jittisak Tamprasert, event director of the Asian Tour, said: ""After deliberation, the event organizing committee decided to cancel the first day's event because such a situation could not hold the event. The Asia Pacific Panasonic Open will now have three rounds of competition, and the first round will restart on Friday morning."" This is the second consecutive week that the Asian Tour has reduced the competition to 54 holes due to weather. Last week, the new event of the Asian Tour - Yande TPC Golf Open, held at Linkou International Golf Club, Bao Island, Taiwan, had to reduce the competition to 54 holes due to the impact of typhoon weather on Sunday. The Asia Pacific Panasonic Open has attracted many experts from the Asian Tour and the Japanese Tour, including Liang Wenchong, the 2007 Asian Tour prize king, Lu Chenglie, a 19 year old South Korean teenager who is currently leading the Asian Tour prize list, and Shi Chuan Liao, the prize winner of last season's Japanese Tour. They are all the top candidates for this week's championship.

即将挑战前期高点关注两会机会昨天，两市开盘后小幅震荡上扬，在地产、银行等权重板块的推动下，盘中最高一度越过2930点，逼近2月中旬及去年12月中旬的两波反弹高点。但终因市场缺乏领导力的领涨板块无功而返，最终以带上影线的小阳线报收，成交量亦出现明显放大，K线形态呈现冲高回落态势。总体来看，由于缺乏主流领涨热点，市场短期大幅上攻尚缺乏人气支持，后期仍以温和震荡为主。从盘中来看，前期领涨的高铁、重装、水利等品种无疑开始进入了震荡整理阶段，退潮迹象非常明显。而农业、水泥等板块则表现参差不齐，联动性较差，石墨烯更是曲高和寡，也很难调动起市场的人气。市场中已经形成各自为战的比较混乱的局面，绝大部分个股的走势取决于指数的波动。指数涨，则个股涨，指数跌，则个股跌。所以对于大多数投资者而言，目前尚无法判断明确的可中线操作的热点，只能采取耐心等待的策略。从外围环境来看，对市场有利因素较多。一方面，考虑到“两会”即将召开，市场会维持一个稳定运行的环境，大落的可能性不大。另一方面，国家重拳整治楼市的政策滞后效应开始逐渐显现，通胀压力相应得以缓解，货币政策对市场的威胁会有所减弱。当然，也有不利因素，典型的莫过于目前市场资金面仍然显得并不充裕，而即使通胀有所缓解，短期内资金面也不会有所改观。另外，国家对于提高直接融资比重的定调，多少会让人联想起主板市场的再度大规模扩容。综合起来看，外围环境对市场短期内维持稳定还是多少会提供一定的支持，而且“两会”期间可能出现的一些政策性利好，多少也会对市场构成一定刺激，造成局部热点的活跃。从技术上来看，市场在一个上有压力下有支撑的区域中运行。2950点上方压力明显，要想向上突破，需要主流领涨热点及成交量的配合；2700点下方支撑强劲，在无重大外部环境负面影响下轻易不会跌破。估计近期这种横向震荡局面仍会延续，以等待中线突破方向的明朗。从操作上来看，在大的突破方向明朗前，最为稳妥的操作策略是以逸待劳，需找那些近期涨幅不大、基本面没有问题的品种小仓位参与，等待反弹补涨机会，一旦出现一定涨幅，也要及时获利出局。对于受到突发性政策因素刺激而出现的短线热点，需要结合市场情况，亦需见好就收。和讯信息崔晓黎■观点组合●金证顾问盘中宽幅震荡利于消化压力昨日市场延续强势格局，继四连阳后，上证综指继续向前期高点英勇推进，盘中最高上摸至2931点，基本到达前期高点附近，深证成指走势更强，收盘已突破近期高点，并创出自去年11月12日以来的收盘新高，两市成交继续温和梯度放大，价升量增预示着增量资金正在逐步入场，利于后市股指继续走好。昨日下午盘中，股指出现剧烈波动，上证综指在攻至前期高点附近时出现连续跳水，但回落至2900点整数关口附近再获支撑回升。我们认为，前期股指在2920点附近连续震荡达6个交易日，积累了一定的套牢盘压力，股指在此位置出现震荡整理是合情合理的，而略带恐慌性的跳水，有利于清洗短线不稳定的获利盘筹码，有利于后市股指继续向上攻击。同时，这也从一个侧面反映出目前主力资金意在长远。●东海证券即将挑战前期高点昨日公布的经济先行指标PMI为52.2%，环比回落0.7个百分点，这也是连续第三个月回落，显示经济环比增速下滑，但我们认为，进入3月份之后，经济基本面将出现相对好转。首先，1月份新增贷款反弹，显示企业潜在投资需求较旺。我们认为随着货币供应量增速反弹，企业投资需求将显现。其次，房地产投资面临好转，我国有史以来最大规模保障性安居工程已经全面启动，这将极大弥补商品房投资下降的缺口。从昨日公布业绩的保利地产等地产股来看，动态市盈率将迅速下降到10倍以下，地产股的反弹动力已经日益强劲。再次，海外经济持续复苏。近期欧美经济先行指标显示海外经济复苏正在继续，虽然中东局势导致油价大涨，但目前并不会对世界经济复苏产生太大的负面影响，且目前中东局势已有趋于明朗的迹象。不出意外，近期紧张的国际局势即将缓解，外围市场已经开始持续回升，这些都将刺激A股随之反弹。预计近几个交易日市场将维持盘升格局，并择机向上突破前期高点2939点和2944点的压制。●北京股商震荡攀升更关注机会昨日大盘震荡上行，午后在银行板块冲高之后，出现快速跳水，尾盘在两油的推动下，股指收复了部分失地。从盘面上看，主力做局的痕迹较为明显，近期几次快速下杀，都伴随着成交量的瞬时放大，而后又有资金奋起接盘，推动股指继续向好。但昨日尾盘向上挑的主要动力来自权重股，再结合早盘部分资金出现净流出状态，说明部分涨幅较大的个股出现获利盘集中兑现的动作。因此，虽然后市中线趋势依然看好，但短期内板块分化的趋势会得到强化。我们认为，只要盘中出现能够赚钱的机会，就不应该成为操作的障碍，而且中线行情看好，出现大的系统性风险概率较小，激进的投资者可在新材料、水泥、农业等板块中寻找机会，稳健的投资者可继续控制仓位，等待明确的市场热点出现。	崔晓黎	正向	"The focus of the forthcoming challenge to the early high point is on the opportunities of the two conferences. Yesterday, the two cities opened slightly volatile and rose. Under the promotion of the weighted sectors such as real estate and banking, the highest point of the trading day once exceeded 2930 points, close to the two waves of rebound highs in mid February and mid December last year. However, due to the lack of leadership in the market, the leading rising plate returned without success. In the end, it ended with a small Yang line with a top shadow line. The trading volume also showed a significant increase, and the K-line trend showed a trend of retreating after rising. In general, due to the lack of mainstream leadership hot spots, the market still lacks the support of popularity for a short-term sharp attack, and it is still dominated by moderate volatility later. From the perspective of the market, the leading varieties such as high-speed rail, heavy equipment and water conservancy, which rose earlier, have undoubtedly entered the stage of shock consolidation, and the signs of recession are very obvious. The agricultural, cement and other sectors performed unevenly, with poor connectivity. Graphene is even more lonely, and it is also difficult to mobilize the popularity of the market. The market has formed a relatively chaotic situation of fighting on its own, and the trend of most stocks depends on the fluctuation of the index. If the index rises, the individual stocks will rise, and if the index falls, the individual stocks will fall. Therefore, for most investors, it is still impossible to judge the clear medium-line operation hotspot, and they can only adopt the strategy of waiting patiently. From the perspective of the peripheral environment, there are many favorable factors to the market. On the one hand, considering that the ""two sessions"" are going to be held, the market will maintain a stable operating environment, and there is little possibility of a big drop. On the other hand, the lagging effect of the national heavy fist to rectify the real estate market began to appear gradually, the inflation pressure was alleviated accordingly, and the threat of monetary policy to the market would be reduced. Of course, there are also adverse factors. Typically, the current market funds are still not abundant, and even if inflation is eased, the funds will not change in the short term. In addition, the state's decision to increase the proportion of direct financing will inevitably remind people of the large-scale expansion of the main board market again. In general, the peripheral environment will still provide some support for the market to maintain stability in the short term, and some policy benefits that may occur during the ""Two Sessions"" will also have a certain effect on the market and cause local hot spots to be active. Technically, the market is running in an area under pressure and support. The pressure above 2950 points is obvious. If you want to break through upward, you need the coordination of the mainstream leadership hotspot and the trading volume; The support below 2700 points is strong, and it is not easy to break below without significant negative impact from the external environment. It is estimated that this lateral volatile situation will still continue in the near future to wait for the clarification of the direction of the medium line breakthrough. In terms of operation, before the major breakthrough direction is clear, the most stable operation strategy is to wait and see, and we need to find those varieties with small recent growth and no fundamental problems to participate in small positions, waiting for the rebound to make up the price. Once a certain increase appears, we should also take profits in time. For the short-term hotspot caused by the stimulation of sudden policy factors, we also need to combine the market situation and stop when it is good. Cui Xiaoli of Hexun Information ▪ Portfolio ● Jinneng Advisory The wide range of shocks in the market yesterday was conducive to digesting pressure. The market continued the strong pattern yesterday. After four consecutive trading days, the Shanghai Composite Index continued to courageously advance to the earlier high point. The highest intraday price reached 2931 points, basically reaching the earlier high point. The Shenzhen Composite Index showed a stronger trend. At the close, it had exceeded the recent high point and reached a new closing high since November 12 last year. The trading volume of the two cities continued to increase moderately. The price rise and volume increase indicates that incremental funds are gradually entering the market, which is conducive to the continued improvement of the stock index in the future. In the afternoon trading yesterday, the stock index showed a sharp fluctuation. The Shanghai Composite Index continued to dive when it attacked the previous high point, but it regained support and rose when it fell back to the 2900 point integer pass. We believe that the stock index has been continuously fluctuating near 2920 points for 6 trading days, accumulating a certain pressure of trapped disks. It is reasonable for the stock index to fluctuate and consolidate at this position. The slight panic diving is conducive to cleaning up the short-term unstable profit making chips, which is conducive to the stock index to continue to attack upwards in the future. At the same time, this also reflects that the current main funds are intended for the long term. ● Donghai Securities is about to challenge the previous high point. The PMI of the economic leading indicator announced yesterday was 52.2%, a decrease of 0.7 percentage points from the previous month. It was also the third consecutive month of decline, showing that the year-on-year economic growth rate declined. However, we believe that the economic fundamentals will improve relatively in March. First, the rebound of new loans in January shows that enterprises have strong potential investment demand. We believe that corporate investment demand will become apparent with the rebound of money supply growth. Secondly, real estate investment is facing improvement. The largest security affordable housing project in our history has been fully launched, which will make up for the gap of commercial housing investment decline. From the real estate stocks such as Poly Real Estate that announced their performance yesterday, the dynamic price earnings ratio will quickly drop to less than 10 times, and the rebound of real estate stocks is becoming increasingly strong. Again, the overseas economy continues to recover. The recent leading indicators of the European and American economies show that the recovery of the overseas economy is continuing. Although the tense situation in the Middle East has led to a substantial rise in oil prices, it will not have a significant negative impact on the recovery of the world economy at present, and the situation in the Middle East has a tendency to become clear. Unexpectedly, the recent tense international situation will ease, and the surrounding markets have begun to continue to recover. These will stimulate A-shares to rebound with it. It is expected that the market will continue to rise in the coming trading days and choose the opportunity to break through the pressure of 2939 points and 2944 points in the earlier period. ● Beijing Stock Exchange rose and震动 more opportunities. Yesterday, the market fluctuated and rose. In the afternoon, after the bank sector rushed to a new high, it showed a rapid dive. At the end of the day, under the promotion of the two oils, the stock index recovered some of its lost ground. From the perspective of the market, the main game was quite obvious. Several recent rapid declines were accompanied by instantaneous expansion of trading volume, and then funds rose to take over the game, promoting the stock index to continue to improve. However, the main power for the upward pick at the end of yesterday came from the weighted stocks. Combined with the net outflow of some funds in the morning trading, it shows that some stocks with large increases are making profits. Therefore, although the medium-term trend of the post market is still optimistic, the trend of sector differentiation will be strengthened in the short term. We believe that as long as there are opportunities to make money in the market, they should not be an obstacle to operation. Moreover, the medium-term market is optimistic, and the probability of major systematic risks is small. Aggressive investors can look for opportunities in the sectors of new materials, cement, agriculture and so on, and stable investors can continue to control their positions and wait for the market hot spots to appear clearly."
你的房子能值多少钱？佐藤先生家住东京都中野区，已经安家长崎的儿子也无意返回东京。佐藤先生已经72岁，身体每况愈下。近日他奔走于各大银行之间，咨询倒按揭的事。自己的年龄、房地产权归属等条件都符合条件，现在，最关键的是土地和房屋的价值评估问题。40年前以1亿日元买下的这块土地加房屋，怎么也能评估到8000多万日元吧，他想。可是估价结果是4200万日元，佐藤先生不信，连跑4家银行，结果估价额都差不多。房屋和土地的估价是倒按揭中最重要的一环，因为关系到按揭人的可融资额度。在日本，虽然每家银行各自有指定的估价机构，但是主要的估价指标都是相同的，主要包括：土地价、房屋的折旧率、房屋的现价和将来预期价等等。日本多数银行不接受公寓抵押根据2003年数据，在日本，地价同房屋的市值比值是6.9：1。在倒按揭的估价中，地价的占比更高，多数说法是对房屋的估价接近0，这也是多数银行不接受用公寓抵押来做倒按揭的主要原因，虽然银行没有在明文中规定不接受公寓的倒按揭，但在实际的操作中，一般公寓是会被拒绝的。在历史中，极少数被接受倒按揭的高档公寓的评估价值也是非常低，同购买价是不可比的。其实，日本的公寓产权中是含有小面积土地的，只是因为面积太小，在倒按揭的估价中的价值占比还是太小，起不到保值的作用。可贷款的额度还要再打折扣，一般是估价额的70%左右。因此，金融机构一般只挑估价额在5000万日元有的甚至要求是1亿日元以上的不动产才做的。对于倒按揭的申请人，过去银行的规定是限于55岁以上，但是随着日本的人均寿命的延长，现在多数银行把年龄界限设置在60岁以上，甚至还有的产品要求申请人是在65、75岁以上。房屋产权的归属要求是贷款人本人或者夫妇是唯一产权所有者，在签订倒按揭合同的同时，申请人会被要求签署遗嘱，明确产权将在贷款期满之后归属于放贷机构。在中国推广倒按揭的难点在中国，倒按揭的推广还有许多课题需要研究。同日本的房产相比较，中国的房产有很多不同之处，比如中国的房屋不包含土地、使用权是有年限的、房屋的平均使用寿命较短、房价一直处于快速涨价通道等。中国房屋的平均寿命是多长呢？有数据称，新建筑的平均使用寿命尚不足30年。可见，在给这样的房屋估价时，不确定的变量太多，房屋的估价存在难度，因此需要建立科学的估价模型，它要能在最大限度上平衡贷款方和放贷方的双方的利益和风险。此外，估价标准、估价的执行机构的选择、对于抵押物的约束条件(诸如建筑年限、保养程度等)、贷款利息的约定(在日本一般采用浮动利率)、贷款人的贷款期限预测等等操作层面的技术性问题，也是在推行倒按揭的过程中需要解决好的一些问题。政府应扮演什么角色？那么，倒按揭的操作方应该是谁呢？银行、保险公司加上政府。银行和保险公司是执行者不错，但是从日本和美国的实际操作历史来看，政府必须扮演推动者的角色。在日本，倒按揭的放贷方主体分成政府机构和民间机构两种。地方政府提供的倒按揭服务包括：地方政府直接提供融资、地方政府协调通过民间金融机构融资、通过地方社会福利协会融资、通过地方住宅公积金融资四种主要的方式。在日本，政府主要为不动产的估价在5000万日元以下的贷款者融资，来帮助金融机构不愿做的中低端客户。日本公寓约占总住宅数的10%，预计有0.8兆亿日元的市场，还有待于开发。因为属于中低端的市场，估计还是需要政府来主导推动公寓倒按揭市场的开发。在美国，联邦住宅局(FHA)的保险机关为倒按揭提供保险服务，在直接关系到贷款人利益的“不动产估价”这一关键点上，FHA对评估机构直接实行指导和教育的权力。这对于贷款人是极大的保障，也能有效减少后期纠纷，并促进倒按揭的推广。倒按揭在日本的推广虽然艰难而漫长，但是它利国利民的作用已经被社会认可。据推算如果有20000名高龄者使用倒按揭，可以为日本减少政府支出100亿日元。祝愿倒按揭也能早日惠及中国的老年朋友们。(作者为日本养老产业专家、皇家庄园管理公司执行董事)我要评论	佐藤	正向	"How much is your house worth? Mr. Sato lives in Nakano District, Tokyo. His son who has settled in Nagasaki has no intention of returning to Tokyo. Mr. Sato is 72 years old and his health is declining. Recently, he ran around major banks to consult on mortgage matters. His age, real estate rights and other conditions are in line with the requirements. Now, the most important thing is the valuation of land and houses. I think this land and house, which was bought for 100 million yen 40 years ago, can also be evaluated at more than 80 million yen. However, the valuation result was 42 million yen. Mr. Sato didn't believe it. He ran four banks, and the valuation amount was almost the same. The valuation of houses and land is the most important part of the reverse mortgage, because it is related to the financing amount of the mortgagee. In Japan, although each bank has its own designated appraisal agency, the main appraisal indicators are the same, mainly including: land price, depreciation rate of the house, present price and future expected price of the house, etc. According to the 2003 data, in Japan, the ratio of land price to the market value of houses is 6.9:1. In the valuation of reverse mortgage, the proportion of land prices is higher. The valuation of houses is close to 0. This is also the main reason why most banks do not accept apartments as mortgage for reverse mortgage. Although banks have not specified in the text that apartments are not acceptable for reverse mortgage, in actual operation, general apartments will be rejected. In history, the evaluation value of the very few high-grade apartments accepted for reverse mortgage is also very low, which is incomparable with the purchase price. In fact, the property rights of apartments in Japan contain small area land. However, because the area is too small, the proportion of land value in the valuation of reverse mortgage is still too small to serve as a means of preserving the value. The loan amount that can be discounted is generally around 70% of the valuation amount. Therefore, financial institutions generally only choose real estate with an estimated value of 50 million yen or even more than 100 million yen. For the applicants of reverse mortgage, the past bank regulations were limited to those over 55 years old, but with the extension of the average life expectancy of Japanese people, now most banks set the age limit at more than 60 years old, and even some products require the applicants to be more than 65 or 75 years old. The requirement of the right of house property is that the borrower himself or his spouse is the only property right owner. When signing the reverse mortgage contract, the applicant will be required to sign a will, which clearly stipulates that the property right will belong to the lending institution after the loan period expires. Difficulties in promoting reverse mortgage in China There are still many problems to be studied in the promotion of reverse mortgage in China. Compared with Japanese real estate, Chinese real estate has many differences, such as houses do not include land, usage rights are limited, the average service life of houses is short, and house prices have been in a rapid price rising channel. How long is the average life span of houses in China? According to the data, the average service life of new buildings is less than 30 years. It can be seen that there are too many uncertain variables in the valuation of such houses, and the valuation of houses is difficult, so a scientific valuation model needs to be established, which can balance the interests and risks of both the loaner and the lender to the greatest extent. In addition, some technical problems at the operational level, such as the selection of valuation standards, valuation execution agencies, constraints on mortgaged goods (such as building age, maintenance level), loan interest rate agreements (floating interest rates are generally used in Japan), loan term forecast of borrowers, and so on, also need to be solved in the process of promoting reverse mortgage. What role should the government play? Then, who should be the operator of reverse mortgage? Banks, insurance companies and the government. Banks and insurance companies are good executors, but from the perspective of the actual operation history in Japan and the United States, the government must play the role of promoter. In Japan, the lending body of reverse mortgage is divided into government agencies and civilian agencies. The reverse mortgage services provided by the local government include: the local government directly provides financing, the local government coordinates financing through civilian financial institutions, financing through local social welfare associations, and four main ways of financing through local housing provident funds. In Japan, the government mainly provides financing for loans with a real estate valuation of less than 50 million yen, in order to help medium and low end customers who are unwilling to do so by financial institutions. Japanese apartments account for about 10% of the total number of houses. It is estimated that there is a market of 0.8 billion yen waiting to be developed. Because it belongs to the middle and low end market, it is estimated that the government will still need to lead the development of the apartment mortgage market. In the United States, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides insurance services for reverse mortgage. With respect to the key point of ""real estate valuation"" which is directly related to the interests of the loaner, the FHA has the right to directly implement guidance and education to the evaluation organization. This is a great guarantee for the loaner, and it can also effectively reduce the later disputes and promote the promotion of reverse mortgage. The promotion of reverse mortgage in Japan is difficult and long, but its role in benefiting the country and the people has been recognized by the society. It is estimated that if 20000 elderly people use reverse mortgage, it can reduce the government's expenditure in Japan by 1 billion yen. I wish reverse mortgage can also benefit the elderly friends in China as soon as possible.

穆迪：亚太地区主权信用评级稳定向好摘要：穆迪发布报告称，亚太地区21个主权信用评级总体仍保持稳定乃至积极走向。中国和其他新兴市场国家在2010年上半年引领了全球经济复苏。汇通网1月31日讯——穆迪投资者服务公司(Moody'sInvestorsService)周一(31日)召开新闻发布会，发布了《亚太地区主权评级年中展望》报告，称亚太地区21个主权信用评级总体仍保持稳定乃至积极走向。穆迪亚洲和中东地区主权信用风险业务分析师拜恩(ThomasByrne)表示，亚太地区主权信用评级并没有因此次全球金融危机而遭降，未来12个月，该地区多数主权信用基本面仍可能保持稳固。2010年年初以来，穆迪上调了韩国主权信用评级以及印度本币信用评级，将印尼评级前景从稳定调制积极，泰国和越南评级前景依旧为负面。拜恩指出：“中国经济强劲增长帮助铸就了区域经济的V型复苏，中国大陆对地区出口的强劲需求成为关键推动力。该地区多数国家经济产出已经完全恢复至危机前水平，中国和其他新兴市场国家在2010年上半年引领了全球经济复苏。”他还表示：“从总体上看，亚太地区经济以及评级前景面临的风险可控，我们相信，即便全球金融市场进一步发生动荡，该地区21个主权信用评级也会展示出强大的适应性。”穆迪维持日本Aa2评级的稳定前景不变，但同时表示该国容易遭受全球经济增长或者出口需求放缓的打击。此外，一旦巩固预算以及恢复经济增长的政策失效，日本评级前景就会面临下行压力。穆迪还表示，若中国以及发达经济体经济增速放缓，亚太地区增长速度也将随之下降，发达经济体经济增长面临的不确定性也可能影响该地区未来几年的增长强度。	ThomasByrne,拜恩	正向	"Moody's: The abstract of the stable and good sovereign credit rating in the Asia Pacific region shows that Moody's reports that the overall sovereign credit rating in the Asia Pacific region is still stable and even positive. China and other emerging market countries led the global economic recovery in the first half of 2010. Huitong com, January 31- On Monday (31), Moody's Investors Service held a press conference to release the ""Asia Pacific Sovereign Rating Mid Year Outlook"" report, saying that the overall sovereign credit rating in the Asia Pacific region is still stable and even positive. Thomas Byrne, an analyst of sovereign credit risk business in Asia and the Middle East of Moody's, said that the sovereign credit rating in the Asia Pacific region had not been downgraded due to the global financial crisis, and in the next 12 months, the sovereign credit fundamentals of most countries in the region were still likely to remain stable. Since the beginning of 2010, Moody's has raised South Korea's sovereign credit rating and India's local currency credit rating, adjusted Indonesia's rating prospects from stable to positive, and Thailand and Vietnam's rating prospects are still negative. Byrne pointed out: ""China's strong economic growth helped to create a V-shaped recovery of the regional economy, and the strong demand of the Chinese mainland for regional exports was the key driving force. Economic output of most countries in the region has fully recovered to the pre crisis level, and China and other emerging market countries led the global economic recovery in the first half of 2010."" He also said: ""On the whole, the risks faced by the Asia Pacific economy and the rating prospects are controllable, and we believe that even if the global financial market further Turbulence, the 21 sovereign credit ratings in the region will also show strong adaptability."" Moody's maintains the stable prospects of Japan's Aa2 rating unchanged, but at the same time, it indicates that the country is vulnerable to the impact of the slowdown in global economic growth or export demand. In addition, once the policy of consolidating the budget and restoring economic growth fails, the rating prospects of Japan will face downward pressure. Moody's also said that if China and developed economies slow down their economic growth, the growth rate of the Asia Pacific region will also decline, and the uncertainty of economic growth in developed economies may also affect the growth intensity of the region in the coming years."
苹果再诉宏达电侵犯其两项专利权连环诉讼再现比特网(ChinaByte)6月24日消息，据国外媒体报道，苹果本周再向美国特拉华州地区法院提起诉讼，称宏达电(HTC)侵犯了该公司的另两项专利。根据法庭文件，苹果在本次诉讼中提到了四项专利。但是其中两项已经包含于此前的诉讼中。苹果在本次诉讼中新增的两项专利为：-6282646：随显示配置改变而实时调整的系统和-7380116：随显示配置改变而实时调整的系统。今年3月初，苹果对宏达电提起诉讼，称宏达电侵犯了苹果与iPhone图形界面、架构及硬件相关的20项专利。美国国际贸易委员会目前仍在调查苹果对宏达电的侵权申诉。在上次诉讼尚无定论的情况下，苹果再次发难，显然是继续施压。目前，两家公司都向美国国际贸易委员会起诉对方，要求禁止进口另一家公司的产品。业内人士分析，许多关注国外市场的中国公司都知道，在国外的竞争中，诉讼尤其是专利诉讼是相当常见的。苹果公司对台湾HTC公司提起的专利诉讼是一个大型科技公司试图防止一个新崛起的竞争对手分割现有市场的实例。HTC是一家智能手机制造商，2009年该公司率先在其生产的手机上运行谷歌Android操作系统。不久后，HTC又开始制造谷歌广泛推广的Nexus智能手机。2010年初，HTC推出了一款新智能手机(Legend)，其设计看起来很像最初的iPhone。因此，在智能手机制造商中，HTC被看做是苹果最有威胁性的竞争对手之一。据悉，截至2010年6月9日，HTC只有100多个专利(不包括正在购买和争取许可的)。这个数字大大低于其他主要手机制造公司。而同一数据库显示苹果有3000多项专利，更不要提其数量庞大的专利申请了。所以，苹果的战略手段是通过打击竞争对手中最薄弱的环节来阻止或至少减慢对手侵占自己市场的速度。		正向	Apple sued HTC again for infringing its two patents, and the serial lawsuit reappeared in Bitnet (ChinaByte) on June 24. According to foreign media reports, Apple filed another lawsuit with the District Court of Delaware, USA this week, saying that HTC infringed on another two patents of the company. According to court documents, Apple mentioned four patents in this lawsuit. However, two of them have been included in the previous lawsuit. The two new patents added by Apple in this lawsuit are: -6282646: a system that changes and adjusts with the display configuration and-7380116: a system that changes and adjusts with the display configuration. In early March this year, Apple sued HTC, saying that HTC infringed 20 patents of Apple, which were related to iPhone's graphics interface, architecture and hardware. The United States International Trade Commission is still investigating Apple's complaint of infringement against HTC. In the absence of a conclusion in the last lawsuit, Apple again made a difficult move, obviously to continue to exert pressure. At present, both companies have sued each other with the US International Trade Commission, demanding a ban on the import of products from another company. Industry insiders analyze that many Chinese companies that pay attention to the foreign market know that litigation, especially patent litigation, is quite common in foreign competitions. Apple's patent litigation against HTC in Taiwan is an example of a large technology company trying to prevent a new competitor from dividing the existing market. HTC is a smart phone manufacturer. In 2009, it was the first company to run Google's Android operating system on its mobile phones. Soon after, HTC began to manufacture the Nexus smartphone widely promoted by Google. In early 2010, HTC launched a new smartphone (Legend), which looks very similar to the original iPhone in design. As a result, HTC is regarded as one of Apple's most threatening competitors among smartphone manufacturers. It is reported that as of June 9, 2010, HTC has only more than 100 patents (excluding those being purchased and licensed). This figure is far lower than other major mobile phone manufacturing companies. The same database shows that Apple has more than 3000 patents, let alone its huge number of patent applications. So, Apple's strategic means is to prevent or at least slow down the opponent's occupation of its own market by striking the weakest link of the competitor.
女大学生跨省为病友筹款微博悼念称来生再见《湖南女大学生赴粤为先心病友筹款》续“三军哥，来生再见”信息时报讯(记者何剑辉)信息时报曾在本月20日报道湖南女大学生胡双赴粤为先心病友筹款一事。前日晚上8时许，患有先天性心脏病的23岁小伙崔三军在广东省人民医院抢救无效病逝。胡双昨日再一次来到广州，给崔三军送行，并在微博留言“三军哥，来生再见”。闻三军去世双妹急赴穗昨日上午6时58分，人在湖南的胡双哭着给记者打来电话：“崔大叔说，三军哥昨天晚上去世了。我不敢相信，前几天他才转出ICU病房的。”上午10时，胡双的姐姐给记者来电说，“胡双已经登上了前往广州的高铁，她身体不好，麻烦您接一下她”。下午1时许，胡双到达广州，因本身也患有先心病的原因，哭得双眼通红的她更显得十分虚弱。在乘坐地铁前往广东省人民医院的途中，她不断地对记者说，“前几天我离开广州时，医生说三军哥起码能坚持一个月。上海一位明星一直关注三军哥的病情，还说过段时间就能请到最好的医生让三军哥去上海治疗……他怎么会走得这么突然……”三军未签协议无法捐遗体下午2时30分，到省人民医院后，胡双直奔到崔三军生前住的病房，护士安慰她说，“昨晚被送到4楼的ICU病房抢救，小伙曾已经去世了。别哭，赶紧去问问看能否和他再见一面”。胡双随后碰到了正处理崔三军后事的崔三军父亲。崔大叔看到胡双哭红了的双眼，也不禁哭了起来，“埋怨”胡双说，“你过来干什么，这不又浪费钱吗”。胡双说，“大叔，这个时候还谈什么钱，我还能见三军哥一面吗？”但当崔三军父亲办理完手续后，带着胡双进入了医院的车库，运载崔三军遗体的车已开走前往殡仪馆了。胡双告诉记者，她特意从长沙赶来广州，一个目的就是希望能帮崔三军实现捐献遗体的愿望。胡双说，“在广州深圳住院期间，三军哥也曾多次对我说要捐献遗体的事。他是希望能对社会做出贡献，并且希望有人能关心他60多岁的老父亲和智障的哥哥。”可惜，因为崔三军生前并没有真正签订捐献遗体的协议，其遗体只能火化处理。胡双说，“医生说，三军哥没有签订协议。另外时间过得太长了，遗体捐献是要在死亡后两小时内进行各项保护工作。三军哥的遗体只能火化，他唯一的遗愿无法实现了。”双妹奔波劳累入院吸氧昨日下午6时许，忙碌12小时后，疲惫的胡双陪同崔三军父亲回到住宿的地方。胡双说，“我感觉自己有点喘不过起来。”为防万一，胡双在安顿好崔三军父亲后，自己前往医院做检查。由于下午有些劳累，医生要求她吸氧恢复一下。今日，胡双将陪同崔大叔到殡仪馆为三军送行。在确认崔三军逝世后，胡双抽空在新浪微博“先心病崔三军的呼唤”上，写下这样一句话，“天堂不会有贫穷，不会有病魔……那里又多了一个顽强小子，三军哥，今生只能做你小妹了，‘来生再见’”。事件回顾两名病友的真情故事崔三军，是河南舞阳人，7岁时被查出患有先心病，由于家境贫寒，中专休学来广东打工，去年春病情逐渐严重，家人与他开始四处求医。去年8月，崔三军注册名为“极度号唤”的新浪微博求援，记录治病经历，并曾表示“愿捐献身体帮助他人”。胡双是湖南中医药大学学生，也是一名先心病患者，与崔三军在网上求医过程中认识后，积极帮助崔三军筹款治疗，并注册了“先心病崔三军的呼唤”的新浪微博进行筹款。胡双的善行得到了不少网友的支持和捐款。	何剑辉,崔大叔,胡双,崔三军,三军哥	正向	"Microblog mourns for the sick friend, a female college student from Hunan, to raise money in Guangdong for the sick friend, and continues ""Goodbye in the next life, Brother Sanjun"". Information Times (He Jianhui) reported on the 20th of this month that Hu Shuang, a female college student from Hunan, went to Guangdong to raise money for the sick friend. At about 8:00 pm on the evening of the day before yesterday, Cui Sanjun, a 23 year old young man with congenital heart disease, died in the People's Hospital of Guangdong Province after ineffective rescue. Hu Shuang came to Guangzhou again yesterday to see Cui Sanjun off, and left a message in microblog ""Sanjun Ge, see you again in the next life"". At 6:58 a.m. yesterday, Hu Shuang, who was in Hunan, cried to the reporter on the phone: ""Uncle Cui said that Sanjun Ge died last night. I can't believe that he has just left the ICU ward for a few days."" At 10:00 a.m., Hu Shuang's sister called the reporter to say, ""Hu Shuang has got on the high-speed rail to Guangzhou, she is in poor health, and it's troublesome for you to pick her up"". At about 1:00 p.m., Hu Shuang arrived in Guangzhou, and because she also suffered from congenital heart disease, her eyes were red from crying, which made her look very weak. On the way to the People's Hospital of Guangdong Province by subway, she kept saying to the reporter, ""When I left Guangzhou a few days ago, the doctor said that Brother Sanjun could last at least a month. A star in Shanghai has been paying attention to Sanjun Ge's condition, and it will be possible to invite the best doctors to let Sanjun Ge go to Shanghai for treatment in a few days... Why did he leave so suddenly..."" Sanjun did not sign an agreement and could not donate his body At 2:30 p.m., after arriving at the Provincial People's Hospital, Hu Shuang went straight to the ward where Cui Sanjun lived. The nurse comforted her, ""The young man has died after being sent to the ICU ward on the fourth floor last night. Don't cry, hurry up and ask if you can see him again"". Hu Shuang then met Cui Sanjun's father, who was dealing with Cui Sanjun's funeral. When Uncle Cui saw Hu Shuang's red eyes, he couldn't help crying either, ""complaining"" to Hu Shuang, ""What are you doing here, it's not going to waste money again"". Hu Shuang said, ""Uncle, what's the matter with money at this time, can I see Brother Sanjun again?"" But when Cui Sanjun's father finished the procedure and took Hu Shuang to the garage of the hospital, the car carrying Cui Sanjun's body had left for the funeral home. Hu Shuang told the reporter that she特意came to Guangzhou from Changsha in order to help Cui Sanjun realize his wish to donate his body. Hu Shuang said, ""While staying in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Sanjun Ge also told me several times that he wanted to donate his body. He hoped to make contributions to the society and hoped that someone could care about his 60 year old father and his brother with intellectual disability."" Unfortunately, because Cui Sanjun did not really sign an agreement to donate his body during his lifetime, his body could only be cremated. Hu Shuang said, ""The doctor said that Sanjun Ge had not signed an agreement. Besides, the time was too long. The donation of the body should be carried out within two hours after death. Sanjun Ge's body can only be cremated, and his only wish can not be realized."" At 6:00 p.m. yesterday, after working for 12 hours, the tired Hu Shuang accompanied Cui Sanjun's father back to his place of accommodation. Hu Shuang said, ""I feel a little short of breath."" In case of any accident, Hu Shuang went to the hospital for a check-up after settling Cui Sanjun's father. Because of some fatigue in the afternoon, the doctor asked her to oxygen to recover. Today, Hu Shuang will accompany Uncle Cui to the funeral home to see Sanjun off. After confirming Cui Sanjun's death, Hu Shuang took the time to write on Sina Microblog ""Cui Sanjun's call for congenital heart disease"", ""There will be no poverty in heaven, no demons... There is another tough little boy there. Sanjun Ge, I can only be your little sister in this life, 'see you in the next life'"". Review of events The true story of two sick friends, Cui Sanjun, is from Wuyang, Henan. He was found to suffer from congenital heart disease at the age of 7. Because of his poor family, he took a job in Guangdong after taking a leave of absence from a secondary school. Last spring, his condition gradually worsened, and his family and he began to seek medical treatment everywhere. In August last year, Cui Sanjun registered a microblog named ""Extreme Calling"" to call for help, record his medical experience, and once said ""I would like to donate my body to help others"". Hu Shuang is a student of Hunan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and also a patient of congenital heart disease. After getting to know Cui Sanjun in the process of online medical treatment, he actively helped Cui Sanjun to raise money for treatment, and registered the microblog ""Cui Sanjun's Call for Congenital Heart Disease"" to raise money. Hu Shuang's kindness has won the support and donation of many netizens."

基金：中央汇金入市意义更重大证券时报记者杨磊程满清股市热切期盼的利好政策终于出台，证券交易印花税单边收取和中央汇金公司将购买工中建三大行股票的利好政策同时出台。基金经理们普遍认为，利好政策的及时出台有利于稳定股市投资者的信心，其中，汇金公司入市意义要比单边收取印花税更重要。银行股上涨对股指形成支撑基金经理普遍认为，中央汇金公司出人意料地直接购买三大银行股，此举意义重大，将对股市形成明显的支撑作用。因为银行股在中国股市的权重最大，占到了沪深300指数两成以上的份额，银行股的上涨预期将对股指形成很大的支撑。“单边收取印花税的作用主要体现在心理层面上，毕竟在现阶段的成交水平上，单边收取印花税一年只能节约资金100亿元左右，对资金面直接影响不大。如果投资者对未来股市信心不足，单降低印花税影响有限。”北京一位基金经理表示。回顾今年4月份印花税从千分之三下调到千分之一后股市的表现，一些基金经理对此次印花税单边收取的作用仍然有所担心。有基金经理认为，宏观经济形势和大小非问题依然是影响股市最大的问题，降低印花税的政策只能缓解市场恐慌情绪，如果国际和国内的经济形势进一步下滑，单边印花税的救市效果可能微乎其微。购买三大行股票是共赢深圳一位基金经理表示，汇金公司作为三大行的股东，直接购买三大行的股票本身就可以缓解市场对银行股大小非减持的担忧。而在购买价格上，建行远低于A股IPO价格，中行昨日收盘仍略低于3.08元的IPO价格，只有工行略高于IPO价格，汇金公司以发行价左右甚至低于发行价购买三大行股票，对市场各方来说都是一个共赢的局面。记者采访中了解到，多只基金在沪指跌破2000点大关之后就在逐步加仓。其中一位基金经理表示，2000点以下加仓的投资行为主要是从估值的角度来考虑的，并没有刻意去“赌”利好政策。单边印花税和汇金购买三大行的组合利好出台后，基金将根据市场情况波段操作，从目前情况来看，沪指1800点的阶段底部也已经初步探明。	程满清,杨磊程	正向	"Fund: China Securities Times reporter Yang Lei Cheng Manqing's long-awaited good policy has finally come out. The good policies of stamp duty on securities transactions and China Cinda's purchase of the three major banks' shares have come out at the same time. Fund managers generally believe that the timely introduction of favorable policies is helpful to stabilize the confidence of stock market investors. Among them, Cinda's entry into the market is more important than the unilateral collection of stamp duties. Fund managers generally believe that the unexpected direct purchase of the three major bank stocks by China Cinda is significant and will have an obvious supporting effect on the stock market. Because bank stocks have the largest weight in China's stock market, accounting for more than 20% of the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 Index, the expectation of bank stocks' rise will have a great support for the stock index. ""The effect of collecting stamp duty on a single side is mainly reflected at the psychological level. After all, at the current trading level, the annual savings of collecting stamp duty on a single side is only about 100 billion yuan, which has little direct impact on the capital side. If investors lack confidence in the future stock market, the effect of reducing stamp duty alone is limited."" said a fund manager in Beijing. Looking back at the performance of the stock market after the stamp duty was cut from 3% to 1% in April this year, some fund managers are still worried about the effect of the unilateral collection of stamp duty this time. Some fund managers believe that the macroeconomic situation and the non tradable shares of large and small size are still the biggest problems affecting the stock market. The policy of reducing stamp duty can only alleviate market panic. If the international and domestic economic situation further declines, the effect of saving the market by stamp duty on a single side may be negligible. It is a win-win situation for all parties in the market to purchase shares of the three major banks. A fund manager in Shenzhen said that as a shareholder of the three major banks, Cinda can alleviate the market's concern about the reduction of non tradable shares of large and small banks by directly purchasing the shares of the three major banks. In terms of purchase price, CCB is far lower than the A-share IPO price. The closing price of Bank of China yesterday is still slightly lower than the IPO price of 3.08 yuan, and only ICBC is slightly higher than the IPO price. Cinda's purchase of the three major bank stocks at the issuance price or even lower than the issuance price is a win-win situation for all parties in the market. In the course of the interview, the reporter learned that many funds have been gradually increasing their positions after the Shanghai Stock Index broke through the 2000 point mark. One of the fund managers said that the investment behavior of adding positions below 2000 points is mainly considered from the perspective of valuation, and there is no deliberate ""gambling"" on the favorable policy. After the combined benefit of single stamp duty and Cinda's purchase of the three major banks came out, the fund will operate in phases according to the market situation. From the current situation, the phased bottom of 1800 points of the Shanghai Stock Index has also been preliminarily explored."

Talbots第一财季亏损缩小新浪财经讯北京时间周二晚间消息，服装零售商TalbotsInc(TLB)宣布，第一财季亏损缩小，主要得益于其春季服装的强劲销售。调整后盈利好于预期，该公司因此预计全年调整后盈利将超过市场预期。经历了衰退期间的销售疲软之后，Talbots今年早些时候达成了一项复杂交易，使其得以削减债务，并买断了最大股东——日本零售商Aeon(U.S.A。)Inc的股份。截至5月1日的财季，该公司净亏损从上年同期的2360万美元，合每股44美分，降至440万美元，合每股8美分。扣除重组开支，以及与Aeon交易相关的开支后，该公司当季每股盈利38美分。接受汤森路透调查的分析师平均预期该公司当季每股盈利16美分，分析师预期中一般不包括一次性项目。季度营收增长4%，从上年同期的3.06亿美元增至3.21亿美元，低于分析师平均预期的3.23亿美元。同店销售额、即开业至少一年的店面的销售额增长了2.4%，主要得益于全价销售项目的增加。对于第二财季，Talbots预计调整后每股盈利0-5美分，营收将呈低单位数增长。分析师平均预期该公司第二季每股盈利5美分。Talbots预计全年调整后盈利75-83美分，营收将增长3-5%。分析师平均预期该公司全年每股盈利73美分。		正向	Sina Finance reported on Tuesday evening, Beijing time. Talbots Inc (TLB), a clothing retailer, announced that its loss in the first quarter narrowed, mainly due to the strong sales of its spring clothing. Adjusted earnings were better than expected, and the company expects full-year adjusted earnings to exceed market expectations. After experiencing weak sales during the recession, Talbots reached a complex deal earlier this year, allowing it to cut debt and buy out the shares of its largest shareholder, Japanese retailer Aeon (U.S.A.) Inc. For the quarter ended May 1, the company's net loss fell to $4.4 million, or 8 cents a share, from $23.6 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring expenses and expenses related to the Aeon transaction, the company's earnings per share for the quarter were 38 cents. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect the company to earn 16 cents a share for the quarter, and analysts' expectations generally do not include one-time items. Quarterly revenue grew 4% from $306 million in the same period last year to $321 million, lower than the average expectation of $323 million of analysts. Same store sales, that is, sales of stores that have been open for at least one year, increased by 2.4%, mainly due to the increase of full price sales items. For the second quarter, Talbots expects adjusted earnings per share of 0-5 cents and revenue will grow by low single digits. Analysts expect the company to earn 5 cents per share in the second quarter. Talbots expects full-year adjusted earnings of 75-83 cents per share and revenue will grow by 3%-5%. Analysts expect the company to earn 73 cents per share for the full year.
大和首予内地汽车股中性评级新浪财经讯2月25日消息，大和指出，国内乘用车销量在经历2009年同比增长53%?2010年增长33%之后，2011年的增长率将大幅放缓至12%；首予内地汽车股中性评级。大和补充说，2010年的销量在一定程度上得益于政府推出的一次性激励措施和减税政策，而这些措施和政策在2011年都不再继续执行。该行表示，在销量增长率降低的环境中，二三线城市的销量情况将突出。该行称，由于这些城市居民的收入水平较一线城市低，因而像长城汽车(2333.HK)?吉利汽车(0175.HK)和比亚迪(1211.HK)等国产品牌将受益最大。欢迎发表评论我要评论		正向	Dahua first gave the mainland auto industry a neutral rating. Sina Finance News reported on February 25 that the domestic passenger car sales growth rate will slow down significantly to 12% in 2011 after a year-on-year growth of 53% in 2009 and 33% in 2010? First, give the mainland auto industry a neutral rating. Dahua added that the 2010 sales were partly due to the one-time incentives and tax reduction policies launched by the government, which were not continued in 2011. The bank said that the sales in second and third tier cities will stand out in the environment of declining sales growth rate. The bank said that domestic brands such as Great Wall Motor (2333. HK)?

盛大觊觎四年之后终得华友：整合可能艰难孙冰/北京报道喧嚣多日、剧情在盛大与独立财团之间峰回路f转了几次之后，华友终于如愿地收到了来自盛大的丰厚offer(要约函)。收购对于近几年来一直到处“扫货”的盛大来说不是新闻，而被收购对于连年亏损、待卖许久的华友而言更不是新闻，但是“网游老大”出手收购一家SP和音乐公司，还是会引发业界和大众无数的遐想。觊觎四年6月8日晚，盛大互动娱乐有限公司(下称“盛大”)和华友控股有限公司(下称“华友”)联合发布公告：双方已签署正式协议，同意由盛大的一家全资子公司启动要约收购，以收购华友已发行普通股总数的51%，总收购价约为4620万美元。此收购价与华友前一个交易日(即6月5日)股价相比提供了25%的溢价。51%的收购比例与事先传闻的80%有一定差距，但4620万美元的出价，高于另外一个买家——由欢乐传媒总裁董朝晖牵头组成的独立财团(下称“独立财团”)所开出的4000万美元的出价。此前，该独立财团一直是华友收购传闻的主角，但是华友董事会否决了其收购要约，同时市场传出盛大作为第三方入局，并获华友管理层力邀的消息。“收购华友符合盛大一贯的互动娱乐媒体战略，”盛大公关总监、新闻发言人诸葛辉在接受《中国经济周刊》采访时表示，“盛大一贯的目标是做互动娱乐，我们一直在向这个战略方向努力，收购华友是符合这个战略的，我们也一直都在评估关注类似战略的机会。”但是对于盛大将如何对华友进行整合等信息，诸葛辉表示目前不便透露。“我们尊重华友董事会和管理层过去所做的努力以及为华友未来制定的战略和方向，我相信在盛大的用户、资源和平台的支持下，华友将获得更大的发展。”他说，“但是我们目前只是提出一个意向，还没有正式启动具体的要约收购。这是一个系列程序，我们现在做的是第一步，只是双方签署了这样一个协议。”据记者了解，即使毫无变数，要约收购完成也至少需要20个交易日左右。记者试图联系华友方面，但是相关负责人的电话一直无人接听。华友董事长王秦岱也尚未在媒体面前露面，只是在发给媒体的官方声明中表示：“我们相信华友和盛大拥有共同的愿景成为数码娱乐业的领头人。两家公司在内容、分发平台和用户群方面的互补将为双方的未来发展提供巨大的协同效应。”“对于华友来说，盛大当然是一个更好的选择。”艾瑞咨询分析师赵旭枫告诉《中国经济周刊》，“独立财团能给华友的只是一些资金上的援助，盛大则还能给华友一些资源和帮助，更不用说盛大的出价更高了。”她说。据盛大一位内部人士向《中国经济周刊》透露，其实早在2005年，盛大就与华友进行过收购谈判，而且几乎谈成。但是当时盛大正在忙着收购新浪，手中现金有限，加上有高层有不同意见，所以最终未能成行。“当时华友的股价是现在的三倍左右，现在买便宜了很多。”该人士说。只是一个便宜的壳？盛大为何如此钟情华友，甚至心仪了几年？尽管一直以“网络迪斯尼”为目标并自称为“互动娱乐公司”，但是大众还是会将盛大归入网游公司之列，而且其大部分营收也确实来自于游戏业务。根据盛大2009年第一季度财报显示，盛大一季度总营收为11.07亿元人民币(约1.62亿美元)，其中网络游戏营收为10.62亿元人民币。游戏起家的陈天桥在今天对于游戏的情感似乎有些复杂，他曾试图把盛大的侧重点从网游带向“盒子”(即家庭娱乐战略)，但是却使得盛大业绩大减甚至出现巨亏，之后陈天桥即时调整策略，重回游戏，才有了今天盛大单季营收超10亿人民币的骄人业绩。但是陈天桥和盛大从未放弃做互动娱乐媒体的战略。目前盛大集团旗下拥有盛大游戏、盛大文学、盛大在线三大全资公司以及其它投资公司和业务。“就盛大目前的庞大资产群和日益纵深的业务架构来看，陈天桥需要另外的上市公司来承载一些业务模块，让盛大看起来更像是一个集团，而不仅仅是一个游戏公司。”赵旭枫说。外界猜测颇多的是盛大可能会借壳华友实现盛大文学上市。盛大文学2008年7月组建，整合了此前盛大收购的起点中文网、红袖添香和晋江原创网。目前，盛大文学已占全国原创版权网络文学市场80%的份额，营收已进入亿元级别。而此前的5月25日，盛大宣布旗下子公司盛大游戏已向美国证券交易委员会递交上市申请。因此，盛大文学很有可能也将谋求独立上市。对于买华友就是为了买壳上市的猜测，赵旭枫并不大赞同，“如果仅仅是为了借一个壳上市，对于盛大来说完全没有必要，而且如果仅仅是为了买一个壳，这个壳可能还贵了一点。”她认为，华友作为一家集电信增值服务(SP)、音乐及音乐剧制作、游戏、艺人经纪及新媒体等平台建设于一身的企业，盛大更可能是想借其众多的付费用户、与运营商的良好关系、成熟的团队和丰富的业界资源进入无线领域，争夺3G市场上的机会。“盛大早就收购了专门做手机游戏的数位红公司，起点中文网的付费阅读也可以整合到手机平台上，如果盛大能把华友SP业务以及音乐业务与这些资源整合起来，可能将来会有比较好的发展。”她说。目前，业界都相当看好手机游戏业务，其产业链已经基本成熟。根据艾瑞咨询的调查数据显示，2008年我国手机网游用户已经突破1.5亿，所以有人称手机游戏已经到了“井喷前夜”。特别是今年一季度，靠手机游戏的巨大推动，空中网在连续亏损近3年后首次盈利，实现营收近3000万美元，与历史最高峰值持平，极大了提升了业界对于手机游戏的关注。盛大当然更是没有理由看不到这样的趋势。整合艰难“以前盛大收购一些不大的网游公司都开价上千万美元，一个上市公司5000万都不到真的很便宜。”一位张先生告诉《中国经济周刊》，他是被盛大收购的一家公司的高层。但是“便宜”的华友“消化”起来可能没那么容易。赵旭枫认为盛大要想整合华友“其实挺难的”，因为只是得到一个控股权，要真正去影响、控制这个企业并不容易。根据华友公布的财报，2007年该公司净亏损4200万美元，2008年净亏损1200万美元，而2009年第一季度净亏损为210万美元。赵旭枫认为盛大的进入能否帮华友走出亏损的境地还很难说，“能帮他们多撑一段时间吧。”她认为华友的业务线是比较尴尬的，营利模式还不是非常的明确，业务也有断点，华友SP和手机音乐业务营利都不是很好，“华友业务线的未来大家都看好，但是目前来讲这些都是不赚钱的。”她说。另外一个更大的不确定性和挑战来自于国家的政策和3G的发展前景，“关于3G很多相关政策还没有最终确定，特别是资费，如果还是很贵，那估计这些东西都没戏。”赵旭枫说。“从盛大目前状况来看，还不太具备整合华友的能力。盛大的精力毕竟是有限的，华友的业务对于盛大来说又是陌生的业务。”张先生透露说，“盛大对于旗下这些收购的企业的整合力度其实是非常小的，很多时候就是给一笔钱，至于如何经营、怎样营利还是靠原来的经营者。但是这个公司是盛大的和是自己的，这种投入程度要差很多。”张先生说，“全资买下来都只是放在那边不管，更不要说是入股的。”不过外界的担心从某种角度看似乎并不必要。“此次盛大收购华友是通过二级市场进行的，这51%也都是可流通的股票，完全可以抛掉，只要高于现在买进的价格就不亏。”赵旭枫认为，“对于双方来说，这都不是一次绝对的收购，双方都是有余地、有保留的。”赵旭枫说，“此次收购本质上只是盛大来做华友的大股东，不像全资收购，买下来就要负责，又不能轻易卖掉，做不好就会变成不良资产。”2005年，当很多人看到盛大收购新浪的消息，都觉得陈天桥在“扯淡”，而他也的确无法进入新浪董事会，实现整合新浪资源为盛大所用的美好愿望。但不久之后，他卖掉新浪股票，成功抽身还转手赚了1亿多美元。于是，陈天桥再一次告诉大家，他绝不会是输家。	陈天桥,孙冰,王秦岱,董朝晖,诸葛辉,赵旭枫	正向	"After four years of coveting, Snda finally got Huayou: Sun Bing/Beijing reported that after many days of noise and the plot had turned several times between Snda and the independent consortium, Huayou finally received a generous offer from Snda. The acquisition is not news to Snda, which has been ""shopping"" everywhere in recent years, and the acquisition is even less news to Huayou, which has been losing money for many years and has been waiting for sale for a long time. However, the acquisition of an SP and a music company by the ""online game leader"" will still trigger countless fantasies from the industry and the public. On the evening of June 8, after four years of coveting, Snda Interactive Entertainment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Snda"") and Huayou Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as ""Huayou"") jointly announced: both parties have signed a formal agreement, agreeing that a wholly-owned subsidiary of Snda will initiate an offer to acquire 51% of the total number of Huayou's issued ordinary shares, with a total acquisition price of about $46.2 million. This acquisition price provides a premium of 25% compared with the share price on the trading day before Huayou (that is, June 5). The acquisition ratio of 51% is some distance from the previously rumored 80%, but the offer of $46.2 million is higher than the offer of $400 million from another buyer - the independent consortium led by Dong Zhaoxi, President of Joy Media. Previously, the independent consortium has always been the main part of Huayou's acquisition rumors. However, the Huayou Board of Directors rejected its acquisition offer, and the market reported that Snda joined in as a third party and was invited by Huayou's management. ""Acquiring Huayou is in line with Snda's consistent interactive entertainment media strategy,"" Ge Zhuohui, Snda's public relations director and spokesman, said in an interview with China Economic Weekly. ""Snda's consistent goal is to do interactive entertainment. We have been striving for this strategic direction. Acquiring Huayou is in line with this strategy, and we have always been evaluating and paying attention to similar strategic opportunities."" But Ge Zhuohui said it was inconvenient to disclose how Snda will integrate Huayou and other information. ""We respect the efforts made by the board of directors and management of Huayou in the past and the strategy and direction set for the future of Huayou. I believe that Huayou will achieve greater development with the support of Snda's users, resources and platforms."" He said, ""But at present, we have only put forward an intention and have not started a specific offer. This is a series of procedures. What we are doing now is the first step, that is, the two sides have signed such an agreement."" According to the reporter's understanding, it will take at least 20 trading days to complete the offer even if there is no change. The reporter tried to contact Huayou, but the phone of the relevant person in charge was not answered. Wang Qindai, Chairman of Huayou, has not yet appeared in front of the media. He only said in the official statement sent to the media: ""We believe that Huayou and Snda have a common vision to become leaders in the digital entertainment industry. The complementary content, distribution platform and user base of the two companies will provide huge synergy for the future development of both sides."" ""Snda is of course a better choice for Huayou."" Zhao Xufeng, an analyst at iResearch, told China Economic Weekly. ""The independent consortium can only provide some financial assistance to Huayou, and Snda can give Huayou some resources and help, let alone Snda's higher offer."" She said. According to a Snda insider who revealed to China Economic Weekly, as early as 2005, Snda had acquisition negotiations with Huayou, and almost reached an agreement. However, at that time, Snda was busy acquiring Sina. It had limited cash in hand and there were different opinions from the senior management, so it was not possible to go on. ""At that time, Huayou's stock price was about three times the current price. Now it is much cheaper to buy."" The person said. Just a cheap shell? Why is Snda so fascinated by Huayou, even for several years? Although it has always been aimed at ""Internet Disney"" and called itself an ""interactive entertainment company"", the public will still classify Snda as an online game company, and most of its revenue also comes from game business. According to Snda's 2009Q1 financial report, Snda's total revenue in the first quarter was 1.107 billion yuan (162 million US dollars), of which online game revenue was 1.062 billion yuan. Chen Tianqiao, who started his career in games, seems a little complicated about games today. He once tried to shift the focus of Snda from online games to ""box"" (that is, family entertainment strategy), but it made Snda's performance greatly reduced and even suffered huge losses. Later, Chen Tianqiao adjusted his strategy in time, returned to the game, and today Snda has a proud performance of more than 1 billion yuan in a single quarter. But Chen Tianqiao and Snda have never abandoned the strategy of interactive entertainment media. At present, Snda Group has three wholly-owned companies of Snda Games, Snda Literature, Snda Online and other investment companies and businesses. ""In view of the huge asset group and increasingly in-depth business structure of Snda, Chen Tianqiao needs another listed company to bear some business modules, so that Snda looks more like a group, not just a game company."" Zhao Xufeng said. The outside world speculated that Snda might borrow Huayou's shell to realize the listing of Snda Literature. Snda Literature was set up in July 2008, integrating the starting Chinese website, Hongxiu Tianxiang and Jinjiang Original Network, which were previously acquired by Snda. At present, Snda Literature has occupied 80% of the national original copyright online literature market, and its revenue has reached the billion yuan level. On May 25, the former subsidiary of Snda announced that Snda Games had submitted an application for listing to the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States. Therefore, Snda Literature is also likely to seek independent listing. For the speculation that Huayou was bought just to buy a shell for listing, Zhao Xufeng did not agree very much. ""If it is just for the sake of borrowing a shell for listing, there is no need for Snda at all. If it is just for the sake of buying a shell, the shell may be a little expensive."" She believes that Huayou, as an enterprise integrating telecom value-added services (SP), music and musical drama production, games, artist agency and new media platform construction, is more likely to want to use its many paying users, good relationship with operators, mature team and rich industry resources to enter the wireless field and compete for opportunities in the 3G market. ""Snda acquired Hongduo, a company specializing in mobile games, a long time ago. The paid reading of the starting Chinese website can also be integrated into the mobile phone platform. If Snda can integrate the SP business and music business of Huayou with these resources, it may have a better development in the future."" She said. At present, the industry is quite optimistic about the mobile game business, and its industrial chain has basically matured. According to the survey data of iResearch, the number of mobile online game users in China had exceeded 150 million in 2008, so some people said that mobile games had reached the ""eve of gushing"". In particular, in the first quarter of this year, relying on the huge promotion of mobile games, Air China made a profit for the first time after nearly 3 years of continuous losses, with a revenue of nearly 30 million US dollars, equal to the historical peak, which greatly increased the industry's attention to mobile games. Of course, Snda has no reason to miss such a trend. Integration is difficult. ""In the past, Snda offered tens of millions of dollars to acquire some small online game companies. It's really cheap that a listed company costs less than 50 million."" Mr. Zhang, a senior executive of a company acquired by Snda, told China Economic Weekly. But the ""cheap"" Huayou may not be so easy to ""digest"". Zhao Xufeng thinks that it is ""very difficult"" for Snda to integrate Huayou because it is only getting a controlling stake, and it is not easy to really influence and control the enterprise. According to the financial report published by Huayou, the company lost 42 million dollars in 2007, 12 million dollars in 2008, and 2.1 million dollars in the first quarter of 2009. Zhao Xufeng thinks it is hard to say whether Snda's entry can help Huayou get out of the loss. ""It can help them support for a longer time."" She believes that Huayou's business line is quite embarrassing, the profit model is not very clear, and there are breakpoints in the business. Huayou SP and mobile music business are not well profitable. ""Everyone is optimistic about the future of Huayou's business line, but these are not making money at present."" She said. Another greater uncertainty and challenge comes from the national policy and the development prospect of 3G. ""Many relevant policies about 3G have not been finally determined, especially the tariff. If it is still very expensive, I'm afraid these things are not worth trying."" Zhao Xufeng said. ""From the current situation of Snda, it is not yet capable of integrating"

The news that the hot spot of social game development market in China is attracting international enterprises to join in is constantly joining in. John Pleasants, CEO of Playdom, one of the three major social game developers on Facebook platform, said at the China Social Game Summit on Saturday that the company is preparing to set up an office in China and actively looking for more excellent developers and partners.

陕西新赛季竟“自废武功”省钱政策难掩危机四伏看透了易帜看不清前途这是换汤不换药的改变“没有新变化，怎么可能有新变化呢。老板还是原来的老板，思路还是原本的思路。这次陕西男篮的易帜，完全是换汤不换药的改变啊。”谈到陕西男篮由亚旅到锂源动力的变化时，一位知情者笑着说道。至少，在公开接受媒体采访时，就连锂源俱乐部的“掌舵者”梁瑞麟也没有否认这个事实。“投资方锂源动力与亚旅体育产业有限集团其实是一脉相承的关系。亚旅集团控股了珠海锂源动力，在珠海锂源动力的基础上又投资了唐山、长春和辽源三家锂源动力公司。这四家公司还与其他公司构成了中国锂源动力集团。既然俱乐部已经归亚旅了，锂源动力产品又是亚旅新的投资主业，球队的新名称就冠以锂源动力的名称。”既然与亚旅时代相比，如今的锂源动力完全堪称“新瓶装旧酒”，那么延续亚旅时代的思路，自然就是一件顺理成章的事情了，而这种思路就是省钱为先了。从去年季后赛的无外援“裸奔”，到大龙、张伟、陈照升、代勇的“一个不留”，再到如今的放走最后一位大佬。无论“培养新人”的招牌如何光鲜，但又怎能遮盖“自废武功”的事实。看不清前途这般决策锂源能成长吗“新赛季我们的口号是：锻炼新人。希望球迷和媒体理解我们，我们会全力以赴，但成绩肯定不如去年。”展望锂源男篮的新赛季时，新任主帅史利平这样说道。球队需要新人，而新人总需要成长时间，这些广大三秦球迷自然懂得、也理解。但要变这种“短痛”为不痛，这里面的“技术含量”却远不是说说口号就可以解决的问题。在多次和记者聊天时，“神奇教练”吴庆龙就曾多次表示，新人的培养必须尊重篮球运动的规律，要在保持他们自信心的基础上，通过比赛提高他们运用技战术动作的能力、临场发挥水平和应付比赛的经验。以锂源男篮目前的阵容，要指望这些大多数在二队时都没有“练到位”的年轻队员，短时间内承担起“挑大梁”的重任。到底是“揠苗助长”，还是“急功近利”呢？对此，多位CBA资深教练也表示，“现在陕西队这帮孩子，打青年联赛就是10名以后的水平，没有老队员的传、帮、带，冒冒失失地让他们打CBA，还不把他们打得连东西南北都分不清啊。”记者张勇	梁瑞麟,吴庆龙,张伟,陈照升,史利平,张勇,代勇,大龙	负向	"In the new season, Shaanxi Province actually ""wasted its own martial arts"", and the money saving policy is hard to hide the crisis. It is clear that the flag has changed, but it is unclear that this is a change of soup but not medicine. ""Without new changes, how can there be new changes. The boss is still the boss, and the idea is still the original idea. This change of the flag of Shaanxi Men's Basketball Team is a complete change of soup but not medicine."" When talking about the change of Shaanxi Men's Basketball Team from Yatoo to Lithium Source Power, an insider said with a smile. At least, Liang Ruilin, the ""helmsman"" of Lithium Source Club, did not deny this fact when he publicly accepted media interviews. ""The investor Lithium Source Power and Yatoo Sports Industry Group are actually a continuation of the relationship. Yatoo Group holds Zhuhai Lithium Source Power, and then invests in three lithium source power companies in Tangshan, Changchun and Liaoyuan on the basis of Zhuhai Lithium Source Power. These four companies, together with other companies, constitute China Lithium Power Group. Since the club has returned to Yatoo, Lithium Power Products is Yatoo's new main investment, and the team's new name is crowned with the name of Lithium Power."" Since Lithium Power in the era of Yatoo can be called ""new wine in old bottles"" compared with the era of Yatoo, it is natural to continue the thinking of the era of Yatoo, and the idea is to save money first. It is hard to see how such a decision of Lithium Source can grow? ""Our slogan for the new season is: to exercise newcomers. I hope fans and the media can understand us. We will do our best, but the results must be worse than last year."" Shi Liping, the new head coach, said when展望ing the new season of Lithium Source Men's Basketball Team. The team needs newcomers, and newcomers always need time to grow, which is naturally understood by these vast number of Qin fans. But it is not a problem that can be solved by saying slogans to change this ""short pain"" into no pain. When chatting with reporters for many times, ""Magic Coach"" Wu Qinglong has repeatedly said that the cultivation of newcomers must respect the rules of basketball. On the basis of maintaining their self-confidence, they should improve their ability to apply technical and tactical actions, their level of on-the-spot performance and their experience in dealing with games through competitions. With the current lineup of Lithium Source Men's Basketball Team, it is necessary to rely on these young players who have not ""practiced in place"" when they are mostly in the second team to bear the heavy responsibility of ""picking the backbone"" in a short time. Is it ""pulling seedlings to help them grow"" or ""seeking quick success and instant benefit""?

At the close of the morning trading, the Shanghai Composite Index was reported at 2612.04 points, down 1.26%, with a half-day trading volume of 61.9 billion yuan, which has an amplification trend. The ratio of the number of rising and falling shares is about 1:2. Without counting ST shares, 2 shares in Shanghai closed up and no shares closed down. The panel shows that the shares in the morning trading in the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell sharply, with less than 250 rising shares, and the weighted shares performed poorly, with only 10 of the 50 shares in the Shanghai Stock Exchange rising. In terms of sectors, only five sectors in the two cities rose. Stimulated by the resumption of trading of Changjiang Electric Power (600900.

公募基金集体失算金融股逆势加仓损失惨重重仓金融股使基金陷入尴尬的境地。据本报记者统计，在刚刚过去的这轮股市调整中，由于仓位中金融股(下跌中的领跌板块)占比过大，众多股票型基金净值缩水严重。加仓后现暴跌截至2009年四季度末，基金前七大重仓股全部为金融行业个股。其中，招商银行有208只基金持有，中国平安有205只基金持有，兴业银行有166只基金持有，民生银行有117只基金持有，中信证券有110只基金持有，浦发银行有96只基金持有，北京银行有94只基金持有。这一数字较2009年三季度有明显加仓的痕迹。基金对此的解释是，由于整个中小盘估值偏高，目前风险较大，因此进行减持。而金融行业个股是整个大盘中最为明显的估值低洼地带，加仓金融股有利于规避风险，同时有望获取超额收益。可惜的是，期望中的小盘股向大盘股的风格转换并未实现，基金此次再度成为暴跌前最后的接棒者。截至2月5日，基金前七大重仓的金融股中，除民生银行外全部都高于大盘10.31%的跌幅，其中中信证券、北京银行和兴业银行跌幅超过15%。本轮金融股的暴跌，使基金损失惨重。晨星数据显示，截至2月5日跌幅超过10%的基金数目已经超过120只，这些基金的重仓股也多为金融股。抱团取暖为何失效？但是值得注意的是，基金似乎不但选错了金融股，还选错了金融股中的公司。基金数目仅有9只的中国银行，今年以来跌幅仅有4.62%，是所有金融股中跌幅最浅的个股。基金数目不足5只的光大证券和招商证券，今年以来甚至出现上涨。保险行业中，基金数目最少的中国太保，跌幅也仅有8.82%，是惟一一只跌幅未超过10%的保险股。这也显示出，基金扎堆的金融股跌幅大于基金较少的金融股。基金抱团取暖非但没有成功，反而成为“累赘”。事实上，基金选择的金融股，就质地上来说一般高于基金较少的金融股。分析人士指出，基金“抱团取暖”失败的原因，是由于有的基金率先砸盘。因为金融板块基金较多，政策也较为透明，因此基金没有共同进退的可能。事实上，有分析指出，基金行业2009年的状元华夏大盘，就率先砸盘金融股，所以避过了本轮的惨跌。另一个原因是，从去年四季度末基金加仓幅度来看，该买金融股的基金都已经买得差不多了。因此，当有基金不断出货时，接盘的资金明显不够，金融股只能下跌。未来还得买金融股？不过，目前看来，基金对金融股的“贼心不死”。信达证券基金行业分析师李琛表示，从目前基金减仓的情况来看，单周减仓幅度也就1%左右，有时候还会出现加仓。这表明，除一小部分基金外，其余基金并未大幅减持金融股。从业绩上来看，尽管紧缩政策预期强烈，但是分析人士对金融行业的业绩预期却仍然稳定，这也是基金仍然不舍金融股的根本原因。“经过本轮下跌，现在基金看明白了，今年的股市很难指望有太高的收益，因此注意风险是第一位的。而金融股经过下跌，估值进一步下降。在政策明朗后，基金还是得买它，目的不是为了获取超额收益，而是为了得到平均的收益。”一位基金业内人士表示。商报记者陈洁	李琛,陈洁	负向	"The collective miscalculation of public funds in financial stocks is painful. The overweight of financial stocks makes the fund embarrassed. According to the statistics of this reporter, in the just past round of stock market adjustment, many stock funds suffered serious losses due to the excessive proportion of financial stocks (the leading decline sector in the decline). As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, the top seven overweight stocks of funds were all individual stocks of the financial industry. Among them, 208 funds hold China Merchants Bank, 205 funds hold Ping An of China, 166 funds hold兴业Bank, 117 funds hold Minsheng Bank, 110 funds hold CITIC Securities, 96 funds hold Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and 94 funds hold Beijing Bank. This figure has obvious traces of明显的ing in the third quarter of 2009. The fund's explanation for this is that since the valuation of the whole small and medium plate is too high and the current risk is too large, it should be reduced. Individual stocks of the financial industry are the most obvious low valuation area in the whole market. Adding financial stocks can help to avoid risks and hopefully earn excess returns. Unfortunately, the expected small cap stock style conversion to large cap stock has not been realized, and the fund has once again become the last to receive the baton before the collapse. As of February 5, all the top seven financial stocks of the fund were more than 10.31% lower than the market, except Minsheng Bank, including CITIC Securities, Beijing Bank and兴业Bank, with a decline of more than 15%. The collapse of financial stocks in this round has caused heavy losses to the fund. Morningstar data shows that the number of funds that have fallen more than 10% as of February 5 has exceeded 120, and their heavy position stocks are also mostly financial stocks. Why does the practice of huddling for warmth fail? But it is worth noting that the fund seems to have not only chosen the wrong financial stocks, but also the wrong companies in financial stocks. The number of China Bank's funds is only 9, and the decline this year is only 4.62%, which is the least decline of all financial stocks. Guosen Securities and China Merchants Securities, with less than 5 funds, have even risen this year. In the insurance industry, the number of China Pacific Insurance funds is the least, and the decline is only 8.82%, the only insurance stock whose decline has not exceeded 10%. This also shows that the financial stocks in which funds are clustered fall more than the financial stocks with fewer funds. The fund's抱团for warmth has not only failed, but also become a ""burden"". In fact, the financial stocks selected by funds are generally higher than the financial stocks with fewer funds in terms of quality. Analysts pointed out that the reason why the fund's ""group for warmth"" failed was that some funds took the lead in smashing the market. Because there are many financial sector funds and the policies are more transparent, it is impossible for funds to advance and retreat together. In fact, some analysts have pointed out that China's Huaxia Stock, the top student in the fund industry in 2009, took the lead in smashing financial stocks, so it avoided the tragic decline in this round. Another reason is that from the perspective of the increase in the fund's position at the end of last quarter, the funds that should buy financial stocks have almost been bought. Therefore, when funds are constantly delivering goods, the funds to receive them are obviously not enough, and financial stocks can only fall. Do we still have to buy financial stocks in the future? However, at present, the fund's ""thief's heart"" for financial stocks is not dead. Li Chen, a fund industry analyst of Cinda Securities, said that from the current situation of fund reduction, the single week reduction is only about 1%, and sometimes it will increase. This shows that, except for a small number of funds, other funds have not significantly reduced their holdings of financial stocks. In terms of performance, although the expectation of tightening policy is strong, the performance expectation of the financial industry is still stable, which is the fundamental reason why the fund still舍不得financial stocks. ""After this round of decline, the fund now realizes that it is hard to expect too high returns in this year's stock market, so risk is the first priority. However, after the decline of financial stocks, the valuation further decreased. After the policy is clear, the fund still has to buy it, not in order to obtain excess returns, but in order to get average returns."" An industry insider said. Chen Jie, a business reporter"
男子驾车撞人后又向伤者扔6枚燃烧汽油弹(组图)29日，沈阳发生的一起恶性事件引来恐惧、悲伤的同时，也引发了一串疑问。他撞人后烧车，往路人身上扔了6枚“汽油弹”，是为了什么？全身烧伤面积达到95%、在重症监护室里伤者，与行凶者是什么关系？有人猜测，这事是因寻仇报复而起。事发现场>>撞人后扔6枚汽油弹29日12时许，沈阳市铁西区保工街南十三路交通岗西侧20米处。两辆消防车停在路边，事发地被围上了警戒线。透过警戒线，一辆牌照为辽AY0548墨绿色吉普车停在现场，车辆已被烧穿，前后风挡玻璃被烧化，后车门附近有一瓶装有黄色透明质液体的白酒瓶子，瓶子旁边放着一个白色桶，车下有一只黑色皮鞋。距吉普车不到两米远的马路边石上，一些被烧黑的衣物残留物留在原地，一个银灰色的皮带头落在地上，皮带被烧化。据附近门市的目击者回忆，事情发生在11时30分许，一名男子驾驶该辆吉普车将一位男性路人撞倒，司机下车后发现人没死，又上车将两个玻璃瓶子往车下扔。“刚开始我们以为他要救人呢，后来发现连人带车全着了。”目击者说，当时躺在车下的人慢慢爬了出来，站起来后又倒下了。很多路过的人都围了过来，帮忙拨打120和119。一名目击者说：“他一直往路边爬，爬上了马路边石，我看见他的衣服、裤子都被火烧了，他自己反复在地上翻滚，想要灭火。”就在这时，吉普车司机又从车内取出了4个玻璃瓶子！另一名目击者描述，他看清楚了，司机扔的是汽油瓶，因为扔完之后路人身上的火更大了。”目击者说。还有目击者表示：“扔完瓶子之后，车里还飞出了好多百元大钞，大风把钱都刮飞了，我还看见有人捡呢。”很快，消防队员赶到了现场，迅速将吉普车的火扑灭，120急救车将伤者送往医院急救。肇事者失踪>>他是体格健硕的中年男子附近门市目击者说：“我们当时都顾着看被火烧的人了，谁也没注意肇事者跑哪去了？伤者被120送走后，大家才反应过来。”沈阳市铁西区刑警大队刑警在现场走访了大量门市，也没有得到任何有关于肇事者的消息。此时，一名老者拿着相机称，自己拍到了肇事者。但相机中只能看到一名年龄稍长，体格健硕的中年男子。15时许，肇事车被拖车拖走。16时45分，几名伤者家属跟随警方到公安部门做笔录。18时许，记者电话联系了出警的保工派出所，并在交通信息网上查询辽AY0548墨绿色吉普车，发现该车并没有违章记录，但根据车牌显示该车属于法库县。截至记者19时发稿时，肇事者还未抓到，案件还在进一步调查中。有人猜测，这事是因寻仇报复而起。伤者病情危重>>儿子哭喊“爸，一定要挺住！”29日13时许，记者在辽宁省武警总队医院住院部电梯间见到了刚刚做完放射检查的伤者。他脸色发黑，身上被一块白色塑料布包裹着，嘴角流出少量鲜血，额头鼓着一个大包。看到躺在病床上的父亲，儿子泣不成声：“爸，一定要挺住，挺住啊……”13时50分许，伤者被推进手术室，多名家属赶到医院。一名伤者家属告诉记者，伤者58岁，姓佟，以前在某工商所工作，现在自己在沈阳市于洪区开了一间家具厂，专门生产沙发，“他家就住在事发地附近，平时没听说跟什么人结仇啊？怎么能下手这么狠？”据医院接诊医生介绍，伤者全身大面积烧伤，其中90%为特重烧伤，病情危重，需要尽快手术。“我们考虑给伤者做个气管切开，伤者有吸入性损伤，应该是呼吸道出现了问题。”医生说，一般情况下，大面积烧伤的患者都需要抗感染治疗，如果被烧的皮肤受到感染，后期手术就会有麻烦。因为患者的年龄较大，医生安排三天后给患者做植皮手术，具体情况还要看患者恢复的程度。15时45分，伤者被推出手术室。医生表示，“今晚他会很危险，可能随时出现问题，需要送到ICU重症监护室接受治疗，这几天我们也会密切关注他的病情。”律师说法>>点火人涉嫌故意杀人罪辽宁诚铭律师事务所主任秦大军表示，案件中点火烧车的男子可能涉嫌故意杀人罪。他认为，如果吉普车驾驶人在撞到人后马上送伤者去医院，可能不会面对刑法的处理。但往路人身上浇汽油，就不是交通肇事罪了，而是刑事案件，涉嫌故意杀人未遂。“如果案件中肇事者精神有问题但没有精神残疾证的话，也同样需要负相应刑事责任”。此外，如果伤者最终不治身亡的话，肇事者将面临死刑的处罚。(本报综合)相关：沈阳发生点燃汽油瓶杀人案警方正抓捕嫌犯		负向	"A man hit someone with his car and then threw six gasoline bombs at the victim (picture) On the 29th, a恶性event in Shenyang caused fear and sorrow, and a series of questions. What did he do after he hit someone and burned his car, and threw six ""gasoline bombs"" at passers-by? What is the relationship between the victim, who was injured in the intensive care unit with 95% of his body burned, and the perpetrator? Some people speculate that this matter is due to revenge.>> At more than 12:00 on the 29th, 20 meters west of the traffic post on South Thirteen Road of Bao Gong Street, Tiexi District, Shenyang. Two fire engines were parked on the roadside, and the incident was surrounded with police lines. Through the cordon, a green jeep with a license plate of Liaoyay0548 stopped at the scene. The vehicle had been burned through, the front and rear windshields had been burned and melted, a bottle of white wine with yellow transparent liquid was near the rear door, a white bucket was placed beside the bottle, and a black leather shoe was under the car. Less than two meters away from the roadside stone near the jeep, some burnt black clothes remained in place, and a silver gray belt buckle fell to the ground, and the belt was burned. According to the eyewitnesses of the nearby store, at about 11:30, a man drove the jeep to hit a male pedestrian. After the driver got out of the car, he found that the man was not dead, and then got in the car and threw two glass bottles under the car. ""At first, we thought he was going to save people, but later we found that people and cars were all on fire."" The witness said that the person lying under the car slowly crawled out, stood up and fell down again. Many passers-by came around to help dial 120 and 119. An eyewitness said: ""He kept crawling to the roadside, climbed onto the curbstones, and I saw his clothes and trousers were burned. He rolled on the ground repeatedly to put out the fire."" At this moment, the driver of the jeep took out four more glass bottles from the car! Another witness described that he saw clearly that the driver threw a gasoline bottle, because the fire on the路人was bigger after it was thrown."" The witness said. Another witness said: ""After throwing the bottle, a lot of hundred dollar bills flew out of the car. The strong wind blew the money away. I saw someone pick it up."" Soon, the firefighters arrived at the scene and quickly put out the fire of the jeep. The ambulance sent the injured to the hospital for emergency treatment. The perpetrator disappeared>> He was a middle-aged man with a strong physique. The eyewitnesses of the nearby store said: ""At that time, we all took care of the people who were burned. No one noticed where the perpetrator ran? After the victim was sent away by 120, everyone recovered."" The criminal police大队of the criminal police detachment of Tiexi District, Shenyang, visited a large number of stores on the spot, but did not get any news about the perpetrator. At this moment, an old man with a camera said that he had taken a picture of the perpetrator. But the camera can only see a middle-aged man who is slightly older and strong. At 15:00, the towed car was towed away. At 16:45, several family members of the injured followed the police to the public security department to make a record. At 18:00, the reporter contacted the Baogong police station where the police were on duty and searched for the辽AY0548green jeep on the traffic information network, and found that the car had no traffic violation records, but according to the license plate, the car belonged to Faku County. At 19:00 when the reporter sent the manuscript, the perpetrator had not been caught, and the case was still under further investigation. Some people speculate that this matter is due to revenge. The patient's condition is critical>> The son cried, ""Dad, hold on!"" At about 13:00 on the 29th, the reporter saw the victim who had just finished radiotherapy in the elevator room of the inpatient department of the General Hospital of the Armed Police Force of Liaoning Province. His face was black, his body was wrapped in a white plastic cloth, a small amount of blood oozed from the corner of his mouth, and a large bag bulged on his forehead. Seeing his father lying on the bed, his son wept and said, ""Father, you must hold on, hold on..."" At about 13:50, the patient was pushed into the operating room, and many family members arrived at the hospital. A family member of the injured told the reporter that the injured was 58 years old, surnamed Tong. He used to work in a local industrial and commercial office. Now he opened a furniture factory in Yuhong District, Shenyang, specializing in the production of sofas. ""His family lives near the site. I haven't heard that he has made enemies with anyone? How can we be so cruel?"" According to the doctor who received the patient in the hospital, the patient was severely burned over a large area of his body, 90% of which was extremely severe, and his condition was critical, requiring prompt surgery. ""We consider giving the patient a tracheotomy. The patient has inhaled damage, which should be a respiratory problem."" The doctor said, in general, patients with large area burns need anti infection treatment. If the burned skin is infected, the later surgery will be troublesome. Because the patient is older, the doctor arranged for the patient to have a skin graft operation three days later, and the specific situation depends on the degree of recovery of the patient. At 15:45, the patient was pushed out of the operating room. The doctor said, ""He will be very dangerous tonight, and he may have problems at any time, so he needs to be sent to the ICU intensive care unit for treatment. We will also pay close attention to his condition in the coming days."" Lawyer's view>> The fire starter is suspected of intentional murder Qin Dajun, director of Chengming Law Firm of Liaoning Province, said that the man who set fire to the car in the case may be suspected of intentional murder. He believes that if the jeep driver sends the injured to the hospital immediately after hitting someone, he may not face criminal punishment. But pouring gasoline on passers-by is not a traffic accident but a criminal case, which is suspected of intentional homicide. ""If the perpetrator has mental problems but no mental disability certificate in the case, he also needs to bear corresponding criminal responsibility"". In addition, if the injured eventually die, the perpetrator will face the death penalty.

宁波银行：融资方式尚需斟酌新浪提示：本文属于研究报告栏目，仅为分析人士对一只股票的个人观点和看法，并非正式的新闻报道，新浪不保证其真实性和客观性，一切有关该股的有效信息，以沪深交易所的公告为准，敬请投资者注意风险。宁波银行处于快速扩张期，资本消耗较快。我们预计2009年末风险加权资产(RWA)将达到约850亿元，融资50亿元将提升核心资本充足率5.9个百分点至16.4%左右。按照RWA每年增长40%、ROA保持1.15%、派息率20%的假设，此次融资可以支持宁波银行2010-2012年的业务发展需要，对于风险加权资产回报率(RoRWA)较高的宁波银行来说，适时补充资本有利于长远发展和股东价值创造。但是融资方式还可以更加完善。首先，核心资本充足率和资本充足率的目标是否有必要保持在9%和12%以上还需探讨。其次，如果宁波银行适当降低分红比率，即使是2010年核心资本充足率也能保持在9%左右。在这种情况下进行股权融资对现有股东摊薄较大。此次增发4.3亿股后，EPS将摊薄17%，2010年ROE将从18.3%摊薄至14.7%。我们认为，核心资本充足率在8%-11%之间时，带有次级条款的可转债是比直接股权融资更好的资本补充方式。管理层应当在资本充足和股东回报之间寻找更好的平衡，充分利用杠杆。我们认同宁波银行在适当时机和适当方式进行的资本补充行为，尽管现行方案虽然补充核心资本的确定性较强，但一次摊薄幅度较大。虽然看好宁波银行的长期业务发展模式和管理能力，但短期内估值不具有吸引力。——摘自中金公司毛军华《宁波银行：融资有利长远发展，方式尚需斟酌》已有_COUNT_条评论我要评论	毛军华	正向	Ningbo Bank: Financing methods still need to be considered Sina Prompt: This article belongs to the research report column.

We expect that at the end of 2009, risk weighted assets (RWA) will reach about 85 billion yuan, and financing of 5 billion yuan will increase the core capital adequacy ratio by 5.9 percentage points to around 16.4%. Assuming that RWA grows by 40% per year, ROA remains at 1.15%, and the dividend payout ratio is 20%, this financing can support the business development needs of Ningbo Bank from 2010 to 2012. It is beneficial to the long-term development and shareholder value creation of Ningbo Bank, which has a high risk weighted asset return rate (RoRWA). However, the financing method can be further improved. First of all, it remains to be discussed whether it is necessary to keep the target of core capital adequacy ratio and capital adequacy ratio above 9% and 12% respectively. Secondly, if Ningbo Bank appropriately reduces the dividend ratio, even the core capital adequacy ratio in 2010 can be maintained at about 9%. In this case, equity financing has a greater impact on existing shareholders. After the additional issuance of 430 million shares, EPS will be diluted by 17%, and ROE in 2010 will be diluted from 18.3% to 14.7%. We believe that when the core capital adequacy ratio is between 8% and 11%, the convertible bond with subordination clause is a better way to supplement capital than direct equity financing. Management should find a better balance between capital adequacy and shareholder returns and make full use of leverage. We agree with the capital replenishment behavior of Ningbo Bank at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way. Although the existing plan has strong certainty of replenishing core capital, it is significantly diluted at one time. Although we are optimistic about the long-term business development model and management ability of Ningbo Bank, the valuation is not attractive in the short term. - Excerpt from Mao Junhua, China International Capital Corporation, Ningbo Bank: Financing is beneficial to long-term development, and the method still needs to be considered
ESPN名嘴称奥胖不如科比鲨鱼：再胡说出来单挑新浪体育讯　职业生涯最后730天(大鲨鱼准备再打两年就退役)，沙奎尔-奥尼尔选择加盟波士顿凯尔特人。在湖人功成名就的奥尼尔，此番转投死敌自然引来争议不小，ESPN脱口秀主持人吉姆-罗姆就在自己的节目中抨击了凯尔特人这一决定。“丹尼-安吉签下这名前湖人球员是个错误，哪怕只是用140万美元的老将底薪。”罗姆说道，“而且奥尼尔虽然15次入选全明星赛、手握4枚总冠军戒指，但从来都不如他的前队友科比-布莱恩特那么具有职业精神，不如科比对比赛那么投入。”这番言论可搞得沙克火大了，在微博(http://t.sina.com.cn)上奥尼尔马上展开了凶猛反击，“吉姆-罗姆，我对自己的职业生涯、对自己留下的荣耀都很满意，很显然你对自己的成就不是太满意，哦，对不起我忘了，你好像根本就没什么成就。”调侃了罗姆一番后沙克还不过瘾，他接着在微博上写道，“不如这样吧罗姆，咱们也别兜圈子了，你和我直接单挑，让ESPN直播，让全世界知道你是否只是一个嘴上强硬的软蛋！如果你赢了，我就把这个赛季的工资全部捐给慈善机构，具体是哪家你挑！”罗姆也不示弱，“得了吧沙克，如果你这个赛季挣800万那我还考虑一下，只是老将底薪？那我也太亏了，而且你好像跟我不是一个重量级吧？而且你刚才不还说我根本就没有成就吗？那你为什么还要屈尊和这样一个人单挑？”眼看打嘴仗有些吃亏，奥尼尔翻出了罗姆之前调戏NFL四分卫吉姆-埃维雷特打球像个娘们、结果被埃维雷特恐吓的视频，不过还是遭到了罗姆的反唇相讥。“要求助于他人啦？真无聊、真没劲，你怎么啦奥尼尔？你不是大亚里士多德吗？就这点水平？”罗姆在微博上写道。两人的微博唇枪舌剑目前暂时告一段落，奥尼尔加盟凯尔特人实战效果如何暂时未知，但可以预见不管球队有几巨头，奥胖都有本事成为镁光灯下的焦点......(贝吉塔)	沙奎尔-奥尼尔,沙克,科比,贝吉塔,科比-布莱恩特,吉姆-罗姆大亚里士多德,奥胖,吉姆-埃维雷特,吉姆-罗姆,科比-布莱恩特丹尼-安吉,奥尼尔,大鲨鱼	负向	"The ESPN commentator said that Shaquille O'Neal is not as good as Kobe Shark: If you mess up, fight Sina Sports News 730 days (Shaq prepares to retire in two years), Shaquille O'Neal chose to join the Boston Celtics. Shaquille O'Neal, who achieved fame and success in the Lakers, naturally caused controversy when he switched to the mortal enemy. Jim Rome, the talk show host of ESPN, criticized the Celtics' decision on his program. ""Danny Angji signed the former Lakers player for a mistake, even if it was only $1.4 million for the veteran's minimum salary."" Rome said, ""Moreover, although O'Neal has been selected for the All-Star game 15 times and has four championship rings in his hand, he has never been as professional as his former teammate Kobe Bryant, and he is not so committed to the game."" Shaquille O'Neal was very angry with this remark. On microblog (http://t.sina.com.cn), O'Neal immediately launched a fierce counterattack. ""Jim Rome, I am very satisfied with my career and the glory I have left. Obviously, you are not very satisfied with your achievements. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot that you don't seem to have any achievements."" After joking with Rome, Shaq was still not satisfied. He then wrote on his microblog, ""Come on, Rome. Let's don't beat around the bush. You and I will have a straight fight, let ESPN broadcast it to the world to see if you are just a tough mouthed soft egg! If you win, I will donate all my salary this season to the charity organization of your choice!"" Rome was not weak either. ""Come on, Shaq. If you make 8 million this season, I will consider it. Just the veteran's minimum salary? I'm too lost, and you don't seem to be in the same weight class with me? Moreover, you just said that I have achieved nothing? Then why do you want to degrade yourself to fight with such a person alone?"" Seeing that it is a bit unfair to have a quarrel, O'Neal found a video of Rome's previous teasing of NFL quarterback Jim Everett to play like a woman, which was later threatened by Everett, but he still received a sarcastic reply from Rome. ""Need help from others? Really boring, really boring, what's wrong with you, O'Neal? Aren't you Aristotle? Just this level?"" Rome wrote on his microblog. The microblog war between the two sides has come to a temporary end. It is unknown how O'Neal will join the Celtics in the actual battle, but it is foreseeable that regardless of the number of giants in the team, Shaquille O'Neal is capable of becoming the focus under the spotlight...

法国电信5年内投20亿欧元发展光纤本报讯法国电信日前宣布，法国电信监管当局ARCEP新的监管政策已经令他们有信心重新开始投资建设FTTH网络。从现在起到2015年，法国电信将投资20亿欧元在法国人口密集的主要地区开始FTTH建设。为了向零售和批发用户提供最高品质的电信服务，过去几年来法国电信每年用于网络建设的支出都高达30亿欧元以上。2007年以来法国电信已经部署了不少光纤接入设施，截至去年9月底，该公司发展了33000光纤用户。2009年9月，由于不满ARCEP当时的政策，法国电信宣布暂停光纤网络建设计划。此轮FTTH建设将会主要集中在巴黎等特大城市以外的地区。法国政府今年1月出台新政策鼓励电信运营商在中等城市建设FTTH网络，并表示愿意提供低息贷款。法国电信计划年内在戛纳、蒙彼利埃、奥尔良、斯特拉斯堡和土伦等城市开展网络建设。该公司表示欢迎其他运营商参与共同投资。截至2009年9月底，法国电信共有25.5万超宽带用户。(人民邮电报)		正向	France Telecom announced that the new regulatory policy of France Telecom regulatory authority ARCEP had made them confident to restart the investment and construction of FTTH network. From now on to 2015, France Telecom will invest 2 billion euros in the main densely populated areas of France to start FTTH construction. In order to provide retail and wholesale users with the highest quality telecommunications services, France Telecom has spent more than 3 billion euros each year on network construction in the past few years. Since 2007, France Telecom has deployed a number of fiber access facilities. By the end of last September, the company had developed 33000 fiber users. In September 2009, France Telecom announced a moratorium on the construction of fiber optic network due to dissatisfaction with ARCEP's then policy. This round of FTTH construction will mainly focus on areas outside mega cities such as Paris. In January of this year, the French government issued a new policy to encourage telecom operators to build FTTH networks in medium-sized cities and expressed willingness to provide low-interest loans. France Telecom plans to launch network construction in cities such as Cannes, Montpellier, Orleans, Strasbourg and Toulon within the year. The company said it would welcome other operators to participate in co-investment. By the end of September 2009, France Telecom had 255000 ultra broadband users in total.

腾讯近百万买下高朋域名团宝网借机出风头每经记者庄春晖发自上海全球最大团购网站Groupon通过与腾讯合资的方式进入中国市场，已经基本得到确认，2月14日，合资成立的“高朋网”的域名gaopeng.com已显示转至腾讯名下，据称交易价格为98万元人民币。高朋上线在即，不乏借机炒作者。紧握Groupon.cn中文域名的团宝网春节后即以Groupon的醒目抬头展开了对全国各大楼宇的广告轰炸；同时，国内团购网站“满座”也因成语“高朋满座”的合理联想，对“高朋”的“横刀杀出”颇有怨念，称将严防对方的任何侵权行为。Groupon入华初期，如何避免类似“真假开心网”姓名大战的再次上演，成了待解之题。中文名“过户”昨日，《每日经济新闻》记者通过whois查询gaopeng.com，发现该域名信息已经产生变化，显示现持有人为深圳腾讯计算机系统有限公司。信息显示，该域名生成于2001年，前任持有者为“中小学信息技术教育之家”，2010年6月经过续费，下一个租约到期日为2012年7月。据称，4个多月前，腾讯公司开始为该域名询洽，并以98万元人民币买下。“高朋”域名的变化证明了此前的业界消息。2011年1月初，Groupon入华意向曝光，Groupon决定暂时放弃收购独立团购网站，转而与腾讯公司合作。2月11日，消息称腾讯已与Groupon成立合资公司，公司注册资本1亿美元，双方各持50%。该团购合作项目的中文名定为“高朋”。团宝网拒绝合作许多业界人士都认为，“高朋”不是Groupon的最佳选择，但它别无选择，因为最合适的域名groupon.cn早已被国内团购网站团宝网占用。团宝网于2010年3月成立，号称上线2个月后就实现盈利，目前覆盖全国300多个城市。据团宝网CEO任春雷透露，2010年年底，Groupon高管一行曾来华与团宝网洽谈过入华合作及收购问题，遭到婉拒。今年年初，Groupon入华消息传出，团宝网借机大出风头。春节过后，该公司展开了对北京、成都等地的各大楼宇的广告轰炸，并宣布启动招聘2000人团队。高朋VS满座失去最佳中文域名的Groupon、腾讯两家公司，最终敲定合作项目中文名“高朋”，不料又横生枝节。业内质疑，国内已经有一家名为“满座”的团购网站，“高朋满座”的联想是否会混淆、转移消费者对“满座网”的印象？满座网CEO冯晓海表示不满。他称，满座网取“千里逢迎，高朋满座”之意，创办时为取名绞尽脑汁。“现在不能再保持沉默了，如果Groupon在华的宣传有任何对满座网的侵权行为，我们将奉陪到底。”	冯晓海,任春雷,庄春晖	正向	"Tencent nearly million buy Gaopeng domain name Tuobao com takes the opportunity to take the lead in the wind. Each journalist Zhuang Chunhui sent from Shanghai. Groupon, the world's largest group buying website, has basically confirmed that it will enter the Chinese market through a joint venture with Tencent. On February 14, the domain name gaopeng com of the joint venture ""Gaopeng com"" has been transferred to Tencent, with a transaction price of 980000 yuan. Gaopeng is about to launch, and there is no shortage of people who take the opportunity to speculate. Tuobao com, which holds the Chinese domain name Groupon. cn, immediately launched an advertising bombardment of major buildings across the country with the eye-catching headline of Groupon after the Spring Festival; At the same time, the domestic group buying website ""Full House"" also complained about the ""cross knife killing"" of ""High Pavillion"" because of the reasonable association of the idiom ""High Pavillion is full of seats"", and said that it would guard against any infringement of the other party. In the early stage of Groupon's entry into China, how to avoid the recurrence of the name war between ""true and false happy net"" became a problem to be solved. The Chinese name ""transfer"" Yesterday, the reporter of Nandu Commercial Daily inquired about gaopeng. Com through whois, and found that the domain name information had changed, showing that the present holder was Tencent Computer System Co., Ltd. of Shenzhen. The information shows that the domain name was generated in 2001, the former holder was ""Home of Primary and Secondary School Information Technology Education"", and the next lease expiration date was July 2012 after its renewal in June 2010. It is reported that more than four months ago, Tencent began to inquire about the domain name and bought it for 980000 yuan. The change of ""Gaopeng"" domain name proves the previous industry news. In early January 2011, Groupon's intention to enter China was exposed, and Groupon decided to temporarily give up the acquisition of independent group buying websites and turn to cooperate with Tencent. On February 11, it was reported that Tencent had set up a joint venture with Groupon, with a registered capital of US $100 million and 50% each. The Chinese name of the group buying cooperation project is ""Gaopeng"". Tuobao refused to cooperate. Many industry insiders believe that ""Gaopeng"" is not the best choice for Groupon, but it has no choice, because the most suitable domain name groupon. cn has been occupied by the domestic group buying website Tuobao. Tuobao was founded in March 2010, claiming that it realized profits two months after its launch, and now covers more than 300 cities in China. According to Ren Chunlei, CEO of Tuobao, at the end of 2010, Groupon executives once came to China to talk with Tuobao about cooperation and acquisition in China, but they were politely refused. At the beginning of this year, Groupon's news of entering China came out, and Tuobao took the opportunity to make a lot of money. After the Spring Festival, the company launched an advertising bombardment of major buildings in Beijing, Chengdu and other places, and announced the launch of a 2000 person team. Groupon, which lost the best Chinese domain name, and Tencent, finally decided on the Chinese name ""Gaopeng"" for the cooperation project, but unexpectedly, there were many branches. The industry questions whether there is a group buying website called ""Full House"" in China, and whether the association of ""Gaopeng is full of seats"" will confuse and transfer consumers' impression of ""Full House Network""? Feng Xiaohai, CEO of Full House Network, expressed dissatisfaction. He said that the purpose of Full House Network was to ""welcome thousands of miles, and it was hard to think of a name when it was created.""Now I can't keep silent. If Groupon's publicity in China has any infringement on Full House Network, we will accompany you all the way."""

NBA游戏中阿联乃奇才头牌大将军人气暴跌勉强入围新浪体育讯　北京时间9月10日消息，据ESPN报道，NBA新赛季还有2个月就要开打，而各种新款NBA游戏也即将发售。日前，ESPN专家马克-斯坦因通过个人途径提前获得了热门游戏《NBAJAM》的一些资料，现将原文摘译如下：《NBAJAM》是一个电视游戏，主要玩法是球星3对3斗牛，画风卡通，略带搞笑。目前大多数球队的阵容包括3名现役球员(都是球迷投票选出的人气球星)和一名传奇球星。有9支球队具备第四名现役球员，这是因为球迷的投票统计太过接近，游戏制作人员只能将这些人气明星都保留下来。此外还有一些球队没有传奇球星，这种情况通常有两种解释：1.球员的授权出现了问题(比如迈克尔-乔丹)；2.这支球队缺乏历史(比如夏洛特山猫)。此外，当游戏进行到一定程度后，玩家可以解锁一些隐藏的球员。令人惊喜的是，奇才竟是9支具备四名现役球员的球队之一，而易建联更是以超高的人气进入了奇才的3V3阵容。据斯坦因透露，奇才的现役球员阵容是易建联，安德雷-布莱切，吉尔伯特-阿里纳斯以及约翰-沃尔，而传奇球星则是已经故去的传奇中锋马纽特-波尔。虽然斯坦因并没有指明谁才是奇才人气最旺的球星，但根据其余球队的阵容排名推测，各支球队阵容的第一名理应是球迷投票选出的人气王。比如波士顿凯尔特人的阵容依次为凯文-加内特，保罗-皮尔斯，拉简-隆多以及雷阿伦；芝加哥公牛的阵容依次是德里克-罗斯，洛尔-邓，乔金-诺阿以及卡洛斯-布泽尔；迈阿密热火的阵容依次是德维恩-韦德，勒布朗-詹姆斯以及克里斯-波什。奥兰多魔术的阵容依次是德怀特-霍华德，文斯-卡特以及拉沙德-刘易斯。斯坦因表示，由于“持枪门”事件造成的恶劣影响，球迷投票中本没有阿里纳斯，但考虑到他的实力，制作人员最终仍将“大将军”加进了阵容。因此，奇才现在人气最旺的三名球员依次应该是易建联，布莱切以及沃尔。虽然阿联还没有为奇才打过比赛，但他居然已经成为奇才的人气球星，由此也可以看出阿联在美国球迷心中的地位。面对如此热情的球迷，阿联只能在新赛季用行动报答他们的厚爱了。(咕哒)	安德雷-布莱切,克里斯-波什,易建联,德里克-罗斯,勒布朗-詹姆斯,洛尔-邓,卡洛斯-布泽尔,保罗-皮尔斯,文斯-卡特,马纽特-波尔,拉沙德-刘易斯,拉简-隆多,乔金-诺阿,德维恩-韦德,雷阿伦,约翰-沃尔,凯文-加内特,德怀特-霍华德,阿里纳斯	正向	"In the NBA game, the popularity of Yi Jianlian, the top card of the Wizard's Army, slumped勉强to qualify for Sina Sports News On September 10, Beijing time, it was reported by ESPN that the new season of the NBA was only 2 months away, and all kinds of new NBA games were going to be released. Recently, Mark Stein, an ESPN expert, obtained some data of the popular game ""NBAJAM"" through personal channels in advance, and the following is an excerpt of the original text: ""NBAJAM"" is a television game, mainly played by three basketball players of the star, with a cartoon style and a little funny. At present, the lineup of most teams includes three active players (all popular stars voted by fans) and a legendary star. Nine teams have a fourth serving player because the voting statistics of fans are too close, and the game producers have to keep these popular stars. In addition, there are some teams without legendary stars, which is usually explained in two ways: 1. There are problems with the authorization of players (such as Michael Jordan); 2. This team lacks history (such as Charlotte Bobcats). In addition, when the game reaches a certain level, the player can unlock some hidden players. Surprisingly, the Wizards are one of the nine teams with four serving players, and Yi Jianlian has entered the 3V3 lineup of the Wizards with super popularity. According to Stein, the serving players of the Wizards are Yi Jianlian, Andre Blatche, Gilbert Arenas and John Wall, while the legendary star is the late legendary center Manute Bol. Although Stein did not specify who is the most popular star of the Wizards, it is speculated that the first place in the lineup of each team should be the King of Popularity voted by fans according to the ranking of the lineup of other teams. For example, the lineup of the Boston Celtics is Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo and Ray Allen; The Chicago Bulls are Derek Rose, Luol Deng, Joakim Noah and Carlos Boozer; The Miami Heat are Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh. The Orlando Magic are Dwight Howard, Vince Carter and Rashad Lewis. Stein said that due to the bad influence of the ""gun gate"" incident, there was no Arenas in the fans' voting, but considering his strength, the production personnel finally added the ""general"" to the team. As a result, the three most popular players of the Wizards now should be Yi Jianlian, Blatche and Wall in order. Although Yi has not played for the Wizards, he has surprisingly become the Wizards' popular star, which also shows Yi's status in the hearts of American fans. Faced with such enthusiastic fans, Yi can only repay their kindness with actions in the new season. (Guda)"
组图：弹头婚礼众星云集周杰伦精彩魔术表演新浪娱乐讯9月17日台北，南拳妈妈(听歌)弹头举办结婚喜宴，喜宴上众星云集，包括：TANK、杨宗纬(听歌)、黄立成(听歌)、李玖哲(听歌)、房祖名(听歌blog)、温岚(听歌blog)、杨千霈、林俊杰(听歌blog)、柯有纶等多名艺人全都到场祝贺，可见弹头夫妇在圈内人缘超好。晚间六点半开始，艺人陆陆续续进场，最令人意外的艺人身影就是成龙(听歌blog)的儿子房祖名，祖名表示今天晚上是来为自己将来的婚礼见习的，虽然不知道自己要在多少年以后才结婚，但是还是跟好朋友黄立成及李玖哲一起来参与婚礼，房祖名与黄立成及李玖哲三人是在美国就认识的多年好友，黄立成与李玖哲也分别说出了对新人祝福的话，他们是代表女方皮皮的好友，因为担任舞者的皮皮曾帮李玖哲伴过舞。林俊杰与柯有纶两人一同进场，看到好友弹头结婚两人也心痒想婚了，开出了一大堆择偶条件，柯有纶表示希望对方很会煮菜、又会做家事、又会写词、又可以陪她做音乐，十项全能的老婆让大家都怀疑柯有纶真的想结婚吗？而一旁的JJ则表示说，不论结婚对象是谁，只要是身心相爱的守护对方就好，也祝弹头与皮皮可以长长久久。在嘉宾都进场之后，紧接着要登场的是今晚的男女主角，今天一身正式礼服的弹头与穿着白纱的皮皮，两人从红毯的一端慢慢步向礼堂，在婚前许多八卦杂志说弹头是先有后婚，让两人的婚姻不受期待，弹头表示今后会用时间来证明她俩是真心相爱的，讲到师父今天大力跨刀，弹头心存感激的说：“二十岁以前都是父母在照顾我，二十岁以后都靠周董大力提拔。”对于师父周杰伦(听歌)的感激之情全都写在脸上。今晚最大的高潮就在于唱片公司杰威尔的大老板周杰伦现身表演魔术，一连三段的魔术表演有变出新娘、人体漂浮、还有?袋生酒杯，大家都知道周董爱表演魔术，今天会在婚礼上表演，周杰伦表示是因为弹头的要求，也是因为即将发行的新专辑中MV将以魔术表演的形式呈现，所以周董最近勤学魔术，访问到一半周董就忍不住技痒，拉起身旁的宣传即兴表演一段。说到弹头要结婚周董先是吓傻了眼，杰伦表示其实弹头才小他没几岁，对他来说结婚还是遥远的事，他预计自己是在35岁时结婚，看到弹头闪电结婚，杰伦表示真的出乎意料之外，因为他原本以为弹头跟皮皮只是玩一玩很快就会分了，没想到竟然会结婚，也让他破功送出了欧洲蜜月旅行的礼物，因为周董原先不看好两人会结婚，所以夸口说如果结婚就送欧洲蜜月旅行，现在让弹头赚饱了，不仅有免费的巨星表演、结婚大红包、还有欧洲蜜月行，看来有个有钱有势的师父是很吃香的。周杰伦也透露自己新专辑即将在十月份发行，新专辑的曲风一样是周式风格，结合了魔术表演，杰伦表示新专辑中，他希望化身为疗伤歌王，里头收入了许多情歌，要拯救现在许多失恋男女的心，周式情歌将在下个月引爆。TUNGSTAR/文并图	黄立成,周杰伦,李玖哲,林俊杰,杨宗纬,周董,成龙,杰伦,房祖名,柯有纶,弹头,皮皮,温岚,杨千霈	正向	"Group picture: The bullet wedding was attended by many stars, including Jay Chou's wonderful magic show Sina Entertainment News On September 17, Taipei, Nanquan Mama (listening to music) held a wedding banquet. The wedding banquet was attended by many stars, including: TANK, Yang Zongwei (listening to music), Huang Lizheng (listening to music), Li Jiuzhe (listening to music), Jackie Chan (listening to music blog), Johnny Yuen (listening to music blog), Lin Junjie (listening to music blog), Ke Youlun and many other artists all came to congratulate, which shows that the bullet couple has super good popularity in the circle. At 6:30 in the evening, the artists kept coming in. The most unexpected figure of the artist was Jackie Chan's son Fang Zuming. Zuoming said that tonight was for his future wedding. Although he did not know how many years later he would get married, he still joined his good friends Huang Lizheng and Li Jiuzhe to participate in the wedding. Fang Zuming and Huang Lizheng, and Li Jiuzhe are old friends who have known each other in the United States for many years. Huang Lizheng and Li Jiuzhe also said that they were good friends of Pi Pi, a female dancer who used to help Li Jiuzhe dance. Lin Junjie and Ke Youlun came in together. Seeing that their good friend Bullet got married, they also wanted to get married. They opened a lot of conditions for choosing a spouse. Ke Youlun said that he hoped the other party was good at cooking, doing housework, writing lyrics and making music with her. The versatile wife made everyone doubt whether Ke Youlun really wanted to get married? JJ, on the other hand, said that no matter who the marriage partner is, as long as he loves and guards each other, he also wishes that Bullet and Pi can last forever. After the guests have entered the venue, the next one to come on is the hero and heroine of tonight. The Bullet in a formal dress and Pi in a white veil slowly walk to the church from one end of the red carpet. Many gossip magazines said that the Bullet is the first and then the wedding, which makes their marriage not expected. The Bullet said that he will prove that they are truly in love with time in the future. Speaking of the master's great efforts today, the Bullet said gratefully: ""Parents took care of me before I was 20 years old, and I have been relying on President Zhou to promote me since I was 20 years old."" Jay Chou (listening to music) wrote all his gratitude on his face. Tonight's climax lies in the fact that Jay Chou, the big boss of the record company Jielun, shows up to perform magic. There are three consecutive magic performances, including the transformation of the bride, human body floating, and? Bag wine glass, everyone knows that President Zhou loves magic. Today, he will perform at the wedding. Jay Chou said it was because of Bullet's request, and also because the music video of the new album to be released will be presented in the form of magic performance, so President Zhou has recently been diligent in learning magic. When he was half way through the interview, President Zhou could not help scratching his itch and pulled the publicity beside him to improvise. Speaking of Bullet getting married, President Zhou was first scared. Jay Chou said that in fact, Bullet was only a few years younger than him. For him, marriage is still a distant thing. He expects to get married at the age of 35. Seeing that Bullet is getting married, Jay Chou said it was really unexpected, because he originally thought that Bullet and Pi Pi were just playing and would soon break up. Unexpectedly, they would get married, which also made him give away the gift of honeymoon in Europe, because President Zhou originally didn't think that the two would get married, so he boasted that he would give a honeymoon trip to Europe if he got married. Now, Bullet has made a lot of money. He has not only free superstars' performances, wedding hongbao, but also honeymoon in Europe. It seems that having a rich and powerful master is very popular. Jay Chou also revealed that his new album will be released in October. The style of his new album is still the style of Jay Chou, combined with magic performance. Jay Chou said that in his new album, he wanted to transform himself into a healing song king, which contained many love songs to save the hearts of many men and women who are in love now. The style of love song will be detonated next month. TUNGSTAR/"
IPO重启担忧升温调整幅度合理华讯财经[华讯财经6月5日收评：]受到外围市场及昨日尾盘的发飙的影响，周五沪深两市双双高开，在权重类股的推动下，大盘再创近期反弹新高，但逼近2800点附近时上行压力略有显现之后市场出现了强势震荡调整的趋势，由于IPO新规征集意见今日截至，各方力量趋于谨慎，但尾盘钢铁、金融带头杀跌，大盘迅速翻绿，两市5日均线险些失守。从盘面观察，个股跌多涨少，涨跌比率约为3：5，板块方面，酿酒、造纸、船舶、农林等板块表现相对较强，水泥、电力、金融、地产、钢铁等表现较弱。消息面上，工信部发布船舶工业调整和振兴规划；09年政府公共投资资金下达61.9%；新股IPO征求意见今截止重启窗口来临；中铝195亿美元注资力拓被曝告吹；5月份主要宏观指标不乐观已出现滞胀典型先兆；五电力集团敲定山东电煤合同涨幅低于煤企要求；铁矿石谈判又添变数：必和必拓再推指数定价等。华讯财经认为，周五大盘继续维持高位震荡态势，由于受IPO新规征集意见今日截至市场对IPO重启担忧升温，尾盘大盘出现一波杀跌，两市股指迅速翻绿，有考验5日均线支撑的欲望。整体来看，市场震荡调整尚在合理范围，投资者不必过于担忧，预计大盘短期内将维持震荡格局。操作上，注意个股波段运作，对于升幅较大的个股可适当减持，而重点关注具有补涨潜力的个股机会。		正向	The concern about the restart of IPO is rising and the adjustment is reasonable. Huaxun Finance [Huaxun Finance June 5 Review:]受外围市场和 yesterday's tailing market, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets both opened high on Friday. Under the promotion of weighted shares, the market hit a new high of recent rebound. However, when it approaches 2800 points, the market shows a trend of strong shock adjustment under the pressure of going up. Since the new IPO rules are due to solicit opinions today, all forces tend to be cautious. However, at the end of the market, steel, finance and other sectors led the decline, and the market turned green quickly. The 5-day moving average of the two cities is almost lost. From the observation of the market, there are more individual stocks falling than rising, and the ratio of rising to falling is about 3:5. In terms of sectors, the wine making, paper making, shipbuilding, forestry and other sectors performed relatively well, while the cement, power, finance, real estate, steel and other sectors performed relatively weak. In terms of news, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued the shipbuilding industry adjustment and revitalization plan; 61.9% of public investment funds were issued by the government in 09 years; the window for restarting the IPO came to an end today; the $19.5 billion investment of Chinalco in Rio Tinto was exposed; the main macro indicators in May were not optimistic, and stagflation was a typical omen; the five power groups confirmed that the Shandong coal contract rose less than the requirements of coal enterprises; there were more changes in the iron ore negotiation: BHP Billiton launched the index again Pricing and so on. Huaxun Finance believes that on Friday, the market continued to maintain a high level of volatility. Due to the fact that the IPO new rules are due to solicit opinions today, the market is worried about the restart of IPO, and the market shows a wave of killing at the end of the market, and the stock indexes of the two cities turn green quickly, with a desire to test the support of the 5-day moving average. On the whole, the market shock adjustment is still within a reasonable range, and investors need not worry too much. It is expected that the market will maintain a volatile pattern in the short term. In terms of operation, pay attention to the band operation of individual stocks. You can appropriately reduce the individual stocks with the largest growth, and focus on the opportunity of individual stocks with the potential of making up.
日本阿含桐山杯张栩轻松夺冠实现三连霸将战古力新浪体育讯　点击观看棋谱北京时间11月15日，第15届日本阿含-桐山杯围棋快棋赛在京都阿含宗总本山的“蜗牛庵”落子，结果卫冕冠军张栩九段执白2目半击败高梨圣健八段，实现日本阿含-桐山杯三连冠。他将在2009年1月17日和中国阿含-桐山杯冠军古力九段进行中日冠军对抗赛。张栩九段是国际棋界公认的日本围棋实力第一人，其快棋功夫尤其了得，目前保持着日本阿含-桐山杯、NHK杯两大快棋赛的冠军头衔，在另一快棋赛龙星战中也曾两次夺冠。高梨圣健八段则没有张栩那么辉煌的战绩，他自1988年入段以来，除了在2001年获得第31届新锐淘汰赛冠军以外，再无任何拿得出手的表现。在本届阿含-桐山杯中，高梨八段运气甚佳，从预选赛中杀出后分到了相对较弱的上半区，并且本区两名强手山下敬吾棋圣和高尾绅路九段都早早被淘汰；张栩则在强手如林的下半区连续击败了“金童”井山裕太、二十五世本因坊赵治勋、关西棋界第一人结城聪。从双方的实力和往绩来看，张栩名人、小棋圣占有绝对的优势。本局双方都以二连星开局。近期张栩名人的棋风偏向极端的先捞后洗，总是在开局就占据大量实地，随后打入对手的大模样一决胜负，这一战也不例外。双方第一次折冲从左下角展开，迅速形成了张栩取地、高梨取势的格局，面对强敌的高梨圣健八段筑起一道外势后又连占两个星位，颇有昔日武宫“宇宙流”的风格。而张栩当然不惧，白24挂入黑阵，双方在右下角进入第一次战斗。面对张栩名人充满自信的战法，高梨八段显得相当谨慎，频频长考，尤其白28强硬地靠出显然出乎高梨圣健的意料，当黑棋决定29虎住时，黑棋的保留时间已经用掉了将近三分之一，而此时张栩用时还不到10分钟。可以看出，面对职业生涯中首个夺得大棋战冠军的机会，高梨圣健在思想上还是比较保守。黑棋选择了保住右边实地，此后又侵入左下角成活，但代价是中央厚势反过来变成了孤棋。此时张栩敏锐地动出右边伏兵，高梨在应对中不够强硬，结果白棋连续拔花，架起铜墙铁壁后对中腹黑大块形成巨大威胁。攻守既然已经逆转，高梨圣健干脆一条道走到黑，脱先守右上角，彻底转向实地，以中腹治孤当作赌胜负的筹码。但是张栩也不强行进攻，同样在守住左上角后渗透进黑棋上方，保持实地的领先。几个回合下来，上边黑地变白地，而黑棋虽然加厚了中腹，但对铁桶一般的白棋并无太大威胁。至此棋局进入白棋略优的细棋格局，官子争夺中张栩下出了白122的破空好手，黑棋寄予厚望的中腹被破，高梨圣健无力争胜，虽然坚持收完了官子，但结果早已无法改变。张栩夺得本届日本阿含-桐山杯冠军后，实现了在这一赛事中的3连冠，获得1000万日元冠军奖金。他将在2009年1月17日和中国阿含-桐山杯冠军古力九段进行中日冠军对抗赛，届时新浪网将继续带来现场直播和报道，敬请广大棋迷网友关注！(胡恒日本京都报道)	胡恒,张栩,古力,井山裕太,高尾绅路,赵治勋,山下敬吾,武宫,结城聪,高梨	正向	"In the 15th Japanese Aohan-Tongshan Cup Go Fast Chess Tournament in the ""Snail Hermitage"" of the General Department of Aohan Tongzong, Kyoto, Zhang Xu, the defending champion, defeated Gao Li Shengjian, the eight segment of the white two and a half eyes, to win the Japanese Aohan-Tongshan Cup for three consecutive championships. On January 17, 2009, he will play against Gu Li, the nine-time champion of China's Aohan Tongshan Cup, in the China Japan Champions Cup. Zhang Xu, a nine segment of the world chess community, is recognized as the number one Japanese chess player in the world. His quick chess skills are particularly remarkable. At present, he is keeping the championship titles of the two major quick chess tournaments of the Japanese Aohan Tongshan Cup and the NHK Cup. He has also won the championship twice in another quick chess tournament, the Longxing War. Gao Li Shengjian, an eighth degree blacksmith, did not have Zhang Xu's glorious record. Since his career in 1988, except that he won the 31st New Sharp Elimination Championship in 2001, he had nothing to show for it. In this Aohan Tongshan Cup, Gao Li, an eighth degree student, was very lucky. After escaping from the preliminaries, he was assigned to the relatively weak upper half of the region, and two strong players in this area, Yama Xia Jingwu and Gao Weisenlu, were eliminated early; Zhang Xu successively defeated ""Jintong"" Jing Shan Yutai, Zhao Zhixun, the twenty-fifth generation of Benyuanfang, and Guanxi, the first chess player in the world, in the strong lower half of the world. In terms of both strength and past performance, Zhang Xu, a famous small chess saint, has an absolute advantage. Both sides started with a two star game in this game. Recently, Zhang Xu's chess style tends to be extremely捞after washing first. He always occupies a lot of land at the beginning, and then enters the opponent's big figure to win, which is no exception in this battle. The first battle between the two sides started from the lower left corner, and quickly formed a pattern of Zhang Xu taking the ground and Gao Li taking the situation. In the face of the strong enemy, Gao Li Shengjian built an external position and then occupied two star positions, with the style of the former Wugong ""Universe Stream"". Of course, Zhang Xu was not afraid. The white 24 hung into the black array, and the two sides entered the first battle in the lower right corner. In the face of Zhang Xu's self confident way of fighting, Gao Li, an eighth degree student, seemed quite cautious, frequently thinking for a long time. In particular, the tough white 28 was obviously unexpected by Gao Li Shengjian. When the black chess decided to hold the tiger at 29, the reserved time of the black chess had been used up nearly one third, while Zhang Xu used less than 10 minutes at this time. It can be seen that Gao Li Shengjian is still conservative in terms of ideology in the face of the opportunity to win the championship of the major chess battle for the first time in his career. The black chess chose to keep the right side of the real ground, and then invaded the lower left corner to survive, but the price was that the central thick potential turned back into an isolated chess game. At this time, Zhang Xu敏锐moved out the right flank, and Gao Li was not tough enough in dealing with it. As a result, the white chess game pulled flowers continuously. After building a copper wall and iron wall, it formed a huge threat to the black belly. Since the attack and defense has been reversed, Gao Li Shengjian simply went to the black one way, broke free to guard the upper right corner, and completely turned to the real ground, treating the isolation of the central abdomen as a bet on victory. But Zhang Xu did not force an attack either, but infiltrated into the black chess above after guarding the upper left corner, maintaining the lead in the real ground. After a few rounds, the black land on the top became white, and although the black chess thickened the abdomen, it was not a big threat to the iron bucket like white chess. At this point, the game entered a detailed chess pattern with a slight advantage of white. In the struggle for officials, Zhang Xu made a good move of Bai 122 to break the air. The promising abdomen of the black chess was broken, and Gao Li Shengjian had no chance to win. Although he insisted on finishing the game, the result had already changed. After Zhang Xu won the championship of this Japanese Aohan Tongshan Cup, he achieved a three consecutive championships in this event and won the championship prize of 10 million yen. On January 17, 2009, he will play against Gu Li, the nine-time champion of China Aohan Tongshan Cup, in the China Japan Champions Cup. At that time, Sina.com will continue to bring live broadcasts and reports. Please pay attention to the vast fans and netizens! (Hu Heng, Kyoto, Japan)"

全英音乐奖三大改革新主席新气象(图)新浪娱乐讯北京时间2月16日消息，据国外媒体报道，当地时间2月15日晚，第31届全英音乐奖颁奖典礼在伦敦举行。新上任的主席大卫·约瑟夫对本届大奖进行了一系列改革，从评委团成员、奖杯设计到颁奖典礼，形成了一番新的气象。评委团组成改革，影响大奖归属第一届全英音乐奖举办于1977年，从1982年开始成为一年一度的音乐盛事。全英音乐奖有“英国的格莱美”之称，但是近年来被批评提名呆板，奖项归属缺乏惊喜。新主席大卫·约瑟夫由此在今年进行了改革，不但颁奖典礼的举办地点首次从伦敦的伯爵宫迁至O2体育馆，评委团成员也进行了改革。以往的1000名评委是由音乐制作人、出版商和零售商组成的，今年首次加入了一批音乐艺人。最终使大奖归属指向了与以往不同的方向。民谣艺人此次受到格外的重视，劳拉·玛琳意外击败强劲的对手谢莉尔·科尔、艾丽·戈尔丁，成为“英国最佳女艺人”，新人乐队曼福德及子弟的首张专辑《SighNoMore》赢得最令人垂涎的大奖——“英国年度专辑”。尽管一直得到评论界的好评以及主流媒体的关注，玛琳新专辑《ISpeakBecauseICan》在英国榜单的最好成绩只是第4名。主要成员马库斯·曼福德也对自己的乐队能够获得大奖感到“惊异”，作为伦敦本土乐队，这还是他们在英国电视网的首次重要亮相。为之颁奖的是谁人乐队的罗杰·达尔特里，他致辞时说：“很高兴看到英国音乐工业还有足够的钱来举办一场狂欢派对。”大卫·约瑟夫的改革虽然体现出左倾倾向，却并没有脱离主流的需求。青春偶像贾斯汀·比伯获得“国际最具突破艺人”便是最好的证明。昔日以男孩乐队出道的接招也在不惑之年迎来了首个全英音乐奖“最佳英国组合”。尽管乐队曾多次获得全英音乐奖，成员罗比·威廉姆斯是获得该奖次数最多的艺人，接招之前却从未得到过“最佳英国组合”。他们的事业曾经如日中天，在不欢而散后，威廉姆斯开始了成功的个人事业。2005年乐队的其余四名成员重组，他们举办了英国历史上最大规模的巡演，门票在几分钟内抢购一空；他们的专辑《Progress》发行首日销量超过23万，打破绿洲乐队的纪录，成为英国销售最快的专辑。八个月前，威廉姆斯终于抛却前嫌重回乐队。颁奖典礼上，乐队上演了感人的一幕。成员马克·欧文抽泣着对威廉姆斯说：“小罗，感谢你回来加入我们。”奖杯重新设计，融入国旗元素本届全英音乐奖的奖杯由英国时尚达人薇薇安-维斯特伍德(VivienneWestwood)重新设计，手持盾牌的金属女神变成了身着英国国旗图案礼服的美人。在奖项的设置上，7个英国国内奖和6个国际奖几乎平分秋色，但是本届全英音乐奖似乎更重视对本土优秀艺人的奖励。说唱歌手TinieTempah和PlanB都来自伦敦。22岁的TinieTempah去年刚发行了首张专辑《Disc-Overy》，此次就获得了“英国最具突破艺人”和“英国最佳单曲”两项大奖。他在领奖时说，要把荣誉献给代表“和平与爱”的英国音乐。PlanB凭借概念专辑《TheDefamationofStricklandBanks》成功转型，不但成为英国专辑榜的冠军，还获得了本次“英国最佳男艺人”。在国际奖项上，加拿大摇滚乐队拱廊之火成为最大赢家，包揽“国际最佳组合”、“国际最佳专辑”两个大奖。两天前他们刚刚凭借新专辑《郊外》获得格莱美“年度专辑”奖。主唱魏因·巴特勒发表感言时特意感谢了曾经影响他们的英国乐队：“从新秩序到大卫·鲍伊、TheClash、CultureClub、赶时髦和TheSmiths。感谢英国，非常感谢！”他还建议不熟悉他们的英国观众可以到网络上搜索一下。颁奖典礼刻意编排，注重现场演出罗杰·达尔特里把全英音乐奖颁奖典礼形容成狂欢派对，那已经是历史了。以往的典礼确实只是观礼者的自娱自乐，台下不是成排的坐席而是一桌桌盛宴。这次尽管餐桌没有变，O2体育馆却比伯爵宫更像演出场所，而非宴会举办地。本届典礼更加注重演出效果，节目的衔接也更为紧凑。接招献上了开场秀，这也许是全英音乐奖颁奖典礼上男性演员最多的开场演出。一群打扮成防暴警察的舞者围绕在五名成员周围，暗指英国前不久的学生抗议事件。热辣的舞蹈伴随着男舞者们的脱衣秀，引得台下笑声阵阵。PlanB献上了新专辑的歌曲串烧，其中还穿插烈火焚身的特技表演。获得“国际最佳男艺人”的美国说唱歌手CeeLoGreen在闭幕演出中演唱了他的大热单曲《ForgetYou》，与之合作的是获得“英国最佳女艺人”提名的帕洛玛·菲丝。之前的格莱美之夜，他刚刚和好莱坞女星格温妮丝·帕特洛合作表演了这首歌。参加演出的还有拱廊之火、曼福德及子弟、TinieTempah、“国际最佳女艺人”得主蕾哈娜，没有被提名的女星艾薇儿·拉维尼和阿黛勒也献上了精彩的演唱。艾薇儿、谢莉尔·科尔、迪兹·拉斯可还担任了颁奖嘉宾。Linden/文	魏因·巴特勒,马克·欧文,David,劳拉·玛琳,谢莉尔·科尔,马库斯·曼福德,贾斯汀·比伯,薇薇安-维斯特伍德,艾丽·戈尔丁,帕洛玛·菲丝,TinieTempah,罗比·威廉姆斯,PlanB,罗杰·达尔特里,大卫·约瑟夫,威廉姆斯	正向	"The three major reforms of the new chairman of the All England Music Awards (picture) Sina Entertainment News reported on February 16, Beijing time. According to foreign media reports, the 31st All England Music Awards ceremony was held in London on the evening of February 15. David Joseph, the newly appointed chairman, has made a series of reforms to this year's award, from the members of the jury, the trophy design to the award ceremony, forming a new trend. The jury reform has an impact on the first all England Music Award, which was held in 1977, and has become an annual music event since 1982. The All England Music Awards are known as ""the Grammy Awards of the United Kingdom"", but in recent years, they have been criticized for being rigid and lacking surprises. The new chairman, David Joseph, therefore carried out reforms this year. Not only was the venue of the award ceremony moved from the Earl Palace in London to the O2 Gymnasium for the first time, but the members of the jury also underwent reforms. In the past, 1000 judges were composed of music producers, publishers and retailers. For the first time this year, a group of musicians were invited to join. It eventually pointed to a different direction from the past. Folk artists have received special attention this time. Laura Marling unexpectedly defeated strong opponents Cheryl Cole and Ellie Goulding to become the ""best female artist in the UK"". The debut album of the new band Mumford & Sons, Sigh No More, won the most coveted award - ""UK Album of the Year"". Although Marion's new album ""ISpeakBecauseICan"" has received good reviews and attention from the mainstream media, it has only achieved the best result of No. 4 in the UK chart. Marcus Mumford, the main member, was also ""amazed"" that his band could win the award. As a native band of London, it was their first major appearance on the British television network. Roger Daltrey of Who Band presented the award. He said in his speech: ""I'm glad to see that the British music industry still has enough money to hold a carnival party."" Although David Joseph's reform shows a left-wing tendency, it does not deviate from the mainstream needs. The youth idol Justin Bieber's ""most breakthrough international artist"" is the best proof. The former boy band also welcomed the first ""Best British Band"" in its forties. Although the band has won the All England Music Award many times, Robbie Williams, a member of the band, is the artist who has won the most awards, but he has never won the ""Best British Band"" before. Their career was at its peak. After an unhappy breakup, Williams began a successful solo career. The other four members of the band reorganized in 2005. They held the largest tour in British history, and the tickets were snapped up in minutes; Their album Progress sold more than 230000 copies on the first day of its release, breaking the record of Oasis Band and becoming the fastest selling album in the UK. Eight months later, Williams finally put aside his grievances and returned to the band. At the awards ceremony, the band performed a moving scene. Member Mark Owen sobbed to Williams: ""Little Rob, thank you for coming back to join us."" The trophy was redesigned to incorporate the national flag elements of this year's trophy of the All England Music Awards, which was redesigned by the British fashion expert Vivienne Westwood. The metal goddess holding a shield has become a beauty dressed in the British flag pattern dress. In terms of award setting, seven domestic awards in the UK and six international awards are almost equal, but this year's All England Music Awards seems to pay more attention to rewarding local excellent artists. Tinie Tempah and PlanB, both rappers, come from London. Tinie Tempah, 22, has just released his debut album Disc-Overy last year, and has won two awards of ""Most Breakthrough Artist in the UK"" and ""Best Single in the UK"". When receiving the award, he said that he would like to honor British music, which represents ""peace and love"". PlanB successfully transformed with the conceptual album ""The Defamation of StricklandBanks"", not only becoming the champion of the British Album Chart, but also winning the ""Best Male Artist in the UK"" this time. In terms of international awards, the Canadian rock band Arcade Fire was the biggest winner, winning two major awards, ""Best International Group"" and ""Best International Album"". Two days ago, they won the Grammy Award for ""Album of the Year"" with their new album ""Suburbs"". When publishing his statement, the lead singer, Wayne Butler, specially thanked the British band that had influenced them: ""From New Order to David Bowie, The Clash, Culture Club, Fashions and The Smiths. Thank you, England, very thank you!"" He also suggested that British audiences who are not familiar with them can search online. Roger Daltrey described the All England Music Awards ceremony as a carnival party, which was history. The ceremony was indeed just a self entertainment for the spectators. Instead of rows of seats, there were tables of feasts. Although the dinner table has not changed this time, the O2 Gymnasium is more like a performance venue rather than a banquet venue than the Earl Palace. This ceremony pays more attention to the performance effect, and the connection of the program is also more compact. The opening show of the Takeoff was perhaps the opening show with the most male actors at the All England Music Awards ceremony. A group of dancers dressed as anti riot police surrounded the five members, referring to the recent student protest in the UK. The hot dance is accompanied by the striptease of male dancers, which makes the audience laugh. PlanB presented a medley of new albums, which also included the special effect of being burnt by fire. Cee Lo Green, an American rapper who won the ""International Best Male Artist"", sang his hit single ""ForgetYou"" at the closing show, together with Paloma Faith, who was nominated for ""Best Female Artist in the UK"". On the previous Grammy Night, he just performed this song with Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow. There were also Arcade Fire, Mumford & Sons, Tinie Tempah, and Rihanna, the winner of ""International Best Female Artist"". Avril Lavigne and Adele, who were not nominated, also gave wonderful performances. Avril, Cheryl Cole and Diz Lasko also served as award guests. Linden/"

女儿卖房搬家照顾患病母亲【新民网·独家报道】自从老母亲因脑溢血倒下，54岁的蔡娅荣早出晚归照顾82岁的老母亲已经4年了。在外人眼中，蔡女士是个孝女。在自己眼中，她是为了弥补父亲脑溢血弥留之际自己未陪伴左右的遗憾。母亲节之际，当蔡女士接受新民网记者采访时，她连连自谦不值得采访，“我自己也是个母亲，这些都是应该做的。”4年前，蔡女士的母亲徐阿婆因突发脑溢血病倒，自那之后的2年，蔡女士往返于黄浦区和长宁区。“妈别人不认，虽然请了保姆，但还是只认我。我不来，她饭也不吃。为了照顾母亲，我几乎2年没回家。”2年前，蔡女士为了照顾方便，将黄浦区制造局路的房子卖掉，置换到了长宁区。蔡女士说，如今她只要花10分钟就可以往返其母亲家，每天则要在母亲家待上12个小时左右。蔡女士是家中长女，父亲在20年前因脑溢血过世，在那之前，蔡女士家的新生命诞生。蔡女士自述，因生养小孩，没在父亲床前多照顾，至今视为遗憾。4年前，当母亲徐阿婆也因脑溢血倒下，弟弟工作繁忙，蔡女士就挑起了照顾母亲的重任。徐阿婆因脑溢血而导致行动不便，根据医生说法，脑溢血病人很容易生褥疮，但徐阿婆却没有，可见照顾周到。时值今日，蔡女士仍在每天行使照料之职，而徐阿婆情况时好时坏，认不出人时，会叫蔡女士“姐姐”。接受采访时，蔡女士一直笑谈自己没什么特别，不值得采访。但这个普通的上海女人，却用平凡的力量，赢得了周围人的赞誉。(新民网记者萧君玮)	蔡娅荣,蔡女士,萧君玮,徐阿婆	正向	"The daughter sold her house and moved to take care of her sick mother [Xinmin News · Exclusive Report] Since the old mother fell down due to cerebral hemorrhage, Cai Yarong, 54, has been taking care of the 82 year old mother for four years. In the eyes of outsiders, Ms. Cai is a filial daughter. In my eyes, it is to make up for the regret that I did not stay with my father when he was dying of cerebral hemorrhage. On Mother's Day, when Ms. Cai was interviewed by Xinmin News, she repeatedly said that she was not worth interviewing, ""I am also a mother, and these are what I should do."" Four years ago, Ms. Cai's mother, Grandma Xu, fell down due to sudden cerebral hemorrhage, and for the next two years, Ms. Cai went back and forth between Huangpu District and Changning District. ""Mom doesn't recognize others. Although she has invited a nanny, she still only recognizes me. I didn't come, and she didn't eat either. In order to take care of my mother, I almost never went home for 2 years."" Two years ago, in order to take care of her convenience, Ms. Cai sold her house on Zhijuzhao Road in Huangpu District and moved to Changning District. Cai said that now she can travel to her mother's home in 10 minutes, and she has to stay at her mother's home for about 12 hours a day. Cai is the eldest daughter of the family. Her father died of cerebral hemorrhage 20 years ago. Before that, the new life of Cai's family was born. Cai said that because of giving birth to children, she didn't take care of her father more, which was regarded as a regret until now. Four years ago, when Mother Xu also fell down due to cerebral hemorrhage, her brother was busy with work, so Ms. Cai took on the task of taking care of her mother. Grandma Xu was disabled due to cerebral hemorrhage. According to doctors, cerebral hemorrhage patients are very easy to have bedsores, but Grandma Xu did not, which shows that she is well taken care of. Up to now, Ms. Cai is still exercising her duty of taking care of her mother every day, and Grandma Xu is in bad condition. When she can't recognize people, she will call Ms. Cai ""sister"". During the interview, Ms. Cai always joked that she was nothing special and unworthy of an interview. But this ordinary Shanghai woman has won praise from the people around her with ordinary power.

A man who absorbs more than 4000 members to make more than 2 million yuan was tried in Jiangmen yesterday. (Huang Qiong, a reporter from Xinguan (Huang Qiong, an intern from Maxuecan, a spokesman from Lin Jinsbiao and Li Xiang) used BT to download thousands of pornographic films to open an ""adult film network"", and then absorbed members from home and abroad through a special payment website to make more than 2 million yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the operator of the website, Huang, was accused of making a profit from duplicating and spreading pornographic materials, and was publicly tried in the court of Jiangmen City. According to the prosecution, the defendant Huang, who is a member of the Mainland, charged 190 yuan per month. In 2005, the defendant Huang wrote the ""girldv Adult Movie Network"" webpage program on his computer at his home in Pengjiang District, Jiangmen City, and purchased the website domain name from the ""www.namecheap.com"" website, and then rented a server on the Internet. Huang used the Bit Spirit download tool (BT) to download more than 1000 pornographic movies from the ""forum.fdzone.org"" website, then cut the above movie files into more than 3600 video files, and then uploaded them to the pornographic movie network he established for users to download at a cost. In order to make huge profits, Huang developed website members in the form of registered membership. Huang charged mainland members 190 yuan per month through Shenzhen NPS payment platform and members in Hongkong, Macao, Taiwan and abroad 30 dollars per month through ""VEROTEL"" payment platform. At the time of the case, Huang had developed 4354 Internet registered members (times), including 568 members who were still in use. The server is exempt from responsibility abroad. In court yesterday, Huang confessed to the charges. He said that he had engaged in the promotion of Shenzhen NPS payment platform before, and later found that adult movies were very profitable, so he decided to join them. After the establishment of the website, it did not particularly promote it. ""Most members found and joined on their own after searching on the Internet."" His defense lawyer said that the server of the website opened by Huang was rented in the United States, and this behavior did not need to be punished there, so he asked for a lighter or lesser punishment. In this regard, the prosecutor said that the relevant laws stipulated that the evaluation of this crime was measured in terms of the amount of illegal profits and the number of clicks, and the place where the members belonged was not the criterion to distinguish whether the situation was serious. The criminal act must be punished as long as it occurred in China."

女子昏迷中疑被男友砍掉手掌(组图)穿着黄色羽绒服的小文(化名)坐在哥哥(昆明)家中，两眼紧盯着茶几上的两张照片，照片是她和男友的合影。“看似一个老实人，没想到他这么凶残，居然把我的右手给砍掉了。”小文低沉的言语中透着愤怒。昨日中午，来自曲靖会泽的小文及其家人，跟记者讲述了小文的不幸遭遇。■讲述昏迷醒后右手不见了小文坐在沙发上，努力回忆着今年2月9日晚发生的事情。当晚8点到11点，男友几次打电话要求见小文，小文均表示“我还在上班”。深夜里，男友突然来到她宿舍，并强行把小文拉到1公里外的环西桥大观河观景台边。男友问：“过年了，一起回家行不行？”小文说：“年三十才放假，我要过了年才回去。”两人坐在观景台大石头上，没有吵架。沉默了许久后，大概在次日凌晨零点过点，小文说：“我要回住处了！”起身准备离开。但男友表示：“还没说好，你就要走！”紧接着，令小文意想不到的一幕出现了，对方一把将小文推下了1米多高的石坎，致使其后脑左侧撞在石头上，昏了过去。当小文醒来后，就看见警察和120医生在身旁。“当时，立马感到右手太痛了，在旁人提醒下我才发现自己的整个右手没了。”哥哥没找到妹妹的手小文哥哥说：“当天凌晨，我们是接到警方的电话才知道妹妹出事了。当我们赶到云南协和医院门口时已是凌晨1点半，全身是血的妹妹躺在急救车上睡着了，但伤口惨不忍睹。之后，妹妹被转到云南省第三人民医院医治，一直住到2月24日才出院。”看着妹妹的右手，哥哥非常伤心，“骨头都被砍碎了，当晚我就开着车来到环西桥观景台，开着车灯，和警察一起找了半个小时，现场只看到两大摊血渍，没有找到妹妹的右手。我们还猜测，他(妹妹男友)是不是把妹妹的手扔到河里去了或是带走了？从事情发生后，他的手机就打不通了，老家也没发现他的踪影。”小文哥哥说：“昆明市公安局西山分局东陆桥派出所民警于2月10日下午4点来医院，对妹妹进行了询问。上周，他到派出所询问案子的进展情况，警方答复还没发现嫌疑人踪迹，仍在查找中。”家人盼着警方尽快破案小文的家人说：“他既然做了事情，就应该面对现实，敢于承担自己所造成的后果和该负的责任，怎能一跑了之呢！”事情发生后，小文哥哥迅速将狠心男的照片进行复印，发到亲朋好友手中，请帮忙寻找。“希望警方能早日抓到凶手，将凶手绳之于法！”小文哥哥说。昨日，记者向西山公安分局东陆桥派出所电话询问此案，民警答复确有此事，但案件正在进一步调查之中。■回忆相亲媒婆牵线结识男友在小文及家人的讲述中，记者得知小文和男友是通过相亲认识的。在父母和哥哥眼中，小文是一个温柔的女孩。去年元宵节刚过，到了谈婚论嫁年龄的小文第一次表示愿意相亲。正月十六下午，媒婆就领着一名伙子来到她家。初次见面，小文和父母对话语不多的伙子有了第一印象：本分老实。随后，父母收了对方送来的酒、茶等薄礼，就算同意两人交往了。父母对女儿说：“你感觉好，就处处，我们完全随你的意思。”小文有点害羞，点了点头。从那以后，两人开始了恋爱。男方相当主动，频频打电话给小文。反感男友频频催着结婚去年2月，小文和男友来到昆明打工。男友给别人开车，小文则在一个餐厅做起了服务员。由于两人所住地点相距有点远，到休息日，经常都是男友来餐厅附近和小文见面。除了一起在外面吃点东西外，男友并没有多少话语。随着时间推移，可能是男友觉得是到谈婚论嫁的时候了，其父母便到小文家中商量结婚事宜，但小文父母仍然坚持要尊重女儿的意见。没想到，此后男友次次见面都提同样的问题，这让小文越来越反感。分手男友就是不同意去年8月的一天晚上，男友约小文见面并再一次催促结婚。这一次，小文想了又想，终于说：“我们两个不合适，还是分手吧！”男友沉默了片刻后说，“我不同意！我有什么毛病可以改的。”两个没有说到一块，当晚不欢而散。直到今年1月，就在小文不接电话和接触机会越来越少的情况下，男方仍然对小文说：“我们还是和好吧，继续相处下去！”并告诉小文，一起回家过年，过完年，把结婚的事办了，但被小文拒绝了。小文说：“继续相处下去，我不会开心，以后也不会幸福，还是分手吧。”听到这个答复，男友只是连连叹气。□首席记者吕世成(春城晚报)	吕世成,小文哥哥,小文	负向	"The girl was in a coma and suspected that her boyfriend had cut off her palm (picture) Xiao Wen (pseudonym), wearing a yellow down jacket, sat in her brother's (Kunming) home, staring at the two photos on the coffee table. The picture is a picture of her and her boyfriend. ""He seems to be an honest man. I didn't expect him to be so cruel. He actually cut off my right hand."" Xiao Wen's low voice was filled with anger. Yesterday中午, Xiao Wen and her family from Qujing Huize told the reporter about Xiao Wen's不幸experience. ▪ Tell me that after I wake up from a coma, my right hand is gone. Xiao Wen sat on the sofa and tried to recall what happened on the evening of February 9 this year. From 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. that night, my boyfriend called several times to see Xiao Wen, and Xiao Wen said ""I am still at work"". In the dead of night, the boyfriend suddenly came to her dormitory and forcibly pulled Xiao Wen to the Daguhe Observation Deck beside the Huanshixiao Bridge 1 kilometer away. The boyfriend asked: ""Can we go home together in the New Year's Day?"" Xiao Wen said: ""I will go back after the New Year's Eve holiday."". The two sat on the big rock of the viewing platform without quarreling. After a long silence, Xiao Wen said at about o'clock in the early morning of the next day: ""I want to go back to my accommodation!"" Get up and get ready to leave. But the boyfriend said: ""You are going to leave without saying anything!"" Immediately, an unexpected scene appeared. The other party pushed Xiao Wen down a stone bank of more than one meter high, causing her left occipital lobe to hit the stone and pass out. When Xiao Wen woke up, he saw the police and 120 doctors beside him. ""At that time, I immediately felt that my right hand was too painful. At the suggestion of others, I found that my whole right hand was gone."" Xiao Wen's brother said: ""In the early morning of that day, we received a call from the police to know that our sister had an accident. When we arrived at the gate of Yunnan Union Hospital at 1:30 a.m., our blood covered sister was sleeping in the ambulance, but the wound was too terrible to bear. Later, my sister was transferred to the Third People's Hospital of Yunnan Province for treatment until February 24."". Looking at his sister's right hand, his brother was very sad. ""The bones were chopped up. On the night, I drove to the Huanshiqu Bridge Scenic Spot. With the headlights on, I looked for half an hour with the police. The scene only saw two large blood stains, but I didn't find my sister's right hand. We also guessed that he (his sister's boyfriend) threw his sister's hand into the river or took it away? His mobile phone has been incommunicable since the incident, and his hometown has not found his whereabouts."" Xiao Wen's brother said: ""The police officers of Dongluqiao Police Station, West Mountain Branch of Kunming Public Security Bureau came to the hospital at 4:00 p.m. on February 10 to ask his sister questions. Last week, he went to the police station to ask about the progress of the case. The police replied that they had not found the suspect and were still looking for him."" Xiao Wen's family said: ""Since he has done something, he should face the reality, dare to bear the consequences and responsibilities caused by himself. How can he just run away!"" After the incident, Xiao Wen's brother quickly copied the photo of the cruel man and sent it to his relatives and friends for help. ""I hope the police can catch the murderer as soon as possible and bring the murderer to justice!"" Xiao Wen's brother said. Yesterday, the reporter asked the Dongluqiao Police Station of Xishan Public Security Branch about this case by telephone. The police replied that it was true, but the case is under further investigation. · Xiao Wen and his boyfriend got to know each other through matchmakers. According to Xiao Wen and his family, Xiao Wen and his boyfriend got to know each other through matchmaking. In the eyes of parents and brothers, Xiao Wen is a gentle girl. Just after the Lantern Festival last year, Xiao Wen, who had reached the age of marriage and marriage, expressed her willingness to match for the first time. On the afternoon of the 16th day of the first month, the matchmaker led a partner to her home. At the first meeting, Xiao Wen and her parents had the first impression of the partner who spoke little: honest and honest. Later, the parents received the wine, tea and other thin gifts from the other party, which means that they agree to communicate with each other. The parents said to their daughter: ""If you feel good, you can do it everywhere. We will completely follow your wishes."" Xiao Wen nodded shyly. Since then, the two have started dating. The man was quite proactive and frequently called Xiao Wen. I dislike my boyfriend's frequent urge to get married Last February, Xiao Wen and his boyfriend came to work in Kunming. The boyfriend drove for others, and Xiao Wen worked as a waiter in a restaurant. Because the places where the two live are a little far away, on weekends, it is often the boyfriend who comes to meet Xiao Wen near the restaurant. In addition to eating something together outside, the boyfriend didn't say much. As time goes by, it may be that the boyfriend feels that it is time to talk about marriage, so his parents come to Xiao Wen's home to discuss marriage matters, but Xiao Wen's parents still insist on respecting their daughter's opinions. Unexpectedly, the boyfriend mentioned the same question at each meeting afterwards, which made Xiao Wen more and more disgusted. The boyfriend didn't agree to break up last August. One evening, the boyfriend asked Xiao Wen to meet and urged him to get married again. This time, Xiao Wen thought again and again, and finally said: ""We are not suitable. Let's break up!"" The boyfriend was silent for a moment and said, ""I disagree! I can change what's wrong with me."" The two did not speak together, and broke up unhappily that night. Until January this year, when Xiao Wen did not answer the phone and the opportunity to contact was less and less, the man still said to Xiao Wen: ""Let's still get along well and continue to live on!"" And tell Xiao Wen to go home for the New Year and get married after the New Year, but Xiao Wen refused.

宝钛股份：最坏的时期已经过去新浪提示：本文属于研究报告栏目，仅为分析人士对一只股票的个人观点和看法，并非正式的新闻报道，新浪不保证其真实性和客观性，一切有关该股的有效信息，以沪深交易所的公告为准，敬请投资者注意风险。东方证券徐建花张镭杨宝峰中期业绩同比大幅下滑，股价已提前反映。上半年每股收益0.013元，同比下滑81.4%，主要原因是国内钛行业仍在底部复苏的缓慢进程中，公司产品销售结构仍无明显改善，产品销售仍集中在毛利率较低的民品市场。近期股价走势已充分预期了业绩大幅下滑的压力。6月份至今，公司股价大幅跑输大市30%，反映了行业自底部复苏的曲折反复以及中报业绩大幅下滑的预期。海外钛市场复苏强劲，预期下半年开始公司航空钛材出口订单逐步恢复。今年来波音公司一系列公告显示钛行业复苏强劲——如梦幻787试飞成功，预期年底交货及过去四个月连续三次公告对旗下多款机型未来两年生产提速。我们相信随着海外钛市场的持续复苏，公司航空钛材的出口回暖指日可待。十二五期间我国钛行业需求将进入全新爆发式增长领域，公司作为国内钛材行业龙头，将充分受益。“十二五”期间，我国航空航天、船舰和海洋石油开采、甚至医疗和体育休闲等国民经济部门对钛的需求都将迎来新的发展时期。中国的大飞机项目、嫦娥工程、航空母舰和新一代战斗机、海洋工程、核电站计划等都将逐渐迎来对钛材需求爆发式增长时期。公司作为国内钛材行业龙头，理当充分受益。上调至“买入”评级。按照10-12年海绵钛每吨6万、8万和10万的价格预测，经测算10-12年EPS分别为0.19元、0.69元和1.31元，我们维持盈利预测不变，评级上调至“买入”，目标价33元。理由主要有二：一估值优势。近期股价大幅下跌导致当前公司PB仅为2.4倍，在国内60多家有色上市公司中排名第三低，也处于公司历史估值低位区间，我们认为如此低的PB估值已经充分反映了行业低迷的预期。二公司航空钛材出口回暖指日可待，主要受益于海外航空业的强劲复苏。中长期12-18个月来看，我们认为一旦国内钛行业展开强劲复苏势头，参考国际钛业巨头TIE和RTI的PB运行路径，宝钛股份的PB也有望回到2008年上半年金融危机爆发前水平，即4倍左右。	张镭,徐建花,杨宝峰	正向	"Bao Titanium Shares: The worst period has passed. Sina Prompt: This article belongs to the research report column, which is only the personal opinion and view of analysts on a stock, not a formal news report. Sina does not guarantee its truthfulness and objectivity. All effective information about the stock is subject to the announcement of Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. Investors are expected to pay attention to risks. Fulin Securities Xu Jianhua Zhang Lei Yang Baofeng's medium-term performance has declined significantly, and the stock price has reflected it in advance. In the first half of the year, earnings per share were 0.013 yuan, down 81.4% year on year, mainly because the domestic titanium industry is still in the slow process of bottom recovery, the company's product sales structure has not been significantly improved, and product sales are still concentrated in the civilian market with low gross profit margin. The recent trend of stock price has fully expected the pressure of performance decline. Since June, the company's stock price has significantly underperformed the market by 30%, reflecting the tortuous and repeated recovery of the industry from the bottom and the expectation of a substantial decline in the performance of the mid term report. The overseas titanium market is recovering strongly, and it is expected that the company's export orders of aviation titanium materials will gradually recover in the second half of the year. A series of announcements from Boeing this year showed a strong recovery of the titanium industry - such as the successful test flight of Dream 787, the expected delivery at the end of the year and the continuous three announcements in the past four months to speed up the production of a number of models in the next two years. We believe that with the continuous recovery of the overseas titanium market, the company's export of aviation titanium materials will warm up in the near future. During the 12th Five Year Plan period, the demand for titanium industry in China will enter a new explosive growth field. As a leading domestic titanium industry, the company will fully benefit. During the ""Twelfth Five Year Plan"" period, the demand for titanium in the aerospace, shipbuilding, offshore oil exploration, and even medical and sports leisure sectors of the national economy in China will usher in a new development period. China's large aircraft project, Chang'e project, aircraft carrier, new generation fighter, marine engineering, nuclear power station program, etc. will gradually usher in a period of explosive growth in demand for titanium materials. As a leading domestic titanium industry, the company should fully benefit. Upgrade to ""Buy"" rating. According to the price forecast of 60000 tons, 80000 tons and 100000 tons of sponge titanium per ton from 10-12 years, the EPS of 10-12 years are 0.19 yuan, 0.69 yuan and 1.31 yuan respectively. We maintain our earnings forecast unchanged and upgrade our rating to ""Buy"" with a target price of 33 yuan. There are two main reasons: 1. Valuation advantage. The recent sharp decline in stock prices has led to the current PB of the company, which is only 2.4 times, the third lowest among more than 60 listed companies in the有色industry in China, and is also at the low level of the company's historical valuation. We believe that the low PB valuation has fully reflected the expectation of industry depression. 2. The company's aviation titanium materials are expected to warm up in the near future, mainly benefiting from the strong recovery of the overseas aviation industry. In the medium and long term (12-18 months), we believe that once the domestic titanium industry starts a strong recovery, referring to the PB operation path of TIE and RTI, the international titanium giants, the PB of Bao Titanium Shares is also expected to return to the level in the first half of 2008, that is, about 4 times."
时评话题：寒假作业批不批家长教师各有理21日，不少中小学生开始返校，上交寒假作业。一些家长反映，这些作业交上去，教师往往不作批改，这种“只做不批”现象是对孩子不负责。部分教师则认为，假期作业的本意是让孩子温习知识点，没必要全部批改。寒假作业是否应批改？家长、教师各有道理。家长：不批改如何知效果？“寒假作业也是正常的教学环节之一，老师有责任监控。”家长娄先生认为，寒假作业的作用，是让孩子温故知新，在假期玩乐中，别忘记“学习状态”。既然教师布置了作业，孩子完成情况怎么样，肯定要通过批改来进行监控，否则作业的作用不就落空了？家长钱先生认为，寒假作业老师不批改，可能会打击孩子的学习积极性。钱先生女儿从小就特别认真，寒假里，日记一篇不落，《寒假生活》一丝不苟。如今中小学学业评价中包括日常学习态度一项，若老师认真批改寒假作业，起码能看出孩子的学习态度。但老师不批，孩子的努力就无法得到肯定。有些贪玩的孩子缺乏自制力，需要家长天天盯着做作业。如果这些孩子知道老师并不重视寒假作业，甚至并不批改，那他们明年还会认真去完成寒假作业吗？这样岂不会形成“老师应付学生、学生应付老师”的恶性循环？家长伍先生还提出，批改作业既是对学生学习效果的了解，同时也是对老师教学的反馈。只有批改作业，才能发现哪些地方是难点，哪些问题全班普遍存在、需要调整教学。教师：孩子“自检”有助自主但有些教师认为，寒假作业全部批改，既无时间、又无必要，部分作业完全可以“自检”，教师有选择地批改寒假作业，并不影响反馈效果。某小学语文教师透露，今年刚过完春节就开学，备课时间十分紧张。她带的两个班里有70名同学，《寒假生活》、周记和读书笔记等若全部批改，至少需要两周，到时再反馈为时过晚。因此，常规办法只批改重要的作业，如读书笔记等，一本本仔细批改，并及时给学生反馈。“这样既有效率，又了解了寒假作业的效果评估和反馈。”“不少简单的、机械抄写的题目，教师不批改，并不影响反馈效果。”市实验性示范性高中的吕老师认为，《寒假生活》是为了让学生“温故知新”，正确答案已附在后面，孩子自己对一对，或者家长辅导一下即可。而且《寒假生活》过于简单，即使教师批改，也发现不了多少有价值的问题，不如“放权”让学生自查或互查，反而有助于培养其自觉性。也有教师认为，读书笔记、参观学习活动等，重在鼓励孩子静心读书或参与实践，无论读后感、实践报告水平高低，孩子在此体验过程中都会有所收获，何须教师检查、批改？	娄先生,吕,钱先生,伍先生	正向	"Commentary topic: Parents and teachers have their own reasons for not grading winter vacation homework. On the 21st, many primary and secondary school students began to return to school and hand in their winter vacation homework. Some parents反映that these homework are not often criticized by teachers, which is an ""unapproved"" phenomenon that is irresponsible to children. Some teachers believe that the purpose of holiday homework is to let children review knowledge points, and there is no need to correct all of them. Should winter vacation homework be corrected? Parents and teachers have their reasons. Parents: How can we know the effect without modification? ""Winter vacation homework is also one of the normal teaching links, and teachers have the responsibility to monitor."" Mr. Lou, a parent, believes that the function of winter vacation homework is to let children learn new things while having fun on holidays, and don't forget ""learning status"". Since the teacher has arranged homework, how can the child complete it without being corrected? Mr. Qian, a parent, believes that if teachers do not correct their winter vacation homework, it may discourage their children's learning enthusiasm. Mr. Qian's daughter has been very serious since childhood. In winter vacation, she wrote a diary and never missed it, and she was very careful with her winter vacation life. Nowadays, the evaluation of primary and secondary school students includes their daily learning attitude. If teachers carefully correct their winter vacation homework, they can at least see their learning attitude. But if the teacher doesn't approve, the child's efforts will not be affirmed. Some children who are greedy for play lack self-control and need parents to watch them do their homework every day. If these children know that the teacher does not pay attention to the winter vacation homework, or even does not criticize it, will they still take the winter vacation homework seriously next year? Will this not form a vicious cycle of ""teachers dealing with students and students dealing with teachers""? Mr. Wu, a parent, also proposed that correcting homework is not only an understanding of students' learning effect, but also a feedback on teachers' teaching. Only by correcting homework can we find out where the difficulties are and what problems exist in the whole class that need to be adjusted for teaching. Teachers: Children's ""self-examination"" helps to develop autonomy, but some teachers believe that it is neither time-consuming nor necessary to correct all the winter vacation homework. Some homework can be ""self-examined"", and teachers choose to correct the winter vacation homework, which does not affect the feedback effect. A primary school Chinese teacher revealed that the school started just after the Spring Festival this year, and the preparation time was very tight. She has 70 students in the two classes she brought. If the Winter Life, weekly journal and reading notes are all corrected, it will take at least two weeks, and it will be too late to give feedback at that time. Therefore, the routine way is only to correct important homework, such as reading notes, and give students feedback in time. ""This is both efficient and knows the effect evaluation and feedback of winter vacation homework."" ""Many simple and mechanical copying questions, teachers do not modify, do not affect the feedback effect."" Lu, a teacher of the experimental demonstration high school in the city, believes that Winter Life is intended to let students ""learn from the past and learn new things"", and the correct answer is attached at the back. Children can have a pair of them, or parents can tutor them. Moreover, Winter Life is too simple. Even if teachers make corrections, they can not find many valuable problems. It is better to ""delegate power"" to students to self-examine or examine each other, which will help to cultivate their consciousness. Some teachers also believe that reading notes, learning activities and other activities focus on encouraging children to read or participate in practice quietly. No matter how high or low the level of their feelings and practice reports, they will gain something in this experience process. There is no need for teachers to check and correct them?"

小伙为减压晚上化妆成女生出门称自己绝不变性傍晚时分，一名男子走进了太湖路的一家理发店。“老板，还和以前一样。”老板刘女士会意地点点头，拿出一瓶收敛水，仔细地往男子脸上抹，过了10分钟，刘女士开始清除男子脸上凝固的收敛水，为男子打粉底、涂腮红、画眉、粘睫毛，再仔细地涂上眼影、眼线、抹口红。男子拿出一个乌黑柔顺的假发套，让刘女士帮忙戴好，随后又钻进隔壁的小房间换衣服。20分钟后，一个长发飘飘，上身着红色短外套，下身穿黑色超短裙、黑色丝袜，脚踩黑色短靴，手挎粉红色包包的时尚“美眉”走出了理发店。李玉刚让他爱上“变装”的感觉男子名叫路成(化名)，25岁，合肥人。1月14日晚上，他以一身时尚的女装出现在合肥寒冷的街头。路成说：“我是特意去理发店弄的，他们专业的效果会好很多，平时我都是自己化，半个小时也能搞定。”路成“变装”缘起一次偶然的机会，他在电视上看到了身穿女装的李玉刚，感觉很“惊艳”，“太美了，我感觉很艺术。”那时路成正和前女友处在甜蜜期，趁女友不在，他会偷偷翻出女友的衣服和鞋子试穿，后来对女友的化妆品、包包也发生了兴趣。女友得知他的爱好后，并没有强烈制止，只是告诉他不要玩得太过火，所以他后来在女友面前也敢公开穿女装了，甚至在晚上化妆成女生，和女友一起出门逛街。“那时候都是偶尔穿下，纯粹是觉得女装好看，穿着觉得很好玩。”路成告诉记者。他说自己穿女装只是为了减压2007年，路成找到了现在这份在饭店的工作，开始了一个普通打工者的生活。然而长期劳累的工作加上单调的生活方式，让他渐感厌倦。寂寞和苦闷得不到宣泄，他只能靠上网来打发本就不多的闲暇时间。时间长了，路成在网上发现了一个特殊的群体，他们都是年轻男子，都喜欢白天男装，晚上则以女性形象示人。路成感觉找到了“组织”，后来他又在这个群体找到了现在的室友，两人成为了好朋友。现在，路成把合肥市有同类爱好的人加进了一个QQ群，自己担任群主，室友是管理员。“工作、生活、家庭的压力太大了，可能每个人减压的方式不一样，我们就通过穿女装的方式来排解压力，而且还可以展示自己的美，何乐而不为呢？”路成颇为自豪地告诉记者，自己身高168cm、体重104斤的身材走在街上很有“女人味”。14日晚上，记者和路成一同走进了多家饰品店、服装店，没有一位老板认出他是男儿身，一位老板甚至卖力地向他推销起女用化妆品。他的梦想是成为一名导游路成毕业于一所旅游学校，当导游一直是他的梦想。但毕业时，他的父亲刚好去世，而找一份导游的工作又并非易事，迫于现实的压力，他去了一家饭店工作。2008年下半年，他遇到了前女友，但后来还是分手了。“我准备明年辞职。”路成说，他想向导游的方向努力。现在的他正在努力攒钱，准备为以后打拼。而说起他心里完美的女孩，路成说没有特别的要求，“理解我，能过日子的就行。”他说自己是纯爷们绝不变性“我对自己的男性身份绝对认同，毫不犹豫地认同。”说起前段时间引起很多人关注的合肥“著姐”做变性手术的事，路成说可以理解他们想成为一名女性的心情，但不会跟风。路成说自己穿女装、化妆纯粹是为了好玩和减压，自己绝不会去做变性手术，在找到新女友之后，他会不再穿女装，“因为要考虑她的感受。”“男人就要承担自己的责任。”路成有两个哥哥、两个姐姐，都已经成家立业了。父亲去世后，家里就剩下60多岁的母亲。“每年过年我都会回去和我妈过，买年货、做年夜饭都是我的活。”心理专家：应有正确减压途径“这种减压方式目前还不被社会认同，时间长了很容易引起心理疾病。”针对像路成一样有“变装”爱好的群体，合肥新健康职业培训学校心理咨询师张建军告诉记者，每一个有独特爱好的人刚开始都是抱着猎奇的心理去尝试一些不为社会认同的行为，时间久了就会欲罢不能，而强大的社会排斥又让其时时感到压抑，如果这种压抑得不到正确的宣泄，往往会给当事人造成心理问题。“像路成这种已有两三年爱穿女装的经历，已经是异装癖的症状，是一种不正确的减压方式。”作者：甘琼芳郑蕊	李玉刚,刘女士,张建军,路成,甘琼芳,郑蕊	正向	"A young man dressed up as a girl at night to relieve stress, saying that he would never change his sex. At dusk, a man walked into a barber shop on Taihu Road. ""Boss, it's still the same as before."" Mrs. Liu nodded understandingly and took out a bottle of astringent water to carefully wipe it on the man's face. After 10 minutes, Mrs. Liu began to remove the solidified astringent water on the man's face, apply foundation, blusher, draw eyebrows, stick eyelashes, and then carefully apply eye shadow, eyeliner and lipstick. The man took out a black and smooth wig and let Mrs. Liu help him wear it. Then he went into the small room next door to change his clothes. Twenty minutes later, a fashionable ""beauty"" with long hair floating, wearing a red short coat on the upper body, a black super short skirt and black stockings on the lower body, black short boots on the feet and a pink bag in the hand, walked out of the barber shop. Li Yuge made him fall in love with the feeling of ""cross dressing"". The man's name is Lu Cheng (pseudonym), 25 years old, Hefei. On the cold streets of Hefei on the evening of January 14, he appeared in a fashionable women's dress. Lu Cheng said: ""I went to the barber shop on purpose. Their professional effect will be much better. Usually, I make up by myself, and I can also make up in half an hour."" Lu Cheng's ""cross dressing"" was due to an accidental opportunity. He saw Li Yuge wearing women's clothes on TV, which was very ""amazing"". ""It's so beautiful. I feel very artistic."" At that time, Lu Cheng was in a sweet period with his ex girlfriend. When his girlfriend was not around, he would secretly find his girlfriend's clothes and shoes to try on. Later, he also became interested in his girlfriend's cosmetics and bags. After his girlfriend knew his hobby, she did not stop him strongly, but just told him not to play too much, so he later dared to wear women's clothes in front of his girlfriend, and even make up as a girl at night to go shopping with his girlfriend. ""At that time, I just wore it occasionally. I just thought women's clothes were beautiful, and I thought it was fun to wear them."" Lu Cheng told the reporter. He said that he wore women's clothes just to relieve stress. In 2007, Lu Cheng found the job in the restaurant, and started the life of an ordinary worker. However, the long-term hard work and monotonous lifestyle made him gradually feel bored. Loneliness and bitterness could not be vented, so he had to pass the little leisure time by surfing the Internet. After a long time, Lu Cheng found a special group on the Internet. They were all young men who liked men's clothes in the day and women in the evening. Lu Cheng felt that he had found an ""organization"". Later, he found his current roommate in this group, and they became good friends. Now, Lu Cheng has added people in Hefei who have the same hobbies to a QQ group, where he serves as the group leader and his roommate is the administrator. ""The pressure of work, life and family is too great. Everyone may have different ways to relieve pressure. We can relieve pressure by wearing women's clothes, and we can also show our beauty. Why not?"" Lu Cheng proudly told the reporter that his figure of 168cm and 104 pounds was very ""womanish"" when walking on the street. On the evening of the 14th, the reporter and Lu Cheng went into many jewelry stores and clothing stores together. No boss recognized him as a son. One boss even sold women's cosmetics to him. His dream is to be a tour guide. Lu Cheng graduated from a tourism school. Being a tour guide has always been his dream. But when he graduated, his father died just in time, and it was not easy to find a job as a tour guide. Under the pressure of reality, he went to work in a restaurant. In the second half of 2008, he met his ex girlfriend, but later broke up. ""I'm going to resign next year."" Lu Cheng said that he wanted to make efforts in the direction of tour guide. Now, he is trying to save money for the future. Speaking of the perfect girl in his heart, Lu Cheng said there were no special requirements. ""Understand me, and I can live."" He said he was a pure man and would never change his sex. ""I fully identify with my male identity without hesitation."" Speaking of the fact that many people in Hefei paid attention to the ""Zhu Sister"" who had a sex change operation, Lu Cheng said that he could understand their desire to become a woman, but he would not follow the trend. Lu Cheng said that he wore women's clothes and make-up just for fun and stress relief, and he would never have sex change surgery. After finding a new girlfriend, he would stop wearing women's clothes, ""because I have to consider her feelings."" ""Men should take their responsibilities."" Lu Cheng has two brothers and two sisters, who have all got married and started their careers. After the death of his father, there was only his 60 year old mother at home. ""Every year, I will go back and spend the New Year with my mother. Buying New Year's goods and making New Year's Eve dinner are my jobs."" Psychological experts: There should be a correct way to relieve pressure ""This way of relieving pressure is not yet recognized by society, and it is easy to cause psychological problems after a long time."" Zhang Jianjun, a心理咨询therapist of Hefei New Health Vocational Training School, told the reporter that every person with unique hobbies began with the curiosity to try some behaviors that were not recognized by society. After a long time, they would be unable to stop, and the strong social exclusion would make them feel depressed. If this depression could not be released correctly, it would often cause psychological problems for the person concerned. ""Lu Cheng, who has had the experience of wearing women's clothes for two or three years, already has the symptoms of fetishism, which is an incorrect way to relieve pressure.""

奥尼尔斗志动摇退役倒计时鲨鱼一数据和乔丹并列新浪体育讯　整个夏天，奥尼尔都泡在了南佛罗里达，在迈阿密和奥兰多，有他的房产以及曼妙的沙滩———菲尼克斯的沙漠和燥热实在不讨“鲨鱼”喜欢。但是很快，沙克就可以自由地选择生活。在当地时间上周三，他在接受佛罗里达新闻13频道采访时列出了退役的时间表，也就是到2009-2010赛季结束。届时，他在昔日与热火签订的5年1亿美金合同履罄。沙克在说这番话时语调轻松，他在畅想两年后的快意生活：警察故事，说唱音乐，选餐时不再考虑卡路里……但是未来两年，对于沙克来说，将是被失败和老迈所包裹的两年，而对观者来说，看着这条搅动联盟格局近20年的“鲨鱼”一天一天老去，又难免会心生唏嘘。无欲所以归去13频道的主持人访问沙克时并没有想到会有这个收获，因为此前的奥尼尔从没有透露过退休计划———如果有，那也是他在吹牛，“我会打到40岁，像贾巴尔那样。”但事实上，他更像张伯伦，36岁的张伯伦，平均得分从一年前20.7分跌至14.8分，一年之后选择退役；39岁的贾巴尔季后赛尚有场均23.4分的贡献。在接受访问时，沙克异常轻松，言谈间似乎充满了对未来的憧憬，“为我倒计时吧，伙计，我的职业生涯还剩735天，然后我会做一个有教养的人。我(退役后)的选择之一就是从事法律实施方面工作，成为一名法律执行官员，最好是当一名警察。”对于沙克此番言论，太阳高层没有任何反应。官方网站上满是纳什、小斯的作秀以及希尔伤势、球票促销之类消息，惟独“漏”了沙克言退这条报道，当地《东谷论坛报》和《亚利桑那共和报》上，也没有总经理斯蒂夫·科尔惯有的高谈阔论。常理分析，沙克言退，即便在全联盟也是个大新闻，但是太阳有意无意选择回避，或许正说明他们内心的不安。年初不惜以当打之年的马里昂去换取老态已显的奥尼尔，被认为是太阳冲刺总冠军的一场豪赌。太阳最终季后赛第一轮就被马刺以4比1淘汰，随后主教练丹东尼东去纽约，意味这场豪赌几成败局。如今沙克早早列出了退役时间表，无疑又释放了一个消极信号———垂垂老矣且不想玩了的“鲨鱼”，已不可能再像以往那样成为砥柱中流。而对沙克本人来说，他对自己在太阳的前程也大抵看了个通透。明后年的他即便能保持上赛季的状态，但在竞争态势“一寸河山一寸血”的西部，太阳也很难为他带来第五枚冠军戒指，因为他身边的希尔、纳什，不比他小多少。当然，沙克也可能被交易———问题是谁愿意承受他2000多万美金的年薪？太阳也可考虑买断沙克———问题是这支球队的老板远没有尼克斯多兰那般阔绰。曾与乔丹争锋今年4月27日，马刺与太阳季后赛的第四战，后者主场经过一番苦战，赢得了这个系列赛惟一一场胜利。这场胜利对于太阳来说，只是关乎颜面，但是对于沙克来说，却是别有一番意义。凭借这场胜利，“鲨鱼”的季后赛胜场追平了乔丹的124场；迄今为止他的季后赛总得分达到5121分，是继贾巴尔和乔丹之后第三位季后赛得分超过5000的统治级球员。沙克并不仅仅在很多统计数据中把名字和乔丹并列，也是乔丹走上神坛(1991年夺冠)之后，第一个真正击败他的人。1994-1995赛季的季后赛，尽管魔术常规赛拿下东部最佳的57胜25负，但真正的主角只能是回归的乔丹以及他的公牛。首轮击败凯尔特人，奥尼尔等来了乔丹，“我终于有机会看看传说中的那个人有多么厉害。”双方在前四场战平。第五场“鲨鱼”在攻防两端继续控制比赛，23分并没什么稀奇，22个篮板中有14个前场篮板，则创造了季后赛常规时间最高值，另有5次封盖，其中两次送给乔丹。魔术赢得了“天王山之战”，并在随后一场解决战斗。自从1991年以来，乔丹只是输过这一次季后赛，若以趣谈，奥尼尔也算是惟一击败过“飞人”的超级中锋。如今，这个联盟惟一留存的超级中锋也在念叨着归去，尽管还有两年时间，但属于沙克的时代，已经无可逃遁般地结束。(航海）	沙克,张伯伦,希尔,贾巴尔,纳什,丹东尼,科尔,马里昂,奥尼尔,乔丹	正向	"O'Neal's fighting will shakes back to count down the retirement of the shark, a data and Jordan, Sina Sports News All summer, O'Neal soaked in South Florida, in Miami and Orlando, where he has his property and beautiful beaches - Phoenix's desert and heat really don't like ""sharks"". But soon, Shaq can freely choose his life. On Wednesday, local time, he listed the retirement schedule in an interview with Florida News Channel 13, that is, at the end of the 2009-2010 season. At that time, his five year $100000000 contract with the Heat in the past had been fulfilled. Shaq spoke in a relaxed tone, and he was looking forward to the happy life in two years: police stories, rap music, calorie consideration when choosing meals... But in the next two years, it will be a year of failure and old age for Shaq, and for the viewers, it is inevitable to sigh as they watch the ""shark"" that has stirred up the league pattern for nearly 20 years to grow old day by day. Desireless is the reason why the host of Channel 13, who visited Shaq, did not expect to have this harvest, because O'Neal had never revealed his retirement plan before - if he did, he was bragging, ""I will play until I am 40 years old, like Jabbar."" But in fact, he is more like Chamberlain, a 36 year old Chamberlain, whose average score fell from 20.7 points a year ago to 14.8 points, and he chose to retire a year later; Jabbar, 39, still has an average contribution of 23.4 points in the playoffs. When he was interviewed, Shaq was extremely relaxed, and his words seemed full of憧憬for the future. ""Count down for me, buddy. I have 735 days left in my career, and then I will be a cultivated person. One of my choices (after my retirement) is to work in law enforcement and become a law enforcement officer. It is best to be a policeman."" The Suns' top management had no reaction to Shaq's remarks. The official website is full of Nash, Xiao S's show and Hill's ticket promotion and other news, but it ""leaks"" the report that Shaq Yan withdraws, and the local East Valley Tribune and Arizona Republic do not have the usual high talk of General Manager Steve Kerr. In theory, Shaq's withdrawal is also big news in the entire league, but the Suns choose to avoid it intentionally or unintentionally, which may just show their inner uneasiness. At the beginning of this year, Marion, who was playing, was spared to get the old O'Neal, which was considered a gamble by the Suns to sprint for the championship. The Suns were eventually eliminated by the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs with a score of 4-1. Then coach D'Antoni went east to New York, which meant that this gamble was almost a defeat. Now that Shaq has listed his retirement schedule early, it has undoubtedly released another negative signal - the ""shark"" who is old and doesn't want to play anymore can no longer be a pillar of the river as before. And for Shaq himself, he has also seen through his future in the sun. Even if he can maintain last season's status in the next two years, it is hard for the Suns to bring him the fifth championship ring in the Western Conference, where the competition situation is ""an inch of river and an inch of blood"", because Hill and Nash beside him are not much younger than him. Of course, Shaq may also be traded - the question is who is willing to bear his salary of more than 20 million US dollars? The Suns can also consider breaking Shaq - the problem is that the owner of this team is far less rich than Dolan of the Knicks. On April 27 this year, the fourth battle of the Spurs and the Suns in the playoffs, the latter's home game won the only victory of this series after a hard fight. This victory is just about the face of the Suns, but it is meaningful to Shaq. With this victory, ""Shark's"" playoff victories were equal to Jordan's 124; So far, his total playoff score has reached 5121 points, the third top level player in the playoffs with a score of more than 5000 after Jabbar and Jordan. Shaq is not only parallel to Jordan in many statistics, but also the first one who really defeated him after Jordan went to the altar (winning the championship in 1991). In the playoffs of the 1994-1995 season, although the Magic won the best 57-25 losses in the East in the regular season, the real protagonist could only be Jordan, who returned, and his Bulls. In the first round, O'Neal waited for Jordan to defeat the Celtics, ""I finally have the chance to see how powerful the legendary man is."" Both sides drew in the first four games. In the fifth game, ""Shark"" continued to control the game at both ends of the attack and defense. 23 points was nothing special. 14 of the 22 rebounds were the highest value in the regular time of the playoffs, and there were another 5 blocks, including two for Jordan. The Magic won the ""Battle of King Mountain"" and then solved the battle. Since 1991, Jordan has only lost this playoff. If it is interesting to talk about, O'Neal is also the only super center who has defeated the ""flying man"". Now, the only super center remaining in the league is also talking about going back, although there are still two years, but the era that belongs to Shaq has ended in an inescapable way. (Sailing)"
领队：王奉春说了不合适的话“惩罚”并不少见3月5日，中国男子冰壶队队长王奉春出现在北京，和队员一起参加了国家体育总局为温哥华冬奥健儿举行的庆功表彰晚宴。在3月2日自温哥华返京当晚，王奉春曾被告知“暂时离队”，并于当晚便踏上了返回哈尔滨的火车。究竟是什么原因，让中国冰壶队的领队李东岩对王奉春做出了如此处罚？在皆大欢喜之际“调整队员”，李东岩到底出于什么样的目的？3月6日，本报记者就以上问题对李东岩进行了采访。李东岩谈王奉春“被调整”记者：想知道王奉春被调整的原因是什么？李东岩：王奉春被调整只是队伍正常的人员调整，希望这名队员能够回去冷静地思考。记者：是因为他在冬奥会赛场上表现不佳吗？李东岩：关于冬奥会的表现，我觉得没有什么问题，队员们都已经尽力了，男队第一次参加冬奥会比赛能够打到这样的成绩，展现出这样的水平和能力，我觉得没有问题。至于王奉春，他的确没有表现出最佳的水平，从第八场开始，我们用助理教练将王奉春换了下来。但王奉春被调整显然不是因为赛场上的表现。记者：那王奉春被调整的真正原因是什么？李东岩：还是情绪上的影响吧。最后两场他没有上场，心里不太高兴，在一些场合说了不太合适的话。比赛结束后几天内，他一直情绪很低落，大家住在一起，他的这种情绪会影响到其他队友。冰壶是一个集体项目，我们是为了赢球而来，不是要顾忌到哪个人的面子，作为队长，他更应该从全队出发。记者：回国那天让他直接回家，看起来有点残酷。李东岩：这件事也是赶上了，我们在温哥华就做出了决定：回国之后让王奉春先回家调整几天。当天回来的时间有点晚，到了首体就晚上7点20了，其实吃顿饭也没什么，但他的火车是9点钟开，我们肯定不能因为这一顿饭延误火车，就跟他谈了，由于事先不知情，王奉春有点接受不了。记者：那为什么又让王奉春参加了5日的庆功晚宴？李东岩：功是功、过是过。王奉春是中国男子冰壶队参加温哥华冬奥会的成员之一，既然庆功宴是为了表彰为冬奥会作出贡献的代表团成员而举办的，那么王奉春当然应该参加。记者：这是不是意味着他已经回队，并有可能参加即将开始的世锦赛？李东岩：主要还是看他自己的表现，他何时能重返国家队，完全取决于他自己的表现。“付出了那么多年，我真的不希望任何一个队员受罚。但严格管理，这可以说是我们队伍在七年间能够走到今天的一个重要原因，我觉得如果没有这种严格管理的话，队伍不可能具备如此的战斗力。”中国冰壶队领队李东岩如是说。对于王奉春与中国男子冰壶队，李东岩有着难以言说的感情，“比起女队，我对冰壶男队的时间和精力要付出的多得多。2007年他们没打进世锦赛后，如果我选择了放弃，而不是带着他们去比赛、训练，花很多时间放在他们身上，尤其是王奉春身上。他们根本不会走到今天，不会进入到冬奥会的舞台上。”李东岩说。此次对王奉春做出的调整决定，李东岩也很痛心，“作为队长，对王奉春的处理是不得已的，是对别人的一个交代。这是队伍管理的一个范畴”。七年艰辛“严”字当先2003年，中国冰壶队成立，从那一天起，李东岩就开始将自己的全部力量放在冰壶项目上，对于管理，他的态度是坚决的，从来没有因为哪一名队员是重点队员，或者关系的亲疏而有任何差异。借此机会让我们跟随李领队来了解一下冰壶队员的生活状态。首先是严格控制作息时间。李东岩介绍说，队里制定有详细的作息时间表，几点起床，几点出早操，几点吃饭，几点睡觉，都有具体的规定。其次是收电脑、手机。针对冰壶项目的特点，队员们需要有更多时间的交流与融合，中国冰壶队还采取了收电脑和手机的做法。“我们发现队员除了训练，回来之后天天‘捧’着电脑，这不是一件好事。因为有了电脑，大家可以‘打游戏’，看电影，但队员之间的交流就少了”。于是，队伍就制定了收电脑的政策，只在个别时间发给队员使用一段的时间。手机也是如此。从夏训开始，队伍就开始在晚上熄灯之前收缴手机，“一方面是保证大家不受外界影响，同时，也希望不要影响到其他队员的休息。”李东岩解释说。考虑到冰壶的项目特点，队伍在训练与平日的生活中也会根据队员不同的位置培养其责任感，“一垒做什么？二垒做什么？三垒、四垒分别做什么？替补做什么？大家都很明白自己的角色，职责分工”。看似苛刻的规定，队伍的每个人都欣然接受了。原因很简单，因为大家都知道对自己来说，最重要的是什么。“惩罚”事件并不少见李东岩说，王奉春被调整一事在冰壶队并不是首例，之前，这种类似于“惩罚”的事件也曾经发生过。“女孩子喜欢逛街，一到新地方，第一件事就想着逛街。我觉得这不是个很好的事儿，容易分散精力，转移视线。”李东岩说，后来他还真采取了“惩罚”措施，把姑娘们拉到一个超级大商场里，限定两个小时，随便逛，但是没有让任何人带钱包。2008年世锦赛前一个月，李东岩因为发现队里有人起到了不好的作用，临时调整人员，没有其余人员选择的李东岩本人报名，担任替补队员。“和欧洲和北美国家相比，我们的队员有些欠缺，就拿备战来说，其他选手会很明白自己在做什么，该做什么。但我们的队员显然并不了解，也不清楚自己该如何备战。队伍的管理者还需要去给他们留作业，真的有点累。”李东岩说。比队员年长十岁的李东岩并没有和队员打成一片，而是刻意营造了一种距离感，便于队伍管理。再加上从2005年学会了打冰壶，李东岩的训练水平并不差于任何一名队员，在队内比赛中曾赢过队员，对于周妍、岳清爽等队员，他都多多少少给出了一些指导性建议。“2008年世锦赛虽然没上场，但我参与了很多，我和队员们一起商量对策，想出了很多办法，最终拿到了第四名，我觉得非常的过瘾。”李东岩说。	李东岩,王奉春,岳清爽,周妍	正向	"Team leader: Wang Fengchun said something inappropriate ""punishment"" is not uncommon. On March 5, Wang Fengchun, captain of the Chinese men's curling team, appeared in Beijing and attended the celebration dinner hosted by the General Administration of Sports for the Vancouver Winter Olympic athletes with his teammates. On the night of March 2 when he returned to Beijing from Vancouver, Wang Fengchun was told to ""leave the team temporarily"", and then he embarked on the train back to Harbin. What is the reason for Li Dongyan, the leader of the Chinese curling team, to punish Wang Fengchun? When everyone is happy, what is Li Dongyan's purpose of ""adjusting players""? On March 6, the reporter of this newspaper interviewed Li Dongyan on the above questions. Li Dongyan talked about Wang Fengchun's ""adjustment"" reporter: I want to know why Wang Fengchun was adjusted? Li Dongyan: Wang Fengchun's adjustment is just a normal personnel adjustment of the team. I hope the player can go back to calm down and think. Reporter: Is it because of his bad performance in the Winter Olympic Games? Li Dongyan: As for the performance of the Winter Olympic Games, I don't think there is any problem. The players have done their best. The men's team can achieve such results and show such level and ability for the first time to participate in the Winter Olympic Games. I don't think there is any problem. As for Wang Fengchun, he did not show his best level. From the eighth game, we used the assistant coach to replace Wang Fengchun. But Wang Fengchun's adjustment is obviously not because of his performance on the court. Reporter: What is the real reason for Wang Fengchun's adjustment? Li Dongyan: It's still an emotional influence. He didn't play in the last two games, and he was not very happy. He said something inappropriate on some occasions. Within a few days after the game, he was always in low spirits. Everyone lived together, and his mood would affect other team members. Curling is a collective project. We are here to win, not to take care of anyone's face. As the captain, he should start from the whole team. Reporter: It seems a bit cruel to let him go home directly on the day he returned. Li Dongyan: This is also a coincidence. We made the decision in Vancouver that when we return, let Wang Fengchun go home to adjust for a few days. The time to come back that day was a bit late. It was 7:20 pm when we arrived at the first sports center. In fact, there was nothing wrong with having a meal, but his train was leaving at 9:00 pm. We must not delay the train because of this meal, so we talked with him. Because he was not aware of it in advance, Wang Fengchun could not accept it. Reporter: Why did Wang Fengchun also attend the celebration dinner on the 5th? Li Dongyan: Merit is merit and fault is fault. Wang Fengchun is one of the members of the Chinese men's curling team who participated in the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. Since the dinner party is to honor the delegation members who have made contributions to the Winter Olympic Games, Wang Fengchun should of course attend. Reporter: Does this mean that he has returned to the team and may participate in the World Championships that are about to start? Li Dongyan: It mainly depends on his own performance. When he can return to the national team depends entirely on his own performance. ""I really don't want any player to be punished after so many years of hard work. But strict management, I can say, is an important reason why our team can reach today in seven years. I don't think the team can have such combat effectiveness without strict management."" Li Dongyan, the leader of the Chinese curling team, said. Li Dongyan has an unspeakable feeling for Wang Fengchun and the Chinese men's curling team. ""Compared with the women's team, I have to pay much more time and energy to the men's curling team. After they did not make it to the World Championships in 2007, if I chose to give up instead of taking them to compete and train, and spending a lot of time on them, especially Wang Fengchun. They will never go today, never enter the stage of the Winter Olympic Games."" Li Dongyan said. Li Dongyan was also very distressed by the decision to adjust Wang Fengchun this time. ""As the captain, the treatment of Wang Fengchun is inevitable, and it is an explanation to others. This is a category of team management"". Seven years of hard work ""Strict"" is the first word. In 2003, the Chinese curling team was established. Since that day, Li Dongyan has put all his strength on the curling project. For management, his attitude is firm. He never has any difference because a player is a key player or the relationship is close or distant. This is an opportunity for us to follow the leader Li to learn about the living status of curling players. First, strictly control the time of work and rest. Li Dongyan introduced that the team has a detailed schedule, which specifies the time to get up, do morning exercises, have meals and go to bed. Secondly, receive computers and mobile phones. In view of the characteristics of the curling project, players need more time to communicate and integrate, and the Chinese curling team has also adopted the practice of receiving computers and mobile phones. ""We found that the players 'hold' computers every day after training, which is not a good thing. Because of the computer, everyone can 'play games' and watch movies, but the communication between team members is reduced"". As a result, the team formulated a policy of receiving computers, which was only given to players for a period of time at an individual time. Mobile phones are also the same. From the beginning of summer training, the team began to collect mobile phones before the lights went out in the evening. ""On the one hand, it is to ensure that everyone is not affected by the outside world, and at the same time, it is hoped that it will not affect the rest of other team members."" Li Dongyan explained. Considering the characteristics of the curling project, the team will also cultivate their sense of responsibility according to the different positions of the team members in training and daily life. ""What does the first base do? What does the second base do? What do the third base and the fourth base do respectively? What does the substitute do? Everyone knows their roles and responsibilities very well."". The seemingly harsh rules were gladly accepted by everyone on the team. The reason is very simple, because everyone knows what is the most important thing for them. ""Punishment"" is not uncommon. Li Dongyan said that Wang Fengchun's adjustment was not the first case in the curling team. Previously, this kind of ""punishment"" events also occurred. ""Girls like to go shopping. When they come to a new place, the first thing they think of is shopping. I don't think it's a good thing. It's easy to distract and shift your eyes."" Later, Li Dongyan really took ""punishment"" measures, took the girls to a super big shopping mall, limited two hours, and let them wander around, but no one was allowed to bring their wallet. One month before the 2008 World Championships, Li Dongyan temporarily adjusted personnel because he found that someone in the team played a bad role. Li Dongyan, with no other personnel to choose from, registered and served as a substitute. ""Compared with European and North American countries, our players are somewhat lacking. Take preparation as an example. Other players will know what they are doing and what they should do. But our players obviously do not understand, and they do not know how to prepare for the battle. The team leader still needs to leave homework for them, which is really a bit tiring."" Li Dongyan said. Li Dongyan, ten years older than the players, did not play with the players, but deliberately created a sense of distance, which is convenient for team management. In addition, since he learned to play curling in 2005, Li Dongyan's training level is no worse than that of any player. He has won the player in the team competition. For the players such as Zhou Yan and Yue Qingxuan, he has given some guiding suggestions. ""Although I didn't play in the 2008 World Championships, I participated in a lot of things. I discussed countermeasures with my teammates and came up with many ways to get the fourth place. I felt very enjoyable."" Li Dongyan said."
美股评论：诺基亚的赌注导读：2月11日，诺基亚正式宣布与微软达成全球战略合作伙伴关系，双方将会在智能手机领域进行深度合作。英国《金融时报》2月13日发表的社论就诺基亚与微软结成的战略联盟做出评论，认为诺基亚需要依靠微软的手机系统夺回被苹果和采用安卓系统的手机占领的市场份额。以下是该评论文章翻译：上周，诺基亚和微软宣布将在移动电话方面进行合作。商业联盟在历史上向来没有良好的表现，这可能是投资者对此项合作如此失望的原因。诺基亚希望利用微软的WindowsPhone系统与谷歌的安卓和苹果的iOS系统展开较量。诺基亚不是唯一面临战略问题的公司。虽然苹果的软件和硬件都有上升势头，但微软在个人电脑操作系统领域的支配地位从未被人夺走。然而，微软将其市场影响力向手机方面的转移并不成功。曾任微软高管、现为诺基亚CEO的史蒂芬-埃洛普(StephenElop)在上周两公司宣布合作之前称，诺基亚面临着一个“燃烧着的舞台”。他认为，诺基亚受到中国手机厂商生产的廉价手机和其他智能手机的夹击。诺基亚的困难不仅在此。即便在智能手机领域，诺基亚即将被淘汰的塞班平台也处于一个尴尬的境地，它被iOS和安卓包围。消费者并不像渴求iOS那样渴求塞班的系统，而塞班也缺乏安卓的开放源代码。埃洛普所依靠的是移动电话运营商，而这些机构则发现他们对自己所出售的手机的掌控受到苹果和安卓的挤压。他们想要看到第三家智能手机竞争者的出现，这样便可以与手机供货商就价格和手机的特点展开还价。从纸面上看，诺基亚和微软的战略合作的确有其意义。抛开其他问题不说，两家公司都拥有庞大的资源，且都已下定决心进行回击。诺基亚拒绝减少其研发资金的投入是导致其股价在上周五下跌的原因之一。但是问题是，在幻灯片上看似一致的东西却不能在现实中实现。大型公司之间难以合作的原因是各自有着自己的领域。诺基亚将更多的重心放在了此次合作之上，而微软将会把WindowPhone系统出售给其他手机制造商。航空业和汽车工业领域出现了许多合作，因为想要说服政府进行完全的收购是困难的。然而，相对于收购，企业间的合作仍旧不是首选之策，因为哪家公司控制什么、两家公司应如何合作是很难决断的。正如公司总裁所说，诺基亚希望此项合作会带来其预期的效果。诺基亚一定希望商业联盟的历史不会在他们身上重演。(多杰)	埃洛普,史蒂芬-埃洛普	正向	"US stock comment: Nokia's bet Introduction: On February 11, Nokia officially announced a global strategic partnership with Microsoft, and the two sides will cooperate in the field of smartphones. The Financial Times of the United Kingdom published an editorial on February 13 to comment on the strategic alliance between Nokia and Microsoft, saying that Nokia needs to rely on Microsoft's mobile phone system to regain the market share occupied by Apple and mobile phones with Android system. The following is a translation of the commentary: Last week, Nokia and Microsoft announced that they would cooperate in mobile phones. Business alliances have never performed well in history, which may be the reason why investors are so disappointed with this cooperation. Nokia hopes to compete with Google's Android and Apple's iOS with Microsoft's WindowsPhone system. Nokia is not the only company facing strategic problems. Although Apple's software and hardware are on the rise, Microsoft's dominance in the field of personal computer operating systems has never been taken away. However, Microsoft's shift of market influence to mobile phones was not successful. Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft executive and now Nokia's CEO, said that Nokia was facing a ""burning stage"" before the two companies announced their cooperation last week. He believes that Nokia is sandwiched between cheap mobile phones and other smart mobile phones produced by Chinese mobile phone manufacturers. Nokia's difficulties are not only in this respect. Even in the field of smart phones, Nokia's Symbian platform, which is about to be eliminated, is in an embarrassing position, surrounded by iOS and Android. Consumers do not crave the Symbian system like the iOS, and Symbian lacks the open source code of Android. Elop relies on mobile phone operators, but they find that their control over the mobile phones they sell is squeezed by Apple and Android. They want to see the emergence of a third smartphone competitor, so that they can bargain with mobile phone suppliers on prices and characteristics of mobile phones. On paper, Nokia and Microsoft's strategic cooperation does make sense. Regardless of other problems, both companies have huge resources and have made up their minds to fight back. One of the reasons for Nokia's share price to fall on Friday is its refusal to reduce its investment in research and development. But the problem is that what seems consistent on the slide cannot be realized in reality. The reason why it is difficult for large companies to cooperate with each other is that they have their own fields. Nokia focuses more on this cooperation, while Microsoft will sell the WindowPhone system to other mobile phone manufacturers. There are many cooperation in the aviation industry and the automobile industry because it is difficult to persuade the government to make a full acquisition. However, cooperation between enterprises is still not the first choice compared with acquisition, because it is difficult to decide what each company controls and how the two companies should cooperate. As the company president said, Nokia hopes that this cooperation will bring the expected results. Nokia must hope that the history of business alliances will not be repeated in them. (Dodge)"
大师大势解读：马竞顾杯赛恐失联赛国米主胜作胆1、博洛尼VS那不勒推荐10欧洲平均赔率：2.82-3.06-2.49。依据博洛尼亚的实力，打出最近不错的战绩，说明了球队的状态值得称赞，上轮客场4:3逆转热那亚后，球队已经脱离了降级区，但球队会状态不易保持。那不勒斯上轮即使主场2:2战平罗马，但球队最近的攻击乏力依然很明显，加之防守上始终不令人放心，如本轮能有效解决，客胜不是没有可能。亚盘开出的受让平/半盘，首选1，次选0。2、锡耶纳VS帕尔玛推荐31欧洲平均赔率：2.20-3.11-3.25。锡耶纳此前3轮2胜1平，保级的希望不是没有，从最近几轮主场的表现来看，他们还具备一定的战斗力。反观帕尔玛上轮一球拿下桑普后，结束联赛9轮不胜，即便如此，也不能掩盖后防不稳的毛病。亚盘开出的平/半盘中低水，水位有上升的趋势，映照出本轮平局的可能性很大，首选1，次选3。3、巴里VS切沃推荐31欧洲平均赔率：2.00-3.18-3.71。巴里经历赛季初的凶猛，最近几轮渐渐归于平淡，上轮更是4球负于卡塔尼亚，本轮主场对阵切沃，不容有失。切沃上轮2:1战胜卡利亚里后，球队取得两连胜，状态保持得不错，但受困于整体实力等因素，很难在巴里的主场有所作为。亚盘由初盘的半球高水到即时受注后的平/半盘低水，巴里有望迎来反弹。4、巴勒莫VS利沃诺推荐3欧洲平均赔率：1.50-3.75-6.79。上轮客场掀翻尤文后，巴勒莫目前位居联赛第四，本赛季的主场还未有失手加上边路进攻的体系日益成熟，让远道而来的利沃诺难有取胜的机会。利沃诺后卫莫罗、里瓦斯本轮停赛，后防残缺不全，加之客场作战，亚盘开出的一球盘中水，胜负没有悬念。5、亚特兰VS乌迪内推荐30欧洲平均赔率：2.29-3.10-3.09。老鹰的锋线在3:0大胜拉齐奥后，就陷入了沉寂，加之后防不稳，直接导致最近几轮成绩下滑，本轮面对最为直接的保级对手，不敢掉以轻心。乌鸡本赛季通过防反战术并取得一定的成效，但迪纳塔莱缺阵给本轮客场之旅蒙上了一层阴影。亚盘开出的平/半盘中高水，看好两队分出胜负。6、卡利亚VS卡塔尼推荐31欧洲平均赔率：1.98-3.18-3.81。上轮客场被切沃逆转，卡利亚里经历了两连败，球队排名有些下滑，但主场的卡利亚里此前10轮7胜3平的战绩堪称魔鬼，本轮迎战一向在客场打反击的卡塔尼亚，只要立足于防守，客队取胜的希望渺茫。亚盘开出的半球盘中高水，首选1，次选3。7、国米VS热那亚推荐3欧洲平均赔率：1.40-4.18-7.88。国米上轮3:2有惊无险拿下主场战绩不错的乌鸡后，与排名第二的米兰仅有4分之差，本轮坐拥主场，不会放过任何一个主场拿分的机会来巩固榜首位置。热那亚上轮主场被博洛尼亚逆转后，士气受到一定的影响，加之客场作战、排名稳居中游等因素给本轮作战的战意提出了疑问。亚盘由初盘的一球/球半盘中高水到即时受注后的一球盘低水，降盘降水，国米取胜不是什么问题。8、桑普多VS拉齐奥推荐3欧洲平均赔率：2.07-3.14-3.55。桑普上轮一球小负帕尔玛后，球队结束6轮不败，本轮迎战蓝鹰，桑普迫切需要3分来冲击前四位置，本轮前锋帕奇尼、波济回归球队，将大大增强球队的攻击实力。反观拉齐奥，上轮在行将完场让紫百合将比分扳平，到手的3分变成1分，现在球队已经在为保级而战。此番交手，亚盘开出的平/半盘中低水，认为桑普取胜无疑。9、毕尔巴VS瓦拉多推荐30欧洲平均赔率：1.73-3.46-4.66。毕尔巴鄂竞技的主场向来强悍，此前打出过4连胜的小高潮，这样的主场对苦于保级的瓦拉多利德来说，难以逾越。亚盘开出的半球盘低水，对主队甚是看好，但须防瓦拉多利德的触底反弹。10、马洛卡VS希洪推荐3欧洲平均赔率：1.73-3.44-4.64。马洛卡最近的状态起起伏伏，上轮艰难拿下瓦拉多利德后，勉强跻身联赛第五，本轮坐拥联赛战绩不错的主场(7轮6胜1负)迎战希洪，亚盘开出的半球盘超低水，看好马洛卡的主场优势。希洪上轮3:2拿下奥萨苏纳后，球队取得3轮不败，已经远离降级区，本轮客战，放弃的可能性比较大。11、马拉加VS萨雷斯推荐31欧洲平均赔率：1.61-3.57-5.51。马拉加近8轮联赛仅输给皇马、巴萨。可见球队在对阵弱队时的优势。萨雷斯本赛季降级的趋势明显，本赛季联赛客场无一胜绩的记录相信不会再马拉加身上打破。亚盘开出的半/一盘低水，不看好萨雷斯。12、萨拉戈VS马竞技推荐30欧洲平均赔率：2.54-3.23-2.62。萨拉戈萨重攻轻守，本轮后卫普利多停赛，无疑给本就不稳的后防雪上加霜，目前球队仅高出降级区4分，本轮对阵有欧战分心的马竞，亚盘开出的平手盘中低水，胜利的天平已向主队倾斜。马竞自弗洛雷斯上任后，球队表现出来的斗志与韧性，有目共睹，但联赛上半程欠债太多，联赛无望的他们已经将目标锁定在杯赛上，在成功淘汰加拉塔萨雷后，就更强化了这一目标，同时也给本轮的战意提出了疑问。13、奥萨苏VS赫塔菲推荐31欧洲平均赔率：2.15-3.22-3.26。奥萨苏纳上轮客场败走希洪后，球队已3轮不胜，联赛排名下滑得很厉害，整体状态不是很好。赫塔菲与奥萨苏纳有点难兄难弟的味道，同样联赛排名中游、都已有几轮不胜，此番交手亚盘开出的平/半盘中水，平局的可能性很大，首选1；如果临盘时稳定，次选3。14、西班牙人VS维拉利推荐10欧洲平均赔率：2.38-3.19-2.86。西班牙人凭借着主场最近5轮(4胜1平)的拿分，目前已经脱离降级区。维拉利尔在欧洲联赛出局后，将重心转向了联赛，上轮1球拿下拉科后，球队追求比较实用的打法来争取下赛季的欧战资格，本轮客战必然全力以赴，首选0，次选1。胜负彩第10020期：10-31-31-3-30-31-3-3-30-3-31-30-31-10(1024注)	里瓦斯,莫罗,迪纳塔莱,帕奇尼,普利多,弗洛雷斯,波济	正向	Master's interpretation of the trend: Atletico's fear of losing the league Inter Milan's main victory as a whole 1. Bologna VS Naples recommended 10 European average odds: 2.82-3.06-2.49. Based on Bologna's strength, the recent good results show that the team's status is worthy of praise. After the last round of 4:3 against Genoa away from home, the team has got out of the relegation area, but it is not easy to maintain its status. Napoli even played 2:2 at home last round, but the team's recent attack is still very obvious, coupled with the fact that the defense is always worrying, it is possible for the guest to win if it can be effectively solved in this round. The Asian plate opened a flat/half plate to let go, the first choice is 1, and the second choice is 0. 2. Siena VS Parme recommended 31 European average odds: 2.20-3.11-3.25. Siena has two wins and one draw in the previous three rounds, and there is hope of relegation. From the recent performance at home, they still have a certain fighting ability. On the contrary, Parme ended the nine rounds of the league without a win after scoring a goal in the last round, but it is impossible to cover up the instability of the defense. The Asian plate opened a low water level in the flat/half plate with a moderate water level, and the water level has a rising trend, which shows that the possibility of a draw in this round is very large. The first choice is 1 and the second choice is 3. 3. Barrie VS Chievo recommended 31 European average odds: 2.00-3.18-3.71. Barrie experienced a fierce season at the beginning of the season, and gradually returned to peace in the last few rounds. In the last round, he lost 4 balls to Catania. In this round, he played against Chievo at home, and he can't afford to lose. Chievo beat Cagliari 2:1 in the last round, and the team has won two consecutive games, and the team has maintained a good state, but it is hard to do anything in Barrie's home court due to factors such as overall strength. The Asian plate fell from the high water of the primary plate to the low water of the flat/half plate at the time of receiving the bet, and Barrie is expected to rebound. 4. Palermo VS Livorno recommended 3 European average odds: 1.50-3.75-6.79. After the last round of away games upset Juventus, Palermo is currently ranked fourth in the league. The home court has not lost its hand this season, and the sideline attack system is becoming increasingly mature, making it difficult for Livorno to come far to win. Livorno's defender Moro and Rivas were suspended this round, and the defense was incomplete, coupled with the fact that they were playing away, the Asian plate opened a moderate water level in the game, and there was no suspense about the victory. 5. Atlanta VS Udine recommended 30 European average odds: 2.29-3.10-3.09. The eagle's front line fell into silence after the 3:0 victory over Lazio, and the instability of the later defense directly led to the decline of the recent rounds. In this round, they faced the most direct relegation opponent, and they dare not be careless. The chicken has achieved some success this season by means of anti tactical, but Di Natala's absence has cast a shadow over this round's away trip. The Asian plate opened a high/medium water level in the flat/half plate, and it is expected that the two teams will win or lose. 6. Cagliari VS Catania recommended 31 European average odds: 1.98-3.18-3.81. Cagliari suffered two consecutive defeats after being reversed by Chievo in the last round away from home, and the team's ranking declined somewhat. However, Cagliari's 7-3-0 loss in the previous 10 rounds at home can be called a devil. In this round, they will face Catania, which has always played counterattack away from home. As long as they focus on defense, the guest team has little hope of winning. The Asian plate opened a high water level in the semi-ball plate, and the first choice was 1, and the second choice was 3. 7. Inter Milan VS Genoa recommended 3 European average odds: 1.40-4.18-7.88. Inter Milan had a 3:2 victory over the home team, which was a safe and good performance against the victorious Uchi in the last round. They only had 4 points with the second ranked Milan. In this round, they will have a home game, and they will not miss any opportunity to get points at home to consolidate their top position. Genoa lost to Bologna at home last round, which had some impact on morale. Coupled with the fact that they were away from home and ranked in the middle, this round's combat effectiveness was questioned. The Asian plate fell from the high water level in the first round of the one ball/basketball half plate to the low water level in the one ball plate after receiving the bet immediately, and the water level decreased. It was no problem for Inter Milan to win. 8. Sampdor VS Lazio recommended 3 European average odds: 2.07-3.14-3.55. Samp lost a small goal to Parma in the last round, and the team ended six rounds of invincibility. In this round, Samp urgently needs 3 points to challenge the top four positions. In this round, the forward Pachini and Pozzi returned to the team, which will greatly enhance the team's attack strength. On the contrary, Lazio let the Viola equalize the score in the last round, and the three points in hand turned into one point. Now the team is fighting for relegation. In this case, the Asian plate opened a low water level in the flat/half plate, and it is believed that Samp will win without doubt. 9. Bilbao VS Vallado recommended 30 European average odds: 1.73-3.46-4.66. The home court of Athletic Bilbao has always been strong, and it has played a small climax of four consecutive victories, which is hard for Valladolid, who is suffering from relegation. The Asian plate opened a low water level in the half ball plate, which is very promising for the main team, but it is necessary to prevent Valladolid from rebounding. 10. Mallorca VS Xijiong recommended 3 European average odds: 1.73-3.44-4.64. Mallorca's recent state has been ups and downs. After winning Valladolid hard in the last round, it barely ranked fifth in the league. In this round, it had a good home court performance (7-6-1) in the league to compete with Xijiong. The Asian plate opened a super low water level in the half ball plate, and it is expected that Mallorca will have a home advantage. Xijiong won Osasuna 3-2 in the last round. The team has won three rounds without defeat, and has moved away from the relegation area. In this round, it is likely to give up the guest fight. 11. Malaga VS Zarz recommended 31 European average odds: 1.61-3.57-5.51. Malaga has lost only to Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past eight rounds of the league, which shows the team's advantage against weak teams. Zarz has an obvious trend of relegation this season. It is believed that the record of no victory in the league away from home this season will not be broken in Malaga. The Asian plate opened a low water level in the half/one plate, and it was not optimistic about Zarz. 12. Sarago VS Ma Jing recommended 30 European average odds: 2.54-3.23-2.62. Saragoza focuses on attack rather than defense. In this round, the suspension of defender Prado undoubtedly adds to the instability of the already unstable later defense. At present, the team is only 4 points higher than the relegation area. In this round, it played against Ma Jing, who was distracted by the European War. The Asian plate opened a low water level in the even handed plate, and the balance of victory has tilted to the main team. Ma Jing has shown the fighting spirit and toughness of the team since Flores took office, which is obvious to all, but the league owes too much in the first half of the season, and they have locked the target on the cup after the successful elimination of Galatasaray, which also raises questions about the combat effectiveness of this round. 13. Osassu VS Getafe recommended 31 European average odds: 2.15-3.22-3.26. After Osasuna lost away from home in the last round, the team has not won three rounds, and the league ranking has dropped a lot, and the overall state is not good. Getafe has a hard brother with Osasuna. Similarly, the league ranking is in the middle and there have been several rounds of no win. This battle, the Asian plate opened a moderate water level in the flat/half plate, and there is a great possibility of a tie. The first choice is 1; If the disk is stable at the time of the disk, the second choice is 3. 14. Spaniard VS Villar recommended 10 European average odds: 2.38-3.19-2.86. The
男子捡到警察手机发诈骗短信被抓获晨报讯捡到他人手机后，竟然动起了歪脑筋，企图通过短信诈骗对方亲友7万多元。然而，朱某怎么也没想到，自己捡到的手机竟原本属于嘉定一名刑警。当他将30条诈骗短信发给“电话簿”上的联系人时，大部分短信实际上传给了嘉定公安的民警。昨天，记者从嘉定警方获悉，朱某诈骗一分未得，便被抓获。“我是许林（化名），我现在外地出了点事，请速汇2000元至农行95599×××××（账号），开户人姓名杨武军。”今年春节期间，嘉定公安局刑侦支队民警许林的同事陆续收到一个陌生号码发来的相同短信。“许林当天还在单位加班，怎么一下子到了外地？”同事感觉事有蹊跷，纷纷打电话询问许林，最终证实许林并未发过这则短信。然而，令许林纳闷的是，发短信的人为什么会知道他的真实姓名，并会有那么多同事的联系方式？经过仔细回忆，许林想起去年6月乘坐出租车时，自己曾遗失过一部手机，他马上办理了手机补卡手续，而这次收到短信的30名亲友均为原来手机“电话簿”上的联系人。“这很可能是一起短信诈骗案！”出于职业敏感，许林立即电话通知所有可能收到短信的亲友同事不要上当，同时投入到案件侦查工作中。经调查，许林发现银行开户人杨武军的身份是虚构的。与此同时，民警通过银行监控系统发现，有一名男子每天都要到嘉定塔城路一银行ATM机上查询账户信息。2月6日下午，经过跟踪守候，许林和同事最终在塔城路一家医院门口将这名男子抓获，当场缴获了许林曾经丢失的手机。经审讯，犯罪嫌疑人朱某交代了自己利用许林遗失的手机，企图通过短信诈骗7万多元的犯罪事实。目前，朱某已被刑事拘留。（记者倪冬实习生孔文）	许林,杨武军,孔文,倪冬,朱某	负向	"A man who picked up a police mobile phone and sent a fraudulent text message was caught by the Morning News. When he found someone else's mobile phone, he had a crooked idea and tried to defraud his relatives and friends of more than 70000 yuan through a text message. However, Zhu never expected that the mobile phone he found actually belonged to a criminal police officer in Jiading. When he sent 30 fraudulent text messages to the contacts on the ""address book"", most of the messages were actually sent to the police officers of Jiading Public Security. Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Jiading police that Zhu had not received any money from the fraud and was caught. ""I am Xu Lin (pseudonym). I have something wrong in another place now. Please remit 2000 yuan to Agricultural Bank 95599 × × × × × (account), and the name of the account holder is Yang Wujun."" During this year's Spring Festival, Xu Lin's colleagues from the Criminal Investigation Detachment of Jiading Public Security Bureau received the same text message from an unfamiliar number one after another. ""Xu Lin is still working overtime at the unit today. How can he suddenly go to another place?"" The colleagues felt that there was something wrong, so they called Xu Lin to ask, and finally confirmed that Xu Lin did not send the text message. However, what puzzled Xu Lin was why the person who sent the text message knew his real name and had so many colleagues' contact information? After careful回忆, Xu Lin remembered that when he took a taxi in June last year, he lost his mobile phone. He immediately handled the mobile phone replenishment card procedure, and the 30 relatives and friends who received the text message this time were the contacts on the ""address book"" of the original mobile phone. ""This is likely to be a case of SMS fraud!"" Due to professional sensitivity, Xu Lin immediately telephoned all the relatives and colleagues who may receive the text message not to be cheated, and at the same time, he devoted himself to the investigation of the case. After investigation, Xu Lin found that the identity of Yang Wujun, the bank account holder, was fictitious. At the same time, the police found through the bank monitoring system that a man had to go to an ATM on塔城Road, Jiading, to check his account information every day. On the afternoon of February 6, after tracking and waiting, Xu Lin and his colleagues finally caught the man at the gate of a hospital on Taccheng Road and seized the mobile phone that Xu Lin had lost. After interrogation, the criminal suspect Zhu Jiajia confessed that he had lost Xu Lin's mobile phone and attempted to commit a crime of more than 70000 yuan through a text message. At present, Zhu has been criminally detained. (Reporter Ni Dong, intern Kong Wen)"

He was met by Zhou Xin, a household police officer of Dunren Police Station. Zhou Xin caught the criminal with his bare hands. After being stabbed by the criminal, he covered his chest and chased the criminal for 44 meters before he fell down and sacrificed. Hero's resume Zhou Xin, born on January 6, 1979, participated in public security work in August 1999, joined the Party in 2002, and has a bachelor's degree and a first-level police officer. ■ Victims: The gangster stabbed four people in the street. At 8:00 pm on the 20th, Kuang Ling Song, the boss of the No. 46 lottery betting station on West People's Road, Fuling District, was just closing his home. A young man jumped down from the stairs and pressed his shoulder. Kuang felt a stab in his left thigh. Before he could react, the man had escaped. Kuang took off his trousers and found a 1.5cm long knife wound on his left leg. ""Call the police quickly! This child has killed two people."" The crowd shouted to Kuang. The clinic at No. 16, West People's Road, which treats three victims, said that the first victim, Mr. Wen, who is about 40 years old, was stabbed beside the Second Clinic of Fuling District People's Hospital; The second victim, Mr. Zeng, was wounded in front of a tobacco specialty store on West People's Road; The injured parts of Wen and Zeng were all thighs, with wounds 1.5cm long and 1.5cm deep. The reporter learned that the three victims were stabbed in less than 5 minutes. After debridement and bandaging, three people were not seriously injured. The Public Security Bureau announced yesterday that the criminal had also stabbed another pedestrian on the street. ■ Witness: The wounded police officer chased the criminal for 44 meters. Ms. Zhong, a witness, introduced that after the criminal stabbed Kuang Ling Song, he waved his knife and escaped south along West People's Road. The crowd shouted: ""Murder, catch him."" When the criminal ran to the vicinity of Dunren Police Station, a thin young man in plain clothes shouted: ""Stop! I'm a policeman!"" He tried to catch the criminal with his bare hands. The criminal broke away and held the knife to stab the thin youth randomly. After more than 10 seconds of fighting, the thin young man covered his chest and abdomen, shouting ""catch him"" while closely following the criminal. Ms. Zhong said that after 44 meters of chasing, the thin young man fell to the ground and never got up again. The police in uniform came to help the thin young man and shouted: ""Call an ambulance quickly. He is Zhou Xin, a police officer of our Dunren Office."" Zhong then learned that the thin man was Zhou Xin, a household police officer of Dunren Police Station. At about 8:00 p.m., when Zhou Xin was working overtime, he went out of the police station to eat, just when the crowd was shouting to catch the criminal. The police and the crowd sent Zhou Xin to the hospital for treatment. Due to serious injuries and excessive bleeding, Zhou Xin died heroically but ineffectively. The doctors of Fuling District Emergency Rescue Center who participated in the rescue said that if Zhou Xin did not continue to pursue after being injured, he might not lose so much blood, and there would be more hope of rescue. ■ Pursuit and capture: The suspect was captured 40 minutes later. After the case, the Fuling police quickly mobilized their forces to set up a network. At 8:40 p. m. that night, the police caught him at the home of the suspect Shaofanjie in the oil company's dormitory on Song Cui Road. The police searched a knife from Shaofanjie's home. Through monitoring comparison, it was preliminarily confirmed that the knife was the weapon that killed five people, including the police. According to the investigation, Shaofanjie, 18 years old, jobless, is a drug abuser. He has been investigated by the police twice, and the motive for this crime remains to be further examined. The news that Zhou Xin died when he caught the criminal soon spread throughout Fuling City. From 9:00 a.m. yesterday to 7:00 p.m., more than 1000 citizens spontaneously went to Fuling Funeral Home to mourn. The hero's first class merit will also apply for martyrs and first class hero models. In the early morning of yesterday, on behalf of Wang Lijun, the party secretary of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Wang Huagang, Yang Zengyu and Wang Tingyan, leaders of the Public Security Bureau, rushed to Fuling District to visit and comfort Zhou Xin's relatives. At about 3:00 p. m. yesterday, Wang Lijun flew to Fuling to visit and comfort Zhou Xin's relatives. Wang Lijun gave clear instructions on the rehabilitation work: ""We must not let the heroes bleed and cry."" At about 4:00 p. m. yesterday, the Public Security Bureau reported to the media that it would posthumously award Zhou Xin the first prize. The Fuling District Government said that it was actively preparing materials for Zhou Xin to apply for revolutionary martyrs. The Public Security Bureau also said that it would apply to the Ministry of Public Security for Zhou Xin to be a first-class model. It is understood that the unit has insured Zhou Xin with Ping An Insurance Company for work-related accident insurance. Yesterday morning, Zhong Jian, the general manager of Fuling Center of the insurance company, said that the 200000 yuan work-related accident insurance will be transferred to the beneficiary's account of Zhou Xin in two days. The grandmother of the suspect: dropout on the second day of junior high school and混迹society have injured others many times. Yesterday morning, the reporter found Grandma Zhang, the grandmother of Shao Jie. She said that she did not know her grandson was taking drugs. After Shao Jie's parents divorced, they neglected to take care of him. Shao started to mix in society since junior high school. Yesterday afternoon, Shao Jie came to her house from his residence on Song Cui Road. When leaving, she took Shao to the楼下and watched him get in the car. Grandma Zhang explained that this was because Shao Jie had an illusion. When he saw someone talking on the phone for a long time or shouting loudly on the street, he thought it was scolding him, and he would hurt others. Shao Jie has had a tendency of violence since last year. Grandma Zhang said that more than four or five people who had been stabbed with a small knife by him earlier had not yet been paid for their damages to a surnamed Deng last year. Because Shao Jie's parents could not contact him, his grandparents also moved away from their original residence. As of 6:00 p. m. yesterday, the reporter could not find other relatives of Shao Jie. In memory of the parents of the hero: ""I'm proud of you and proud of you"" In the sound of funeral music, in front of the coffin, Zhou Xin's father held back his tears to greet the guests. He said that his son chose to be a people's policeman and must always be prepared to sacrifice. Zhou's father works in Qingxi Town Police Station, and his mother works in Jiaoshi Clinic. They have lived in two places for a long time, and Zhou Xin did not get good care when he was a child. Now that I'm going to retire, my son is gone... Zhou's mother also chose to be strong when her son left. She said: ""Son, I will not cry, I will be proud of you and proud of you, I can't cry."" But Mother Zhou cried again, and her eyes swelled. Colleagues: ""Live up to the police uniform"" Feng Wenbo, Zhou Xin's colleague, said that Grandma Wu, a resident in the jurisdiction, was a widow who was more than 90 years old. It was very difficult to communicate with her, but Zhou Xin went to Grandma Wu's home every week to have a chat. Grandma Wu praised ""Zhou's household registration"" when she saw people. Feng Wenbo said that Zhou Xin didn't talk much in the office, but he was very talkative when receiving public inquiries or assistance, and even he was tireless. Now recalling, he was practicing a sentence he had said - ""Doing things must live up to the police uniform."" Wife: ""I'm still waiting for you to have dinner"" The wife of the hero, Jia Zhengmin, has mumbled. She cried to the reporter about how she knew and loved her husband and the process they experienced together. She said that last August, the crystallization of their love, their daughter, came, and the family began a sweet life of three mouths. ""How can I explain to the children? Didn't you say you want to teach her to sing Dad well?"" Jia Zhengmin sobbed again. On the morning of the incident, Zhou Xin left home at more than 7:00, saying that there were many things to do in the police station that day. At more than 7:00 p. m., he also talked with Jia Zhengmin on the phone, saying that the data had not been sorted out yet, and let her wait until later when she came back for dinner. She also said: ""It's weekend, wait a while! Come back early."" But this wait was a call from the nurse. Jia Zhengmin flew to the hospital, and her lover had his eyes closed. ""I'm still waiting for you to have dinner..."" Jia Zhengmin cried again. This edition of the newspaper was written by Xia Xiangzhou, a reporter"

智富能源折让八成配股股价疯狂炒高逾两成新浪财经讯智富能源(1051)昨日宣布配股集资46亿港元，承诺参与配股的投资者，包括周大福集团的郑裕彤、黑石基金(BlackRock)、摩根大通及富兰克林等机构。虽然配股价较前日收市价折让达八成，但智富股价昨日仍被疯狂炒高逾两成。智富能源昨日公布，计划透过摩根士丹利配售超过130亿股新股，配股价为0.35元较智富前日收市价折让79%。并已获得上述投资者的承诺，将作为基础投资者认购全部新股，涉资约46亿元。而且此次配股无禁售限制，只要在两周后的股东大会上配股建议获得通过，各大巨头所持股价已可实时账面获利达6倍。智富昨日在大涨两成后，收市报2元。据《明报》报道，智富能源主席刘梦熊表示：“我们只找最顶级的投资伙伴，拍档一齐打天下。”他还事先张扬称，在本月22日的特别股东大会之前，仍会继续寻找本地财团以及国际金融机构入股，以求“有钱大家赚。”智富能源之所以引得各大巨头加入，皆因早前高调宣布，成功收购了一个印度尼西亚金矿。刘梦熊昨日形容，这个本由澳洲矿业大王OZMinerals拥有的金矿占地达1600平方公里，现时仅勘探了其中的30平方公里，即已探明大量黄金矿藏，故此当OZ放售时，多路财团亦争相抢购，但是最终落到智富的手上，“这个矿可是世界知名，周大福是大金商，他们入股亦是深知这个矿是好的。”将收购老挝柬埔寨金矿刘梦熊还透露，这次透过配股集资的约6亿美元中，其中2.2亿美元将用作收购有关金矿的代价，同时亦会投入约2亿美元作基本建设，“本来OZ已投资了7500万美元，加上我们这笔投入，预期明年年底左右就可以投产了。”至于余下的约1.8亿美元资金，刘梦熊亦有打算，“趁OZ要钱，我们将陆续收购他在老挝、柬埔寨等地的金矿。”	刘梦熊,郑裕彤	正向	"Wisdom Energy discounts 80% of the shares for crazy trading up more than 20% Sina Finance News Wisdom Energy (1051) announced yesterday that it would raise HK $4.6 billion through a share offering, including Zheng Yutong of Chow Tai Fook Group, BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, Franklin and other institutions, which have promised to participate in the share offering. Although the share price was discounted by 80% from the closing price of the day before yesterday, the share price of Zhifu was still crazy yesterday, more than 20%. Wisdom Energy announced yesterday that it plans to sell more than 1.3 billion new shares through Morgan Stanley, with a share price of 0.35 yuan, which is 79% lower than the closing price of Wisdom on the day before yesterday. And has obtained the commitment of the above investors to subscribe all new shares as basic investors, involving funds of about 4.6 billion yuan. Moreover, this share offering is not subject to any prohibition on sale. If the share offering proposal is approved at the shareholders' meeting in two weeks, the share prices held by the giants can be realized at a profit of up to 6 times. After rising by 20% yesterday, Wisdom closed at 2 yuan. According to the Ming newspaper, Liu Mengxiong, chairman of Wisdom Energy, said: ""We only look for the best investment partners and partners to fight the world together."" He also publicized in advance that he would continue to look for local consortia and international financial institutions to join the stock until the special shareholders' meeting on the 22nd of this month, in order to ""make money for everyone."" The reason why Wisdom Energy has attracted major giants to join is that it has earlier announced that it has successfully acquired an Indonesian gold mine. Liu Mengxiong described yesterday that the gold mine, originally owned by the Australian mining giant OZMinerals, covers an area of 1600 square kilometers. At present, only 30 square kilometers has been explored, that is, a large number of gold deposits have been found. Therefore, when OZ put it on the market, many financial consortia also competed to purchase it. However, it finally fell into the hands of Wisdom. ""This mine is world famous. Chow Tai Fook is a major gold merchant. They also know that this mine is good when they invest in it."" Liu Mengxiong also revealed that he would acquire the gold mines of Laos and Cambodia. Liu Mengxiong also revealed that this acquisition will be used for the acquisition of the gold mine through the share offering of about US $600 million, in which US $220 million will be used as the price of the gold mine, and US $200 million will also be invested in infrastructure construction. ""OZ has already invested US $75 million, and our investment is expected to start production around the end of next year."" As for the remaining US $1.8 billion, Liu Mengxiong also has plans, ""Take advantage of the fact that OZ wants money, we will continue to acquire his gold mines in Laos, Cambodia and other places."""

The 2011 World Cup Waterskiing China - Linyi Station ended in Yiheshui, Linyi City, Shandong Province. The world-class experts' high-level competition in the tail wave and jumping four events made the audience shout for fun. Chen Lily won the bronze medal in the women's tail wave event. The women's tail wave event was the only event in which Chinese players entered. Chen Li Li was the second to play in the game. Her action in the first half was very smooth and the difficulty was also quite high. Unfortunately, the mistake of the last difficult action in the second half fell into the water, which made her only get 55.34 points and win the bronze medal of the event. Duan Zhenkun, another young Chinese player who participated in the competition, fell into the water twice in the competition, and did not play well enough. He only scored 43.01 points, ranking at the bottom of the six players who participated in the final.

Harry Clifford, an 18 year old Australian genius who was promoted to the semi final of the men's tail wave project with an ultra high score of 92.77, performed perfectly in the first half of the competition. His action difficulty, take-off height and action completion quality were like textbook standards. Unfortunately, he fell in the last difficult action in the second half. Fortunately, the timing of his falling in the water was before the 3/4 buoy, so he still had the opportunity to play in the extra game. When he challenged an ultra high difficulty in the extra game, he unfortunately fell into the water again, but he still won the championship with a score of 88.57. Although the American player Andrew Adkins scored higher than Harry in the action completion, the gap in the difficulty of the action still made him lose the runner-up by less than 3 points. Daniel Powell, another player from the United States, had a big gap with the two people, and won the bronze medal with 70.12 points. The women's jumping event achieved good results. Natalia Bordnikova, who was ranked first in the semi final and came from Belarus, won the championship with an uncontroversial score of 52.1 meters.

山寨网站骗术多双节出行如何防骗打假随着双节的临近，机票的预订日趋火爆，特价机票销售更是一票难求。随着人们对互联网的运用越来越多，利用特价机票来吸引顾客眼球的虚假网站也越来越多。由于互联网进入门槛较低，模仿成本也很低，导致目前机票预订市场上山寨横行，甚至一些虚假网站直接利用特价机票进行诈骗行为。中国消费者协会依据中文在线旅行网站“去哪儿网”(Qunar.com)今年6-8月全网(调查对象包含所有参与过在线旅行预订的消费者，调查方式包含：网络调查问卷、电话访问、拦访等)2400多个预订消费者样本量分析，80%的投诉针对于黑代理、无资质代理、山寨网站、钓鱼网站、假冒网站。如此强大的网站易容术眼下，随着在线旅游知名网站的崛起，许多网站都深受山寨网站等这类的虚假网站的困扰，例如去哪儿网(Qunar.com)、南方航空官方网站(csair.com)以及携程网(ctrip.com)。这些山寨网站为骗取消费者信任，其模仿手段之高明，令人惊叹。此类网站由于缺乏对代理商的资质认证能力，常使消费者利益受到损害。不过，山寨毕竟是山寨，消费者只要仔细观察，细心留意，还是能够看出其中的明显差别。假400电话害人不浅400电话作为一种企业为消费者提供的便捷服务，一直受到广大消费者的欢迎。但是，目前骗子利用手段，在百度一类的通用搜索网站频繁打出广告，广告中提供一个400电话。当消费者拨通该电话时，骗子往往以各种理由让消费者向某个人银行卡中进行汇款。之后，该400电话变成无法接通状态，消费者往往在投诉时才发现上当。去哪儿网机票服务无400电话据记者了解到，全球最大的中文在线旅行网站去哪儿网(Qunar.com)的机票服务是没有400电话的，专线是：01058752660。去哪儿网机票产品部高级总监杨威表示，设定投诉专线能够方便用户识别，防止上当。所以，提供400电话的机票搜索的“去哪儿网”都是冒牌货。此外，杨威提醒消费者在拨打百度搜索到的相关旅游网站400电话时，应该进行反向查询，将400电话放回百度搜索，如出现同一号码提供多家知名旅游网站服务时，则可判定该号码为诈骗电话。山寨如此强大，如何才能辨别真假呢？杨威提示广大消费者可以从以下几个方法去辨别真假网站：第一：看ICP备案，每个正规的网站下方都会有ICP备案的信息，证明其网站的经营合法性。第二：合法的代理商都会有CATA(民航运输协会)的认证资质，与去哪儿网合作的代理商，全部都得通过CATA认证，用户在其他网站上消费的时候，也要仔细辨认是否有CATA认证。第三、正规的代理商都会采用第三方在线支付平台或银行进行交易，比如去哪儿网站会要求代理商必须有这个能力才给予合作，如果有让用户通过汇款的方式交易的，都是骗子网站。所以防止上当受骗最直接的办法就是拒绝直接汇款。“金牌机票服务系统”帮助消费者找到优质代理商值得一提的是，去哪儿网站最近推出的“金牌机票服务系统”可以帮助消费者去伪存真，找到优质放心的代理商。据了解，该系统提供了四个系统平台，从资质、服务、投诉处理、用户监督四个方面提供机票保障服务。包括：1、去哪儿网验证代理人资质的100%的CATA认证代理商体系；2、规范机票代理商管理的代理商投诉管理系统；3、查询去哪儿网搜索的所有机票代理商的详细信息的代理商信息查询系统4、以及将用户评价因素加入搜索排序结果中，以促进代理商改进自身服务的消费者评价排序体系，选择有正规资质的服务商，掌握山寨们的诈骗手段：不直接汇款，不在没有安全保障的支付平台提供账户密码等，双节出行预订机票才能更有保障。	杨威	负向	"There are many tricks on the fake website. How to prevent them from being fake during the double festival travel. As the Double Festival approaches, the booking of air tickets is becoming more and more popular, and the special price air tickets are hard to find. With the increasing use of the Internet by people, there are more and more false websites that use special price air tickets to attract customers' attention. Due to the low threshold of the Internet and the low cost of imitation, the current air ticket booking market is flooded with non mainstream products, and some fake websites even directly use special price tickets for fraud. According to the analysis of 2400 booking consumer samples of the China Consumers Association based on the online travel website ""Qunar.com"" in June - August this year (the survey includes all consumers who have participated in online travel booking, and the survey includes: online questionnaires, telephone interviews, and so on), 80% of the complaints are targeted at black agents, unqualified agents, non mainstream websites, fishing websites, and fake websites. At present, with the rise of well-known online tourism websites, many websites are plagued by fake websites such as non mainstream websites, such as Qunar.com, the official website of China Southern Airlines (csair.com) and Ctrip.com. In order to defraud consumers' trust, their imitation skills are amazing. Because this kind of website lacks the ability to certify the qualifications of agents, it often damages the interests of consumers. However, the non mainstream is still the non mainstream. As long as consumers carefully observe and pay attention, they can still see the obvious difference. The fake 400 telephone is very harmful. The 400 telephone, as a convenient service provided by enterprises to consumers, has always been welcomed by consumers. However, at present, the cheater uses means to frequently advertise on general search websites such as Baidu, which provides a 400 telephone. When consumers dial this telephone, the cheater often asks consumers to make a remittance to someone's bank card for various reasons. After that, the 400 telephone becomes incommunicable, and consumers often find that they have fallen in when complaining. Qunar.com's air ticket service has no 400 telephone. According to the reporter, the world's largest Chinese online travel website, Qunar.com, does not have a 400 telephone for its air ticket service, and the dedicated line is: 01058752660. Yang Wei, senior director of Qunar.com's air ticket products department, said that setting up a complaint hotline can help users identify and prevent them from being cheated. Therefore, the ""Qunar.com"" of the air ticket search providing 400 telephone is a fake. In addition, Yang Wei reminds consumers that when dialing the 400 telephone of the relevant tourism website searched by Baidu, they should conduct a reverse query and put the 400 telephone back to Baidu for search. If the same number provides services for many well-known tourism websites, it can be determined that the number is a fraud telephone. How can we distinguish the true from the false when the non mainstream is so powerful? Yang Wei suggests that consumers can distinguish true and false websites from the following methods: First: Look at ICP filing. Each formal website will have ICP filing information at the bottom to prove its legal operation. Second: Legal agents must have the certification qualifications of CATA (Civil Aviation Transport Association), and the agents cooperating with Qunar.com must all pass the CATA certification. Users also need to carefully identify whether they have CATA certification when consuming on other websites. Third, the formal agents will adopt a third-party online payment platform or bank for transactions. For example, Qunar website will require the agents to have the ability to cooperate. If the users are asked to make transactions through remittances, they are all cheater websites. Therefore, the most direct way to prevent being cheated is to refuse to make direct remittances. ""Gold medal air ticket service system"" helps consumers find high-quality agents. It is worth mentioning that the recently launched ""Gold Medal Air Ticket Service System"" of Qunar website can help consumers distinguish the true from the false and find high-quality and reliable agents. It is understood that the system provides four system platforms, providing air ticket guarantee services from four aspects: qualifications, services, complaint handling and user supervision. Including: 1. 100% CATA certification agent system of Qunar.com to verify the qualification of agents; 2. Agent complaint management system to regulate the management of air ticket agents; 3. Agent information query system to query the detailed information of all air ticket agents searched by Qunar.com4.

烧钱时代的团购仍缺行业标准随着拉手网、大众点评网的相继融资，团购市场已进入烧钱时代。不过，服务质量的落后以及行业标准的缺失，在未来一段时间内，团购网站仍将在摸爬滚打中前行。据国内知名互联网研究机构CNZZ日前发布的数据显示，今年一季度，全国电子商务行业网站数达到2.17万家，同比增长31.16%。其中，团购网站的增长是电子商务行业网站整体增长的主要构成部分。不过，快速的增长势头并不能掩盖市场存在的不足。自2010年3月至今，我国团购网站数量已超过4000家，并且正以每日接近10家的速度在增长。在团购网站发展只有短短一年多的时间里，因为具有建设门槛低、能直接带来现金流、更依赖线下资源等特点，使得一大批中小型网站迅速进入或转型到团购领域。多领域的进入，并没有让团购网站得到较好发展，反而出现了欺诈、质量不达标和服务不到位的问题，让团购网站行业的前景扑朔迷离。对此，嘀嗒团副总裁朱敏告诉记者，目前，中国的团购网站尚处于起步阶段，就像正在学习走路的孩子一般，成长的过程中难免会有磕绊，需要在其间对问题不断地发现以及改善，并形成强有力的服务流程保障体系，以使团购网站未来的道路走得更加顺利。据了解，嘀嗒团联手一茶一坐餐厅推出第二期无限畅吃团购服务，除了一茶一坐“原价品质、预约透明、菜品齐全”的保障，嘀嗒团更是祭出了“全国门店品质服务承诺，嘀嗒团全程提供退款服务”的承诺，将三大服务全面升级。此次嘀嗒团与一茶一坐推出的三大措施在全面提升团购服务体验中，包括了一茶一坐服务升级，其全体门店全力准备迎高峰客流；同时，嘀嗒团服务投诉热线全程待命，“400”热线将在使用期内全程直通一茶一坐客服，统筹全国服务；此外，嘀嗒团全程支持退款，在团购完成后，消费者对网评不满意，嘀嗒团随时提供退款通道为消费者全额退还此次团购的费用。此前，第一期嘀嗒团一茶一坐的团购，虽然受到了消费者的热捧，但是由于各方面准备不足，出现了预约困难、门店准备不足、服务质量问题、网络投诉反馈不及时等缺陷。针对此状况，嘀嗒团积极收集消费者的体验信息，内部进行了多次讨论，并且与一茶一坐进行了深入沟通，再次与一茶一坐联手推出“无限量任你吃”的团购套餐，不仅菜单升级，而且大力提升了服务水平。商报记者李铎	李铎,朱敏	正向	"The group buying in the money-burning era is still short of industry standards. With the successive financing of Lashou.com and Dianping.com, the group buying market has entered the money-burning era. However, the lagging behind of service quality and the lack of industry standards will make the group buying website move forward in the next period of time. According to the data released recently by CNZZ, a well-known domestic Internet research institution, the number of e-commerce industry websites in China reached 21700 in the first quarter of this year, up 31.16% year on year. Among them, the growth of group buying websites is the main part of the overall growth of e-commerce industry websites. However, the rapid growth momentum cannot cover up the shortcomings of the market. Since March 2010, the number of group buying websites in China has exceeded 4000, and it is growing at a rate of nearly 10 per day. In the short period of more than one year since the development of group buying websites, a large number of small and medium-sized websites have quickly entered or transformed into the group buying field because of their low construction threshold, ability to bring about cash flow directly and dependence on offline resources. The entry of multiple fields has not made the group buying website get better development, but there are problems such as fraud, quality not up to standard and service not in place, which makes the prospects of the group buying website industry complicated. In this regard, Zhu Min, vice president of Didi Group, told reporters that at present, the group buying website in China is still in its infancy, like a child who is learning to walk. It is inevitable that there will be bumps in the process of growth, and it is necessary to constantly find and improve problems and form a strong service process guarantee system in the process, so that the future road of the group buying website will be more smooth. It is understood that Didi Group, together with Yichayi Restaurant, launched the second phase of unlimited group buying service. In addition to the guarantee of ""original price quality, reservation transparency, and complete dishes"" of Yichayi, Didi Group has also made a commitment of ""national store quality service commitment, Didi Group provides refund service throughout the process"", upgrading the three services comprehensively. The three major measures launched by Didi Group and Yichayi in this period, which aim to comprehensively upgrade the group buying service experience, include the upgrading of Yichayi services. All its stores are fully prepared to welcome peak passenger flow; At the same time, Didi Group's service complaint hotline is on standby throughout the process. The ""400"" hotline will be directly connected to Yichayi customer service throughout the use period to coordinate services nationwide; In addition, Didi Group fully supports refund. After the group purchase is completed, if consumers are dissatisfied with the online review, Didi Group will always provide a refund channel for consumers to refund the full cost of this group purchase. Previously, the first phase of Didi Group's group buying of Yichayi was welcomed by consumers, but due to insufficient preparation in all aspects, there were defects such as reservation difficulties, store preparation, service quality problems, and untimely online complaint feedback. In view of this situation, Didi Group actively collects consumers' experience information, has many discussions internally, and has in-depth communication with Yichayi. Once again, it launches the ""unlimited eating"" group purchasing package with Yichayi, which not only upgrades the menu, but also greatly improves the service level. Li Duo, business reporter"
中国为08年全球经济增长贡献22%09年贡献更大联合国日前在京发布的《2009年世界经济形势与展望》分析指出，中国仍然是东亚以及全球经济的增长动力，但与欧美的贸易衰减将会使以中国为首的大部分亚洲经济体发展减缓，因此中国需要新的经济战略来维持增长。报告指出，中国为2008年全球经济增长贡献了大约22%，而且在2009年很可能贡献更大，因为大多数发达国家经济都陷入了衰退。不过，中国的增长速度也在放缓，国内生产总值增长从2007年的11.9%下降到2008年的9.1%，但仍算比较高，而预计2009年会降到8%。报告预测熏如果不是因为国内最终需求的持续强劲发展熏下降可能更大。在过去几年全球高速发展的情况下熏中国经济发展在很大程度上受到美国庞大的消费者需求的推动熏而后者又是由信贷条件放宽的刺激和急速上升的房价支撑。中国、日本等国日益增加的贸易盈余积累了大量的外汇储备熏并且愿意购买美元资产熏从而为美国在此阶段的增长提供了资金。然而，这种全球发展模式并不能持续长久。中国和其他发展中国家的出口增长如今已直接和间接地受到美国经济衰退的影响。联合国报告指出熏中国拥有1.9万亿美元外汇储备和平衡的政府预算熏有充足的政策空间可以采用更多必要的扩展型财务政策来刺激国内需求熏从而弥补疲软的出口下滑。中国已开始利用这一政策空间制定大规模的财政刺激计划熏这一举措很可能会恢复全球需求。中国已宣布在2009年和2010年期间实施5860亿美元(或中国国内生产总值的15%)的财政刺激方案。刺激方案旨在加强内需熏重点放在基本设施投资和消费两方面。目标包括低收入住宅、农村基础设施、水、电、运输、环境、技术创新和几个灾区的重建，尤其是5月12日的地震区。该方案还通过各种措施来提高贫困人群的收入，包括更高的补助金和2009年政府对粮食的更高收购价。		正向	China contributed 22% to global economic growth in 08 and even more in 09. The World Economic Situation and Outlook 2009 released by the United Nations in Beijing recently pointed out that China is still the growth engine of East Asia and the global economy, but the trade decline with Europe and the United States will slow down the development of most Asian economies led by China, so China needs a new economic strategy to maintain growth. The report pointed out that China contributed about 22% to the world's economic growth in 2008, and it is likely to contribute more in 2009, because most developed economies have fallen into recession. However, China's growth rate is also slowing down. The GDP growth rate fell from 11.9% in 2007 to 9.1% in 2008, but it is still relatively high, and it is expected to fall to 8% in 2009. The report forecasts that if it were not for the sustained strong development of domestic final demand, the decline would be greater. In the case of rapid global development in the past few years, China's economic development has been largely driven by the huge consumer demand of the United States, which in turn is supported by the easing of credit conditions and the rapid rise of housing prices. China, Japan and other countries' growing trade surplus has accumulated a large amount of foreign exchange reserves, and they are willing to buy dollar assets, thus providing funds for the growth of the United States at this stage. However, this global development model cannot last long. Now, export growth in China and other developing countries has been directly and indirectly affected by the recession in the United States. The United Nations report pointed out that China has US $1.9 trillion of foreign exchange reserves and a balanced government budget, and has sufficient policy space to adopt more necessary expansionary financial policies to stimulate domestic demand, so as to make up for the decline of weak exports. China has begun to use this policy space to formulate a large-scale fiscal stimulus package, a move that is likely to restore global demand. China has announced a fiscal stimulus package of 586 billion US dollars (or 15% of China's GDP) in 2009 and 2010. The purpose of the stimulus package is to strengthen domestic demand, focusing on two aspects: investment in basic facilities and consumption. The objectives include low-income housing, rural infrastructure, water, electricity, transport, environment, technological innovation and reconstruction of several disaster areas, especially the earthquake area on May 12. The program also aims to increase the income of the poor through various measures, including higher grants and higher food purchase prices by the government in 2009.
海通证券：关注中高仓位成长风格基金□海通证券(微博)单开佳倪韵婷近期，不少正面的因素提升了投资者的热情：政策实质性微调引发了投资者很多的憧憬；通胀下行以及房产价格的回落有助于政策有改善的空间；流动性目前相对略显宽松；海外不确定性因素暂时有所缓解。但是，未来市场仍需要一个“经济触底”的现实数据，或者看见一个“新周期的启动”，方可作为右侧启动的信号，因此A股市场可能更多的是震荡反弹走势。目前经济依然处于下滑过程中，可能会导致上市公司盈利能力的下滑，投资者可以更多地关注有产业政策扶持的相关行业，这些行业可能具有攻守兼备的特征，同时一些超跌低估的板块可能也会有反弹的机会，这些机会可能更多的集中在成长板块、部分消费板块。在这样的市场环境中，投资者可以继续买入股票混合型基金，选股能力突出的、仓位中高的主动型基金可能会有一定的超额收益。当然，投资者也可以利用股票型分级基金高风险份额参与反弹。在基金的大类配置上，股票混合型开放式基金建议风格略偏成长，在市场的反弹过程中政策驱动以及估值修复可能具有较好的投资机会。政策驱动包括文化产业、环保、水利、农业补贴、战略新兴产业等；估值修复包含了前期一些超跌板块；业绩稳定性可以关注部分消费类个股。分析这些板块，更多的可能集中在一些偏成长风格的股票中，因此，建议投资者在做基金组合时可以在均衡配置的基础上略偏成长。从交易型基金来看，依据历年走势，通常11月开始是封闭式基金分红行情预演的时点，对应传统封基的折价将会有显著收窄。但今年以来由于市场整体震荡走低，可分配利润少了，多数基金单位可分配利润都在0.1元以下，显著低于历年。不过我们认为四季度市场可能处于一个震荡的过程中，在市场反复的过程中，如果踏准节奏，基金可分配收益或会有一定幅度的增加，加之当前折价回归收益处于今年以来的高位，建议投资者关注选股能力较优、波段把握能力较优且三季度末可分配利润相对较高的基金，这类基金的分红潜力可能更大。对于分级基金而言，在市场震荡反复的格局下，股票型高风险份额可能将有较多波段性的机会，但由于右侧经济和盈利的拐点未现，市场的反弹仍需谨慎，因而高风险份额的收益需要及时兑现。对于债券分级基金高风险份额可能仍有正收益，但是行情相比前期那波反弹或较弱。目前市场上所有低风险份额的折价有显著的回归，折价率虽然可能仍有收窄空间，但空间或小于前期，但随着到期折算期限的临近，即将折算的低风险份额折价进一步扩大的动力不大，投资者可继续持有。从指数基金以及ETF而言，市场左侧大底部明朗，因而长线仍可布局，同时来回震荡行情中投资者可采用交投简便的ETF博取波段。11月债券市场略偏利好，在历经了较长时间债券熊市之后，债券基金的配置价值重新回归。而随着央行公开市场操作，短期市场资金面可能略微宽松，因而我们认为货币基金下月的收益或略有下降。不过对于现金流动性要求较高的投资者而言，货币基金仍是目前最有效的现金管理工具。在构建基金组合上，我们对积极型、稳健型以及保守型三类不同风险承受能力的投资者给予资产配置比例的建议。我们给予这三类投资者在权益类基金(包含股票、混合型基金以及交易型基金)一个配置比例区间，分别为积极型配置区间60-100%；稳健型30-80%，保守型10-40%，均衡配置比例分别为80%、55%和25%。当我们判断市场上涨概率较大时，我们会在权益类基金上配置较高的比例，反之则降低比例。本期建议积极型投资者可以配置75%的主动型股票混合型基金，15%的交易型基金(含指数型基金)，10%的偏债型基金；稳健型投资者可以配置55%的主动型股票混合型基金、10%的交易型基金(含指数型基金)、20%的偏债型基金、15%的货币市场基金；保守型投资者可以配置35%的主动型股票混合型基金、20%的偏债型基金、45%的货币市场基金。	倪韵婷,单开佳	正向	"Haikot Securities: Pay attention to the growth style fund of China and high position□ Haikot Securities (microblog) Shen Kaijia Ni Yunting recently, many positive factors have enhanced investors' enthusiasm: the substantive micro adjustment of policies has triggered a lot of expectations of investors; The decline of inflation and housing prices will help to improve the policy space; At present, liquidity is slightly loose; Overseas uncertainties have temporarily eased. However, the future market still needs a ""real data of economic bottoming out"", or a ""launch of a new cycle"", as a signal of right launch. Therefore, the A-share market may be more volatile.

关小刀火线解盘：拉齐奥值得力捧桑坦德持续低迷新浪体育讯　1、巡游者VS维拉推荐：31维拉前边的比赛平局过多，因此虽然迄今不败，但成绩却不太理想；巡游者迄今已有两场胜利，可惜主场不但没有积分，甚至连进球都没有取得过，这个多少令QPR的球迷多少有些失望。由于两队联赛的轨迹久未交集，近年只在联赛杯中有过两次交锋，各有一场胜利。平均赔率2.303.203.01实际上是暗挺巡游者，主流公司的赔率调整中，多家公司的主胜赔率在周中之后均有明显下调。在客队保持不败的情况下，巡游者能够让出平半高水，还是可以看高一线。2、科隆VS霍芬海姆推荐：30本季科隆的表现总是出人意料，仅有的两次胜利均来自客场，而且还都是打入对手4球的大胜，但主场却一胜难求，3场联赛进球也只有两粒，看起来防守反击才是科隆安身立命的看家法宝；近两场打入7球的霍芬海姆同样进球如麻，而且主客场的表现更加均衡。两队在德甲中共有6次交锋，霍芬海姆在前三次连胜之后，最近三次遇到科隆均没有占到便宜。由于科隆的表现欠缺稳定，所以平均赔率2.843.312.31仍然是看好客场作战的霍芬海姆，两队近期力火都比较猛，本场打出大比分的可能性较大。3、不来梅VS赫塔推荐：31柏林赫塔的上一个客场把卫冕冠军多特拉下马，不过挑战不来梅却没有往绩优势，近4次做客都输掉了比赛。本季不来梅的开局相当不错，似乎在完成球员的新陈代谢之后，沙夫教练将率领不来梅步又一个黄金时期，目前不来梅的成绩、状态和数据都相当出色，因此主场迎战赫塔亦可看高。只是目前的平均赔率1.813.484.04给得有些蛊惑，即使赫塔前3个客场1胜2平保持不败，但毕竟是一支刚刚回到德甲的升班马，而且在夏季转会中并没有大肆买人提升实力，因此排名第2的不来梅仅仅让出半球低水，盘赔均不太合理，本场冷门不得不防。4、锡耶纳VS莱切推荐：32002年以来在甲乙两级和杯赛的交锋中，锡耶纳对莱切1胜6平4负处于完全下风。新季开打之后，两队的成绩都不出意料排名下游，上个客场莱切战胜博洛尼亚表现得较为出色，但主场输给亚特兰大显示这支球队的表现还不足以信任。平均赔率1.953.163.84却是对迄今不胜的锡耶纳更为看好，周中联赛结束之后，多数主流公司放均明显降低了主胜赔率，多家公司均将主胜从2.05以上降到2.00以下，亚洲初盘半球中水，锡耶纳值得一博。5、亚特兰大VS诺瓦拉推荐：31两支升班马均表现不错，亚特兰大3轮拿7分排名前列，诺瓦拉则上轮力克国米拿到意甲首胜——当然，战胜国米有对手将帅不和的因素，诺瓦拉的胜利也直接导致加斯佩里尼最终下课。两队上季在意乙有过两次交锋，亚特兰大1平1负处于下风。两队虽然目前的积分是亚特兰大领先，但实际上由于夏季转会中都没有引入能够明显提升球队的球星，因此两队实力应当还是在同一档次，亚特兰大的成绩有很大偶然性，平均赔率1.783.264.55对亚特兰大更为看好，亚洲初盘多开到半一超高水，主队也并非稳操胜券。6、卡利亚里VS乌迪内推荐：31三轮过后，两队分别有6分和7分入账，表现相当出色。2000年以来两队在意甲共交锋16次，乌迪内9胜3平4负占据明显的上风，其中近5次相遇从未被卡利亚里击败过。平均赔率2.463.112.78与上季乌迪内前来挑战相比，客胜赔率有比较明显的提升，这也说明在经历过夏季转会的运筹之后，乌迪内的实力还是有所下降到的，主流公司中BWIN和Centrebet等在周中之后有压低主胜的调整趋势，本场可以谨慎看好主队不败。7、卡塔尼亚VS尤文推荐：10对博洛尼亚的比赛中武西尼奇功过各半，尤文也因此结束了连胜势头，不过对于上赛季连欧战资格都没捞到的尤文来说，现在的开局表现的确能够明显提升球队的自信。《都灵体育报》预测尤文的阵容将会做出一些调整，埃里亚取代停赛的武西尼奇，马特里作为单箭头，尤文可能会摆出一个4141的阵形，这应当也是为下轮迎战AC米兰(微博)作战术准备。平均赔率3.833.161.96很正路地看好尤文客让半球中水，双选尤文客场不败比较稳妥。8、帕尔马VS罗马推荐：30关于罗马的焦点在于，如果罗马继续不胜，恩里克会不会步加斯佩里尼的后尘？除了因伤缺阵的斯特克伦博格，罗马其他主力均能出场，恩里克如何选择阵容因此也更加引人注目。两队的交锋中罗马占据绝对优势，2001年以来在联赛和杯赛中对帕尔马15胜3平2负，其中客场也是连续6次交锋保持不败。帕尔马是目前意甲失球最多的球队之一，面对罗马的前锋防线告破的可能性较大，不过随着乔温科的复出，帕尔马坐镇主场也有进球机会。由于恩里克指挥罗马在本赛季的正式比赛中还未胜过，平均赔率2.883.082.39因此对客队的信心也不是很强，本场两队打出大比分的可能性较大，看好两队分胜负。9、拉齐奥VS巴勒莫推荐：3一度以请辞来激将的雷贾终于率领拉齐奥获得赛季首胜，预计本场将延续上轮的首发阵容；巴勒莫在力克卡利亚里之后取得主场两连胜，不过第一个客场输给亚特兰大的表现还是相对弱了一些。两队历史交锋中势均力敌，各胜6场之外只有3场平局。尽管积分上巴勒莫尚处领先地位，但平均赔率1.813.314.27还是认为夏天走了多名核心之后，巴勒莫还将遇到更多的考验，亚洲初盘半球低水，可以考虑拉齐奥主胜做胆。10、莱万特VS西班牙人推荐：31两队交锋中莱万特1胜3平4负处于明显下风，不过本季莱万特的表现令人刮目相看，上周末爆冷战胜皇马(微博)之后，莱万特士气上扬，再接再厉客场又拿下瓦列卡诺，目前竟然排名前列；西班牙人仍然保持着主场出色的特点，目前的6分全部来自主场，客场却先后输给马洛卡和萨拉戈萨，遭到两连败。平均赔率2.073.223.43正路看好成绩出人意料的莱万特，主流公司的主胜赔率多数是从2.30以上下调到2.00－2.05之间，亚洲初盘给到平半低水，可以小敲主队不败。11、格兰纳达VS奥萨苏纳推荐：10格兰纳达上一个主场战胜维拉利尔取得首胜，从实力上来看，这支1976年降级之后首次重返西甲的球队无疑是本季降级的大热门，而且阵中缺少拥有丰富西甲经验的球员，这对于格兰纳达的保级相当不利；从比赛过程和数据上来看，格兰纳达战胜维拉利尔有很大的偶然性，其他3场联赛一球未进还是很说明问题的。平均赔率2.223.173.13略为倾向主场作战的格兰纳达，不过从主流公司的赔率体系来看，本场客胜的几率似乎更高一些。12、希洪VS桑坦德推荐：32001年以来两队在甲乙两级交锋中，希洪1胜2平5负处于完全下风，唯一的胜利是上季西甲倒数第2轮，希洪在战胜桑坦德之后才算是彻底保级成功。本季两队的开局都不好，希洪4连败积分垫底，桑坦德也是迄今不胜，排名倒数第4。平均赔率2.053.223.49仍然是略为倾向主场作战的希洪，主流公司的主胜基本分布在2.00－2.05区间，亚洲初盘给主队半球高水，本场上盘值得一博。13、萨拉戈萨VS马拉加推荐：30马拉加取得三连胜，3场比赛的得失球为6:0，智利工程师执教的功夫逐渐显露出来，除了佩莱格里尼之外，还有谁能在短期之内将众多新人捏合成为一支防守如此出色的球队！萨拉戈萨的主帅阿吉雷(JavierAguirre)亦是业内名帅，曾执教奥萨苏纳、马竞以及墨西哥国家队。平均赔率3.193.302.14及其调整还是看好客场作战的马拉加，不过近两场比赛萨拉戈萨的进攻打得很猛，马拉加并无必胜把握。14、雷恩VS圣埃蒂安推荐：3两队近期交锋中，雷恩在法甲和杯赛中5胜2平优势明显。本赛季的开局阶段，雷恩也表现得十分出色，目前是排名积分榜的第2位，而且是法甲进球最多的球队。值得注意的是，雷恩迄今的17粒入球是由9名球员打入的，这说明雷恩的进攻并未完全依赖进攻核心蒙塔诺(VictorMontano，哥伦比亚前锋)，球队的进攻点多，得分手法多样，令对手不太好防。圣埃蒂安开局两连胜之后突然陷入低迷，近5轮法甲只拿到2分，过多的伤病显然对球队的影响较大。平均赔率1.783.284.47与往季比较变化不大，主场作战的雷恩胜望颇浓。临场推荐和任九实战请关注关小刀(微博)的博客(关小刀)	阿吉雷,沙夫,埃里亚,马特里,蒙塔诺,武西尼奇,雷贾,加斯佩里尼,斯特克伦博格,恩里克,关小刀,乔温科	正向	Guan Xiaodao's fire line solution: Lazio is worth praising Santander for his continuous low progress. Sina Sports News 1. The cruiser VS Villa recommends: 31 Villa has too many draws in the previous game, so although it has not been defeated so far, the results are not ideal; The cruiser has had two victories so far. Unfortunately, the home team has not even scored a goal. This is somewhat disappointing to QPR fans. Since the two teams' league trajectories have not intersected for a long time, they have only had two clashes in the league cup in recent years, each with a victory. The average probability of 2.303.203.01 is actually dark praise for the cruise. In the adjustment of the odds of mainstream companies, the main victory probability of many companies has been significantly reduced after the middle of the week. When the visiting team remained unbeaten, the cruiser could give half of the high water, or it could be regarded as a top line. 2. Cologne VS Hoffenheim recommended: 30 The performance of Cologne this season is always unexpected. The only two victories came from away games, and they were all great victories of scoring four goals to the opponent, but the home team could not win, and there were only two goals in three league games, which seems to be counterattack. The equally goal of Hoffenheim, which has scored seven goals in the past two games, is also like a monster, and the performance at home and away is more balanced. The two teams have had six confrontations in the Bundesliga. Hoffenheim has not taken any advantage in the three recent encounters with Cologne after three consecutive victories. Since Cologne's performance is lacking in stability, the average probability of 2.843.312.31 is still optimistic about Hoffenheim, which is playing away from home. The two teams have a fierce competition recently, and it is possible to make a big score in this game. 3. Bremen VS Hertha recommended: 31 Hertha BSC's last away game brought down the defending champion Dortmund, but there was no past performance advantage in challenging Bremen, and he lost the game in his last four visits. Bremen had a good start this season. After completing the新陈代谢 of players, Coach Shauf will lead Bremen to another golden period. At present, Bremen's performance, status and data are quite good, so it is also possible to welcome Hertha at home. However, the average probability of 1.813.484.04 is somewhat misleading. Even if Hertha kept unbeaten in the first three away games with 1 win and 2 draws, it is after all a newly promoted horse that has just returned to the Bundesliga. Moreover, it did not buy people to enhance its strength in the summer transfer, so the second ranked Bremen only gave half a low water ball, and the game was unreasonable, and it was inevitable to guard against a cold game. 4. Siena VS Lecce recommended: 32 Since 2002, Siena has been at a complete disadvantage in the confrontation with Lecce in the two levels of甲and乙and the cup. After the new season started, the performance of the two teams was unexpectedly low. In the last away game, Lecce beat Bologna well, but the home defeat to Atalanta showed that the performance of the team was not worth trusting. The average probability of 1.953.163.84 is more optimistic about Siena, who has not won so far. After the league ended in the middle of the week, the majority of mainstream companies have significantly reduced the main victory probability. Many companies have reduced the main victory from more than 2.05 to less than 2.00. The Asian half court is medium water. Siena is worth a bet. 5. Atalanta VS Novara recommended: 31 The two promoted horses both performed well. Atalanta took 7 points in three rounds and ranked first, while Novara beat Inter Milan in the last round to win the first victory of Serie A - of course, Inter Milan lost because of the disagreement between the coach and the coach, and the victory of Novara also led to Gasperi's final resignation. The two teams had two confrontations in the Serie B last season, and Atalanta lost 1-1. Although Atalanta is currently leading the league in terms of points, in fact, neither of them has introduced star players who can obviously improve the team due to the summer transfer, so the two teams should still be at the same level. Atalanta's achievements are very accidental. The average probability of 1.783.264.55 is more optimistic about Atalanta. The Asian primary court has opened a super high water level of half a goal, and the home team is not necessarily going to win. 6. Cagliari VS Udine recommended: 31 After three rounds, the two teams scored 6 points and 7 points respectively, which was quite good. Since 2000, the two teams have played 16 games in Serie A. Udine has a clear advantage of 9 wins, 3 draws and 4 losses, including 5 times they have never been defeated by Cagliari. The average probability of 2.463.112.78 and the last season of Udine coming to challenge is compared with the last season, the probability of winning the guest game has been significantly increased, which also shows that after the summer transfer, the strength of Udine has declined. BWIN and Centrebet in major companies have a trend of lowering the main victory after the middle of the week. It is prudent to think that the main team is not defeated in this game. 7. Catania VS Juventus recommended: 10 Wuchinic's credit and demerit were equal in the game against Bologna, and Juventus also ended its winning streak. However, for Juventus, which did not get the qualification for the European war last season, the current opening performance can really enhance the team's confidence. < Turin Sports Daily > predicts that Juventus' team will make some adjustments. Eria will take the place of Wuchinic, who has been suspended. Matri is a single spear. Juventus may put out a 4141 formation, which should also be a tactical preparation for the next round to meet AC Milan (microblog). The average probability of 3.833.161.96 is very optimistic about Juventus' guest giving half a ball of medium water, and it is more stable to choose the double non-defeat of Juventus in the guest game. 8. Parma VS Rome recommended: 30 The focus on Rome is whether Enrique will follow Gasperi's example if Rome continues to win? In addition to Stekelenburg, who was absent due to injury, all the other main players of Rome can play, so it is more noteworthy how Enrique chooses the team. In the confrontation between the two teams, Rome has an absolute advantage. Since 2001, Parma has won 15 wins, 3 draws and 2 losses in the league and cup, including six consecutive undefeated games away from home. Parma is

He was not afraid of being cheated by women. Chen Mugeng, a reporter from Chen Mugeng, is going to be released on August 6. Yesterday, Chen Mugeng, the director of ""Everyone on Guard"", brought the main actors Guo Fucheng, Zou Shaolong, Zhang Jingchu, Wu Jing and other Shanghai publicists.

For the first question, Zou Shaolong is the most popular. The other three all choose him.

赶集网多名高管因公关风波离职日前，赶集网多名高管突然集体离职，舆论掀起对赶集网被愚弄的猜测：由姚晨代言的赶集网花了2亿元做广告，但因为广告中的驴子太过“招摇”，被赶驴网钻了空子。有网友甚至大呼，赶集网上了敌人当了！与此同时，赶集网的关注度和搜索量急剧上升。赶集网真的上当了吗？凭一篇公关稿蹿红的赶驴网真能把赶集网“公关”下去?赶驴网凭公关稿蹿红“赶集啦！我有一只小毛驴，我从来也不骑。”这句广告词对于经常出行的人来说恐怕不会陌生。从2月初开始，由姚晨代言的15秒钟赶集网广告片同时在中央电视台、地铁和公交移动电视等媒体上循环播放，开展“地毯式”的营销轰炸。令人没想到的是，赶集网的竞争对手百姓网注册了一个“山寨”的赶驴网，借了一把赶集网的风。赶驴网不仅做了一个类似于赶集网的网站标识，还提出类似于赶集网“赶集网，啥都有”的口号——“赶驴网，啥没有？”，“山寨”度相当惊人。此外，诸如《2亿广告费炒红赶驴网》等文章一夜之间在网上广为传播，内容大多称百姓网成功地四两拨千斤，仅花费200元注册了赶驴网的域名“ganlvwang”，就坐享赶集网数亿元广告效果，流量大幅攀升。在业内人士看来，这不过是一场华丽的炒作。赶集网的广告在2月初开始播出，网民对赶驴网的搜索量一直不多。直至当月19日网上出现关于赶驴网的文章时，搜索量才有了较大的提升。赶集网用公关反击舆论似乎并不同情被“山寨”的赶集网。相反，网上出现“赶集网就知道砸钱”和“广告创意存在缺陷”等质疑声。对此，赶集网迅速发起公关反击。名人的议论无疑对本次“驴子事件”起到了扩大效应。创新工场李开复在微博上出了一道题：“考考大家：赶集网首页下方有个‘赶驴网’的友情链接，但点开后才发现是链接到赶集网，又回到原页。为什么？”其实，这不过是赶集网为了防止赶驴网分走流量而作的反击。此外，赶集网还迅速购买了“赶驴”的关键字搜索。3月15日，广告创意人叶茂中在微博中表示：“因为赶集网广告片‘小毛驴篇’大获成功，赶集网投资人今日资本总裁徐新今天送我一台最新款‘苹果’庆贺。”业内人士称，这一做法有明显的危机公关痕迹。赶集网CEO杨浩涌说：“‘赶驴网’占整个搜索流量的千分之一不到。作为企业，更应该关注产品的用户体验和公司长期发展战略，而不是一些小技巧。小技巧带来了几百个用户，但伤害了品牌。说得再过一些，即使抢注了开心网的域名，那又能怎样？过了几年，有谁还记得这个赶驴网？”高管离职原因存疑最近两天，随着赶驴网的关注度下降，赶集网的关注度趋稳。正当外界认为此事将告一段落时，赶集网主管市场与公关的副总裁邓漫、主管SEO（SEO指利用搜索引擎的搜索规则来提高网站在搜索引擎内的排名）的副总裁吕英建以及SEO总监郭彦景离职。杨浩涌向记者证实了这一消息。杨浩涌并未透露这些高管的离职原因。他否认是因为“驴子事件”炒了这些人鱿鱼。他表示：“离职是在广告投放前的1月份。广告效果很好，我们会继续加大投放。”然而，郭彦景的微博显示，郭在2月的最后一天才离职。对此，一位网友疾呼：“赶驴广告即便弄巧成拙，也很容易反拙为巧，何错之有？自毁长城，上敌人的当了！”业内人士指出，因为一个广告就导致公司高管引咎辞职，这不免有些荒唐。就专业角度而言，赶集网的广告没有致命伤，其立体轰炸+经典歌谣+名人代言的效果显而易见。一场华丽的炒作从赶驴网的冒出，到赶集网的反击，再到赶集网高管的离职，赶集网关注度也保持了直线上升，刚注册的赶驴网也获得了相当的关注度。这场争斗中，究竟谁赢了？谁被公关了？首先，赶驴网利用网络公关稿制造舆论，购买关键词，高调“山寨”，迅速招致媒体和网民的关注。其后，赶集网的广告受到舆论质疑，赶集网、投资人和广告人纷纷加入危机公关。待事件即将平息时，赶集网高管离职，将舆论推向另一个小高潮。“如果没有赶驴网的‘毛驴’横插一腿，赶集网的百度关注指数将保持高位，直至3月初。然后随着广告影响力的下降，关注指数下降。”一位业内人士分析说，“赶驴网的‘山寨’让更多的人知道赶集网，将其品牌进行了二次放大。”在这次事件中，赶驴网的公关偷袭和赶集网的反攻都没有出现殊死搏斗的场景。就赶驴网而言，“这算是一次不错的公关炒作。”网络公关专家赵勇评论说，“赶集网的广告投放后，立刻引起了百姓网的关注。百姓网没有足够的资金展开正面竞争，便想出了赶驴网的策略，并在网上发布软文进行公关。”据记者了解，许多网民确实是看了网上的公关稿后才知道赶驴网，并不是从赶集网的广告直接联想到“赶驴”二字。(孙雨)	叶茂中,吕英建,徐新,李开复,郭彦景,姚晨,杨浩涌,赵勇,邓漫	正向	"A number of executives of Ganji.com left their jobs due to a public relations crisis. Recently, a number of executives of Ganji.com suddenly left their jobs collectively, public opinion has speculated that Ganji.com has been fooled: Yao Chen, the spokesman of Ganji.com, spent 200 million yuan on advertising, but the donkey in the advertisement is too ""showy"", which has been taken advantage of by Ganji.com. Some netizens even shouted that the enemy was on the gathering network! At the same time, the attention and search volume of Ganji.com have risen sharply. Did the gathering network really fall for it? Can the donkey net, which has become popular with a public relations document, really ""public relations"" the gathering network down? The donkey net became popular with a public relations document, ""Come on! I have a little donkey, I never ride."" This advertisement is probably not unfamiliar to people who often travel. Since the beginning of February, the 15 second Ganji advertisement endorsed by Yao Chen has been循环played on media such as CCTV, subway and bus mobile TV, and a ""carpet style"" marketing bombardment has been carried out. Unexpectedly, Ganji.com's competitor, People's Network, registered a ""pirated"" donkey network, borrowing a lot of money from the gathering network. The donkey network not only made a website logo similar to the gathering network, but also put forward a slogan similar to the gathering network - ""the donkey network, nothing?"", which is quite surprising. In addition, articles such as ""200 million advertising expenses to stir up the donkey network"" spread widely on the Internet overnight, mostly saying that the people's network has successfully spent two thousand dollars, only 200 yuan to register the donkey network's domain name ""ganlvwang"", and enjoys the advertising effect of billions of yuan from the gathering network, and the traffic has risen sharply. In the view of industry insiders, this is just a gorgeous炒作. Ganji's advertisement began to air in early February, and netizens have not searched for much about Ganji. Not until the 19th of this month did the online article about Donkey Net appear, and the search volume increased significantly. Ganji.com used public relations to counter public opinion, which seems to have no sympathy for the ""pirated"" Ganji.com. On the contrary, the Internet has come up with questions such as ""Ganji just wants to throw money"" and ""there are defects in advertising creativity"". In this regard, Ganji Network quickly launched a public relations counterattack. The discussion of celebrities undoubtedly had an amplification effect on this ""donkey event"". Li Kaifu of Innovation Factory asked a question on microblog: ""Examine everyone: There is a 'Donkey Net' friendship link below the home page of Ganji. However, when you click on it, you find that it is linked to Ganji, and then return to the original page. Why?"" In fact, this is just a counter attack of Ganji in order to prevent Donkey Network from sharing traffic. In addition, Ganji Network quickly purchased the keyword ""donkey"". On March 15, Ye Maozhong, an advertising creative person, said on his microblog: ""Because the 'Little Donkey' chapter of the Ganji Network advertisement was a great success, Xu Xin, the president of Ganji Network's investor Today Capital, sent me the latest 'Apple' to celebrate today."" Industry insiders said that this practice had obvious crisis public relations marks. Yang Haoyong, CEO of Ganji.com, said: ""The 'Donkey Network' accounts for less than one thousandth of the total search traffic. As an enterprise, we should pay more attention to the user experience of products and the long-term development strategy of the company, rather than some small skills. Small skills bring hundreds of users, but hurt the brand. To put it another way, even if you grab the domain name of Kaixin.com, what can you do? In a few years, who will remember this donkey network?"" The reason for the resignation of executives is questionable. In the past two days, with the decline of the attention of Donkey Network, the attention of Ganji Network has stabilized. Just when the outside world thought that this matter would come to an end, Deng Man, the vice president in charge of marketing and public relations of Ganji.com, Lv Yingjian, the vice president in charge of SEO (SEO refers to the use of search engines' search rules to improve the ranking of websites in search engines), and Guo Yanjing, the director of SEO, left. Yang Haoyong confirmed the news to the reporter. Yang Haoyong did not disclose the reasons for the resignation of these executives. He denied that it was because of the ""donkey incident"" that these people were fired. He said: ""The resignation was in January, before the advertisement was launched. The advertising effect is good, we will continue to increase the investment."" However, Guo Yanjing's microblog shows that Guo resigned on the last day of February. In this regard, a netizen cried out: ""Even if the donkey advertisement is clever, it is easy to turn it around. What's wrong? Self destruct the Great Wall, and take the enemy's lead!"" Industry insiders pointed out that it was ridiculous that an advertisement could lead to the resignation of the company's executives. In terms of professionalism, the advertisement of Ganji.com has no fatal damage, and its effect of stereo bombing + classic nursery rhymes + celebrity endorsement is obvious. From the emergence of Donkey Network, to the counterattack of Ganji Network, and then to the resignation of Ganji executives, the attention of Ganji Network has also risen steadily, and the newly registered Donkey Network has also received considerable attention. Who won in this fight? Who was publicized? First, Donkey Network uses online public relations manuscripts to create public opinion, purchase keywords, and publicize ""pirated"" versions in a high-profile manner, which quickly causes the media and netizens to pay attention. Later, the advertisement of Ganji.com was questioned by public opinion, and Ganji.com, investors and advertisers all joined in the crisis public relations. When the incident was about to calm down, the executives of Ganji.com resigned, pushing public opinion to another small climax. ""If the 'Donkey' of the Donkey Network does not cross its legs, the Baidu Attention Index of the Gathering Network will remain high until the beginning of March. Then, as the influence of the advertisement decreases, the attention index decreases."" An industry insider analyzed that ""The 'pirated' version of Donkey Network has let more people know about the Gathering Network, which has amplified its brand for the second time."" In this event, neither the public relations sneak attack of Donkey Network nor the counterattack of Ganji Network showed a scene of a fight to the death. In terms of Donkey Network, ""This is a good public relations炒作."" Zhao Yong, a network public relations expert, commented that ""After the advertisement of Ganji.com was launched, it immediately attracted the attention of the People's Network. The People's Network does not have enough funds to launch a positive competition, so it comes up with the strategy of catching donkeys and publishes soft articles online for public relations."" According to the reporter, many netizens really know the donkey network only after they have seen the online public relations draft, not from the advertisement of the donkey network. (Sun Yu)"
下跌市股东增持逾3亿股94%获利《投资者报》分析员杨秀红股指节节败退，股东增持潮纷至沓来。自4月16日股指期货推出，A股市场就一直在震荡下跌中。上证综指4月及5月跌幅约分别达到8%和10%。市场大跌两市哀鸿遍野之际，上市公司股东逆市增持的消息却不断传来，很多忍不住减仓的投资者开始犹豫。据《投资者报》数据研究部的统计，4月以来，上市公司股东已增持逾3亿股，其中5月增持市值超越减持市值，一举实现净增值。2008年10月浮现以来，时隔19个月，这一现象再度重现。观察本轮增持潮背后的“推手”，上市公司的高管表现得热情很高，多家公司出现10余位高管集体增持的场面。不过各家高管的增持数量则是“雷声大雨点小”，大部分高管增持数量均在10万股以下。真正进行大规模增持的，则是“公司”类股东，其增持数量占到本轮增持总量的九成以上。在激进增持后，上市公司股东多有斩获，增持股票在4月及5月的大跌市中大面积逆市上扬、为其带来不菲的账面浮盈。5月增持量创19个月新高据《投资者报》数据研究部统计，今年以来，以月度为单位，在1月累计公告增持数量超过1亿股后，2、3月份迅速萎缩到不足873万股和212万股。伴随着4月以来市场的急速下挫，上市公司股东月度增持规模出现了大规模回升。其中，4月公告增持数量达到2199万股，环比增长逾9倍。此后，在股市继续下探寻底的5月，更是涌现出少有的增持潮，其月度增持数量一举攀升到3亿股左右，环比飙升逾12倍，这是继2009年9月之后，增持数量再度接近3亿股大关。历史上月增持数量超过3亿股的月份也仅有10余个。与此同时，上市公司股东公告增持市值也随之出现大幅波动：1月增持市值创出小新高，接近16亿元，而2月、3月增持市值则下滑到2.8亿元和0.3亿元。随着4月、5月增持潮的涌现，股东公告增持市值也分别回升至3.5亿元和32亿元。截至6月15日，4月以来上市公司股东已经合计增持约3.2亿股，增持市值超过35亿元。在5月汹涌的增持潮和减持规模退潮的背后，催生了罕见的净增持现象。据我部统计，5月股东累计公告增持市值接近32亿元，一举超越同期约19亿元的公告减持规模。Wind资讯统计显示，以月度为单位，A股市场上次出现股东净增持的时间为2008年10月份，当月上市公司股东合计公告增持市值为11亿元，公告减持市值为10亿元。这意味着，时隔19个月后，A股市场股东再现净增持现象。且今年5月股东净增持规模比2008年10月股市见底之时的势头更猛烈。据我们此前的统计，上市公司股东增持潮一般在市场筑底阶段出现，如2005年10月、2008年9月等。此次，大股东再次推动新一轮增持潮，无疑给处于“熊途”的投资者一线希望。长江电力再成增持主要目标观察本轮增持潮背后的主要“幕后推手”，无外乎三大主力，即公司、高管和个人。按增持股东类型(公司、高管、个人)划分，4月以来发布的78次增持公告中，有71次增持出自高管和公司之手，占总数的91%。其中，高管公告增持次数达到46次，居首位。有多家公司涌现了众多高管一齐增持的局面。如南通科技、长航油运、柳化股份等，其背后增持的高管多达10余位。其中，长航油运增持公告显示，5月13日、14日，包括该公司董事长刘锡汉、副董事长朱宁、总经理李万锦等在内的13位高管对自家股票进行了回购，其合计购入股票数量约57万股，成交价格在5.37元至5.5元之间。柳化股份增持公告也显示，5月13日、14日，公司董事长廖能成、副董事长、总经理覃永强、董事苏东升等10位高管共计购入约67万股。每位上市公司高管增持数量，大部分都在10万股以下，多数只购入两三万股；5月增持最多的高管——宗申动力的董事长左宗申增持100万股，增持市值仅为1015万元，且所有高管的增持数量仅390万股，占4月以来总增持量的1.2%，增持势头明显是“雷声大雨点小”。相对于高管的增持，一些“公司”类股东显得较为激进。4月以来累计以“公司”身份增持的股东有16家，合计增持数量达到3.1亿股，合计增持市值达到34.6亿元，占总数的98%。据Wind数据统计，4月公告增持的公司有两家，分别为冀东水泥和中兴商业，5月公告增持的公司则迅速攀升到22家，增持数量最多前两家为长江电力和国电电力。前者的大股东长江三峡集团合计公告增持超1亿股，增持市值逾14亿元；后者的大股东中国国电集团公司合计买入8153万股，公告增持市值达5.43亿元。作为增持主力军，长江电力并非第一次担当月度增持冠军的角色。在今年1月的增持中，长江电力控股股东长江三峡集团就在当月增持了1亿多股，成为当月增持的领军人物。历史上的增持潮中，该集团曾多次出手，大规模回购自家股票。如2009年8月的超千万股增持，2006年7月的近2亿股的增持等。本轮增持潮股东94%获利我部统计了始于今年4月的这场增持潮中股东们的“账单”，结果显示多数股东获得了不错的回报。在4月以来的78次增持公告中，我们剔除了实际发生在今年二季度以前的增持行为。其中，国电电力、海信电器和柳化股份等三家公司，因为在股东增持之后实施了分红送配方案，我们根据其送转方案另行计算了其账面盈亏情况。对于其余上市公司，我们均按照股东平均增持成本及最新股价(6月11日收盘价，下同)的差价测算。最终测算结果显示，94%的增持为其股东带来正收益。在今年5月进行增持且在5月发布增持公告的公司中，海信电器股东青岛海信电子公司的盈利幅度最大，达到26%。此外，宗申动力、上海金陵、南通科技等也为其增持股东带来了超10%的正收益。	杨秀红,廖能成,刘锡汉,朱宁,覃永强,苏东升,李万锦,左宗申	正向	"The shares of shareholders in the falling market increased by more than 300 million shares, 94% of them made profits. Yang Xiuhong, an analyst of the Investor newspaper, reported that the stock index was retreating one after another, and the shareholders were increasing their shares. Since the launch of stock index futures on April 16, the A-share market has been in a state of volatility and decline. The declines of Shanghai Composite Index in April and May were about 8% and 10% respectively. At the time of the market's huge decline, the news of shareholders of listed companies increasing their shares in the market kept coming, and many investors who could not help reducing their positions began to hesitate. According to the statistics of the Data Research Department of the Investor newspaper, since April, shareholders of listed companies have increased more than 300 million shares, and the market value of the shares increased in May has exceeded the market value of the shares reduced, achieving a net increase in one fell swoop. Nineteen months later, this phenomenon reappeared in October 2008. The executives of listed companies behind the ""pusher"" of this round of increase tide showed great enthusiasm, and more than a dozen executives of many companies collectively increased their holdings. However, the number of shares increased by executives of each company is ""thunderstorm and small raindrop"", and most of the executives' shares increased by less than 100000 shares. The real large-scale increase is the ""company"" shareholders, and the number of shares they increase accounts for more than 90% of the total number of shares in this round of increase. After the aggressive increase, shareholders of listed companies have made a lot of achievements. The shares increased in April and May rose against the market in the face of the huge decline in the market, bringing considerable floating profits to them. According to the statistics of the Data Research Department of the Investor's Report, the amount of shares increased in May hit a new high in 19 months. Since this year, in January, the cumulative number of shares announced to increase in January exceeded 100 million shares, and then rapidly shrank to less than 8.73 million shares and 2.12 million shares in February and March. With the sharp decline of the market since April, the monthly increase of shareholders of listed companies has shown a large-scale recovery. In April, the number of shares announced to be increased reached 21.99 million shares, up more than nine times month on month. After that, in May, when the stock market continued to bottom out, there was a rare increase trend, and the number of shares increased in the month climbed to around 300 million, up more than 12 times month on month. This is the second time that the number of shares increased has approached the 300 million share mark since September 2009. There are also only more than a dozen months in history when the number of shares increases in a month exceeds 300 million. At the same time, the market value of shareholders' announcement of listed companies also showed a large fluctuation: the market value of the announcement of the increase in January hit a new low of nearly 1.6 billion yuan, while the market value of the announcement of the increase in February and March fell to 280 million yuan and 300 million yuan. With the emergence of the increase tide in April and May, the shareholders' announcement of the increase in market value also rose to 350 million yuan and 3.2 billion yuan respectively. As of June 15, shareholders of listed companies have increased a total of about 320 million shares since April, with an increase in market value exceeding 3.5 billion yuan. Behind the surge of the massive increase in May and the retreat of the reduction scale, there is a rare net increase. According to the statistics of our department, in May, shareholders cumulatively announced an increase in market value of nearly 3.2 billion yuan, far exceeding the announced reduction scale of about 1.9 billion yuan in the same period. Wind Information Statistics shows that the last time shareholders of A-share market made a net increase on a monthly basis was in October 2008. In that month, shareholders of listed companies announced an increase in market value of 1.1 billion yuan and an announced reduction in market value of 1 billion yuan. This means that 19 months later, shareholders of the A-share market have again shown a net increase. Moreover, the scale of shareholders' net increase in May this year is more fierce than that when the stock market hit the bottom in October 2008. According to our previous statistics, the increase tide of shareholders of listed companies generally occurs at the stage of market bottoming, such as October 2005 and September 2008. This time, the major shareholders once again promoted a new round of increase tide, which undoubtedly gave investors a ray of hope in the ""bear journey"". Changjiang Electric Power has again become the main target of the increase. The main ""behind the scenes"" behind this round of increase tide is nothing but three main forces, namely, companies, executives and individuals. According to the type of shareholders (companies, executives, individuals) who increase their shares, in the 78 increase announcements released since April, 71 increases came from executives and companies, accounting for 91% of the total. Among them, executives' announcement of share increase reached 46 times, the first place. Many companies have emerged with many executives increasing their shares together. Such as Nantong Technology, Changhang Oil Transport, Liu Huafeng, and so on. There are more than a dozen executives behind them. Among them, the announcement of Changhang Oil Transport's share increase shows that on May 13 and 14, Liu Xihan, the chairman of the company, Zhu Ning, the vice chairman, Li Wanjin, the general manager, and other 13 executives repurchased their own stocks, with a total purchase of about 570000 shares and the transaction price between 5.37 yuan and 5.5 yuan. Liu Huafeng's share increase announcement also shows that on May 13 and 14, Liu Engcheng, the chairman of the company, Tan Yongqiang, the vice chairman and general manager, Su Dongsheng, the director, and other 10 executives purchased about 670000 shares in total. The number of shares increased by each executive of a listed company is mostly less than 100000 shares, and most of them only purchase two or three thousand shares; The chairman of Zongshen Power, the executive with the largest increase in May, Zongshen Zongshen, increased 1 million shares, and the market value of the increase was only 10.15 million yuan. Moreover, all executives' shares increased by only 3.9 million shares, accounting for 1.2% of the total increase since April, and the trend of increasing shares was obviously ""thunderstorm and drizzle"". In contrast with the increase of executives, some ""company"" shareholders are relatively radical. Since April, 16 shareholders who have accumulated shares in the name of ""company"" have increased their shares by 310 million shares, with a total market value of 3.46 billion yuan, accounting for 98% of the total. According to Wind data statistics, the companies that announced to increase their shares in April were Jidong Cement and Zhongxing Commercial, and the companies that announced to increase their shares in May quickly rose to 22, with the largest number of shares being the two companies, Changjiang Electric Power and Guodian Electric Power. The largest shareholder of the former, China Three Gorges Group, announced an increase of more than 100 million shares, with an increase in market value of more than 1.4 billion yuan; The largest shareholder of the latter, China Guodian Group, purchased 81.53 million shares, with an announced increase in market value of 543 million yuan. As the main force of the share increase, Changjiang Electric Power is not the first time to play the role of the monthly share increase champion. In the share increase in January this year, the controlling shareholder of Changjiang Electric Power, China Three Gorges Group, increased more than 100 million shares in the same month, becoming the leading figure of the share increase in January. In the history of the share increase tide, the Group has made many moves to repurchase its own shares on a large scale. Such as the share increase of more than 10 million shares in August 2009 and the share increase of nearly 20 million shares in July 2006. 94% of the shareholders in this round of share increase made profits. Our department has counted the ""bill"" of the shareholders in this round of share increase since April this year, and the results show that most shareholders have received good returns. In the 78 share increase announcements since April, we have eliminated the share increase behavior that actually occurred before the second quarter of this year. Among them, Guodian Power, Hisense Electric and Liu Huafeng, because they implemented the dividend and matching distribution plan after shareholders' share increase, we calculated their account profit and loss according to their matching plan. For other listed companies, we calculated the difference between the average share increase cost of shareholders and the latest share price (the closing price on June 11, the same below). The final calculation results show that 94% of the shares are increased, bringing positive returns to their shareholders. Among the companies that increased their shares in May this year and issued a share increase announcement in May, Qingdao Hisense Electronics, the shareholder of Hisense Electric, made the biggest profit of 26%. In addition, Zhongshen Power, Shanghai Jinling, Nantong Technology and other companies also brought a positive return of more than 10% to their shareholders who increased their holdings."
北京首证：趋势未改变短调必受限⊙北京首证两市昨日惯性低开后均呈遇阻深幅回落态势，大盘还放量击穿了短期均线，行情结束的声音随之也甚嚣尘上。但无论从量价看，还是由热点判断，惯性下探后都很可能会企稳回升，即反弹格局尚未发生逆转，昨日的重挫只是改变了运行速率而已，甚至可能成为缓解“旱情”的一场春雨。趋势未改变短调必受限虽说年线往往会得到格外的关注，沪市近日恰好遇阻于该线，但年线却远没有想象得那么重要，因为沪市已上穿12月线并站上了4季度均线，而深市则在3月便攻克了以日、周、月、季计的所有年线。近日之所以反复，关键就在于近期累计涨幅偏大(两市一个月内分别大涨近21%、27%)，可周阳线实体长度却逐渐缩短，上周五还形成阴吞阳的不良组合，指标也长时间处于高位钝化状态，这就意味着大盘实际已发生了微妙的变化，反复随时都可能会出现，特别是在近期通道上轨附近。但值得注意的，一是中期趋势(即一个多月来的低点连线)并未破坏，该线以日均约11.5点的速度上行，今日约位于2304点；二是此前上攻构成的形态出现上升楔形的诸多迹象，在难以向上拓宽空间时，市场经常就会选择向下回探趋势线的支撑，换言之，回调是修正通道(及指标过高)的需要，原始上升趋势线与3、4月之交反复时的低点以及21日均线等恰好汇聚在2300点上下，短线下探至此企稳回升可能自然就更大些。缩量是正道时势已不同前三周的量能虽持续放大，但无论周还是日成交量都没有改写年内的天量纪录，而周成交额的增幅则从四成多缩减至不足4%，且截至上周，两市自去年10月底以来的总量已高达14.5万亿，即约为2007年10月见顶后下调时总量的一半，短期反复可能自然也会有所加大。不过，这一量能标准实际上是不够的，因为市场的流通市值已经大大增加，绝对成交额以及换手率高低也就不能简单类比。与此相似，所谓前期成交密集区也不足以构成阻力，或者说这种市场压力实际已大大减轻。不仅市场容量已发生重大变化，而且由行情性质看，量能长时间居高不下也并非好事，因为巨量就是多空分歧很大的必然结果，缩量反弹才有利于行情延续得更长。所谓缩量，也绝不是说量能持续萎缩，而是说在某一合适的区间内随大盘涨跌而缩放。简单说，(周)日均成交超过2000亿很可能导致行情提早结束，若低于1500亿，上攻力度则会减弱，即1750亿左右极可能是最有利的。另外笔者认为，蓝筹整体走弱往往难以持续，短期变数因此加大，而这种变数至少是止跌企稳。		正向	"Beijing's first proof: the trend has not changed, and the short adjustment must be restricted ⊙ Beijing's first proof that both cities were惯ual low open yesterday, and then they all encountered deep setbacks. The market also broke through the short moving average, and the voice of the end of the market was very noisy. But whether from the perspective of quantity and price, or from the perspective of hot spots, it is very likely to stabilize and rise after being惯ual to probe, that is, the rebound pattern has not reversed, and yesterday's heavy blow only changed the running speed, or it may become a spring rain to alleviate the ""drought"". The short adjustment must be limited because the trend has not changed. Although the annual line often gets special attention, the Shanghai Stock Exchange has just encountered obstacles on this line in recent days, the annual line is far less important than imagined, because the Shanghai Stock Exchange has passed the December line and stood on the fourth quarter moving average, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange has攻克d all annual lines in months, weeks, months and quarters since March. The reason for the recent repetition is that the cumulative increase in recent days is too large (the two cities soared nearly 21% and 27% respectively within one month), but the length of the positive line of the week is gradually shortened, and the negative line swallowed the positive line last Friday to form a bad combination, and the index has been in a high state for a long time, which means that the market has actually changed subtly, and the repetition may occur at any time, especially in the vicinity of the upper track of the recent channel. However, it is worth noting that the medium-term trend (that is, the connection of more than one month's low points) has not been damaged. The line is rising at a speed of about 11.5 points per day, and today is about 2304 points; Second, the pattern formed by the previous attack shows many signs of a rising wedge shape. When it is difficult to widen space upward, the market often chooses to retreat to the trend line for support. In other words, the correction is necessary to correct the channel (and the index is too high). The original upward trend line, the low point when it was repeated at the junction of March and April, and the 21-day moving average just converge at around 2300 points, so it is more natural for the short line to stabilize and rise here. The so-called previous trading intensive area is also insufficient to constitute resistance, or the market pressure has actually been greatly reduced. The market capacity has changed significantly, and from the nature of the market, the fact that the market has been high for a long time is not a good thing, because huge volume is the inevitable result of a great difference between multiple and empty, and the decline of volume is conducive to the continuation of the market. The so-called shrinking volume does not mean that the volume continues to shrink, but that it can be expanded and contracted with the rise and fall of the market in a suitable interval. In short, (week) daily average trading volume exceeding 200 billion yuan is likely to lead to an early end of the market, and if it is less than 150 billion yuan, the attack will weaken, that is, 17.5 billion yuan is the most favorable. In addition, I think that the overall weakness of blue chips is often unsustainable, and the short-term variable is therefore increased, and this variable is at least to stop the decline and stabilize it."

AC米兰有柄直插心脏的匕首意媒完美领袖1个月后诞生新浪体育讯　AC米兰主场3比0大胜巴勒莫，在进球的卡卡和因扎吉背后，没有人会忽视前两个进球的助攻者——安布罗西尼。mediaset赛后给了安布罗西尼7分，除了称赞他创造一个点球、助攻因扎吉进球外，还特地加了一句：“这样的安布罗西尼已证明了今年6月1日之后他有能力成为一名完美的队长。”马尔蒂尼退役后，安布罗西尼自然而然将从现在的队副升格为第一队长。尴尬的是，安布罗西尼与AC米兰的合同在2010年6月到期，至今米兰俱乐部没有主动提出续约，如果安布罗西尼只剩下一年时间做队长，他自己难以定心，对俱乐部未来更衣室平稳过渡也没有好处。在这个微妙的阶段，安布罗西尼首先用场上表现向俱乐部表明：至少我的竞技状态是可以信任的。安布罗西尼虽已32岁，但在对巴勒莫的比赛中依然像个不知道疲劳为何物的小伙子。三球大胜巴勒莫赢得轻松，关键在于前20分钟的两个进球打垮了对手的士气。安布罗西尼从一开场就进入状态，第6分钟接到贝克汉姆的角球中路冲顶被对方阻挡。第10分钟贝克汉姆长传找因扎吉，巴勒莫后卫解围未出禁区，卡萨尼正等待球从空中落下再次解围，安布罗西尼已抢先一步跃在空中触到球，卡萨尼出脚把安布罗西尼从半空中踢倒，毫无疑问是个犯规动作。主裁判里佐利果断吹罚点球，卡卡为米兰首开纪录。十分钟后诞生了因扎吉的进球，这次配合尤为精彩。安布罗西尼中场左侧将球交给卡卡，随即向禁区内直线插入，卡卡没有停球，顺势搓出挑传，落点与安布罗西尼的跑位完全吻合，安布罗西尼左脚凌空传到后门柱，无人盯防的因扎吉原地将球顶入。这显然是米兰训练中演练过无数遍的成熟套路，三人之间的配合环环相扣，技术方面依赖卡卡的传球脚法，战术上最关键一环就是安布罗西尼坚决的纵向插入。第39分钟安布罗西尼又在左翼拉开空档，第一时间横传给中路的因扎吉，中途被博沃破坏。以安布罗西尼的身体条件从肋部强行直线冲进禁区，几乎没有人能正面阻挡，这种强硬的跑位方式同他的头球优势相似，在AC米兰整体技术化的战术中显得很生硬，但又是必要的元素。有了安布罗西尼的冲击力，AC米兰准确的传球就可以在某个环节撞开缺口，形成直接的打击，有时是通过头球摆渡，有时是通过冲击性的跑位冲开防线。上一轮5比1大胜都灵，安布罗西尼就是通过“蛮不讲理”的纵向冲击力打进一球，还创造一个点球。安布罗西尼的技术特点并不独特，世界上能冲能抢的后腰多的是，但要达到与卡卡等人之间的默契，非一朝一夕之功，就连正值当打之年的弗拉米尼打后腰时也很难起到相同的作用。两场比赛，安布罗西尼创造两个点球，另有一个进球和一次助攻，在续约谈判前充分证明了自身的价值。AC米兰需要清洗的人有很多，但安布罗西尼这样赤胆忠心又有能力的老将无论如何不应该被轻视。(定春)	安布罗西尼,卡萨尼,马尔蒂尼,博沃,卡卡,里佐利,因扎吉,弗拉米尼,贝克汉姆,定春	正向	"AC Milan has a dagger straight into the heart of the Italian media's perfect leader, which was born in a month. Sina Sports News AC Milan beat Palermo 3-0 at home. Behind the goal scorers Kaka and Inzaghi, no one will ignore the assistant of the first two goals - Ambrosini. Mediaset gave Ambrosini 7 points after the game. In addition to praising him for creating a penalty and assisting Inzaghi to score, he added: ""Such Ambrosini has proved that he has the ability to become a perfect captain after June 1, 2006."" After Maldini retired, Ambrosini naturally rose from the current vice captain to the first captain. Embarrassedly, Ambrosini's contract with AC Milan expired in June 2010, and so far, Milan Club has not taken the initiative to renew the contract. If Ambrosini has only one year left to be the captain, he will find it hard to make up his mind, and it will not be good for the club's future dressing room to transition smoothly. At this subtle stage, Ambrosini first showed the club that his competitive status was trustworthy. Although Ambrosini is 32 years old, he is still like a young man who doesn't know what fatigue is in the game against Palermo. Palermo won easily with a big score of three goals. The key is that the two goals in the first 20 minutes broke the morale of the opponent. Ambrosini gets into the state from the beginning. In the 6th minute, Beckham's corner ball was blocked in the middle of the road. In the 10th minute, Beckham looked for Inzaghi with a long pass. Palermo's defender didn't leave the禁区. Casani was waiting for the ball to fall from the air to defuse the siege again. Ambrosini had jumped first in the air to touch the ball. Casani kicked Ambrosini down from the air. There is no doubt that it is a foul action. The referee Rizzoli decisively called a penalty, and Kaka scored the first goal for Milan. Ten minutes later, Inzaghi scored a goal. This cooperation was particularly exciting. Ambrosini handed the ball to Kaka on the left side of the midfield, and then inserted directly into the禁区. Kaka didn't stop the ball. Instead, he rubbed it out and passed it. The landing point was completely in line with Ambrosini's running position. Ambrosini's left foot passed the ball to the latter door post, and the unmarked Inzaghi topped the ball on the spot. This is obviously a mature routine that Milan has practiced countless times in training. The cooperation between the three people is interlinked. Technically, it depends on Kaka's passing skills. The most important link in terms of tactics is Ambrosini's firm vertical insertion. In the 39th minute, Ambrosini opened up space on the left wing again and passed to Inzaghi in the middle of the first time, which was destroyed on the way by Bo Wei. With Ambrosini's physical conditions, it is almost impossible for anyone to stop him from breaking into the prohibition area from the rib in a straight line. This kind of tough running position is similar to his heading advantage. It is very rigid in the overall technical tactics of AC Milan, but it is a necessary element. With the impact of Ambrosini, the accurate pass of AC Milan can open a gap at some links, forming a direct attack. Sometimes it is through a header, and sometimes it is through an impulsive run to open the defense. In the last round, Ambrosini scored a goal with an ""unreasonable"" vertical impact and created a penalty for the 5-1 victory over Turin. Ambrosini's technical characteristics are not unique. There are many tough and tough defensive players in the world, but it is not an overnight success to achieve the tacit understanding between Kaka and others. Even Flamini, who is in his prime, is hard to play the same role when he plays in the back waist. In the two games, Ambrosini created two penalties, another goal and an assist, fully proving his own value before the renewal negotiation. AC Milan needs a lot of people to be cleaned up, but the old and capable players such as Ambrosini should not be underestimated in any case. (Ding Chun)"

九月持续反弹基金悄然减仓券商研究报告显示，超七成基金仓位上周下降8月份A股市场大幅度的急跌，让不少机构投资者的信心跌至谷底，市场情绪转向悲观。不过，9月初以来市场止跌反弹，上证指数反弹幅度超过10%，部分个股甚至反弹幅度超过50%。不过，据记者不完全统计，公募基金正在减仓。有关券商研究报告显示，公募基金9月份以来仓位递减。根据东方证券最新出炉的研究报告显示，尽管近期市场继续反弹，但基金仓位却持续向下，并且创出了近段时间以来仓位降低幅度的新低。报告称，“无论从仓位的绝对数字来看，还是从基金减仓的数量来看，都是清一色的以减仓为主要操作，反映了基金对于市场的态度并不乐观。”报告测算显示，近期北京、深圳、上海三地股票型基金的平均仓位分布比较平均，均在83%左右，较上周仓位出现显著下降，减仓行为比较一致。分基金类型来讲，股票型基金仓位从86.21%降至上周的83.75%，下降2.46个百分点。考虑市场本身的上涨对基金仓位的影响，基金主动减仓比例为2.95%，是近期以来的最大单周仓位。从基金数量上来看，超过七成基金仓位在上周下降，仅有8.7%的基金加仓。事实上，此前不少机构投资者对8月大跌的原因归结为，对前期过快上涨和较高估值的修正，以及对实际经济复苏的质疑。在9月初，不少机构对下半年行情表示悲观，投资仓位果断降低，并注重布局防御性品种。对于市场未来趋势，不少基金认为，虽然最近一阶段市场有所回升，但估计不会持续很久，更多时间内上证指数将在一定区间内做波动，最终的走向还是要取决于10月份开始陆续公布的三季报数据。国泰金马稳健基金经理程洲认为，现在国泰金马的仓位控制在75%左右，比行业水平要略低些，持仓结构偏向防御，虽然这样的配置结构在7月面临了一定压力，但现在回过头来看，防御性的策略还是非常正确的。郑实	郑实,程洲	正向	"The continuous rebound fund in September quietly reduced its position. The securities company's research report showed that more than 70% of the funds' positions fell last week. The sharp decline of A-share market in August let many institutional investors' confidence fall to the bottom, and the market sentiment turned pessimistic. However, since the beginning of September, the market has stopped falling and rebounded, and the Shanghai Stock Index has rebounded by more than 10%, and some stocks have even rebounded by more than 50%. However, according to the journalist's incomplete statistics, public offering funds are reducing their positions. The relevant securities company's research report shows that the public offering fund has been reducing its position since September. According to the latest research report of Orient Securities, although the market continued to rebound recently, the fund position continued to decline, creating a new low of the position reduction in recent days. The report said, ""Whether from the perspective of the absolute number of positions or the number of fund reductions, the main operation is to reduce positions, which reflects that the fund is not optimistic about the market."" The report estimates that the average position of stock funds in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai in recent days is relatively balanced, around 83%, with a significant decrease from last week's position, and the behavior of reducing positions is relatively consistent. In terms of fund types, the position of stock funds fell from 86.21% to 83.75% last week, down 2.46 percentage points. Considering the impact of the market's own rise on the fund position, the fund's active reduction ratio is 2.95%, which is the largest single week position in recent days. In terms of the number of funds, more than 70% of the funds' positions decreased last week, and only 8.7% of the funds added warehouse. In fact, many institutional investors attributed the reason for the sharp decline in August to the correction of the previous rapid growth and high valuation, and the doubt about the actual economic recovery. At the beginning of September, many institutions expressed pessimism about the market in the second half of the year, decisively reduced their investment positions, and focused on defensive varieties. With regard to the future trend of the market, many funds believe that although the market has rebounded in the recent stage, it is estimated that it will not last long. More time will be spent on the Shanghai Stock Index to fluctuate within a certain range, and the final trend will still depend on the three quarterly reports to be published in succession from October. Cheng Zhou, the manager of the stable fund of Guotai Jinniu, believes that the position of Guotai Jinniu is now controlled at about 75%, slightly lower than the industry level, and the position structure tends to be defensive. Although this configuration structure faced some pressure in July, looking back now, the defensive strategy is still very correct. Zheng Shi"

The once Haishulong of Guocheng Investment [macro trend judgment] On Wednesday, the stock index opened low and once broke through the 30 day moving average, triggering the market's expectation of a turnaround in the market. However, the stock index slowly fell back near the close. Recently, the initial value of HSBC PMI has returned to above 50, and the CPI has declined for two consecutive months, which has reduced the market's concerns about the hard landing of the Chinese economy and inflation. In particular, the moderate fine tuning mentioned by Premier Wen has triggered the market's expectation of monetary policy easing, which has let the market shout a chorus of reversals. In a state of confusion, some investors began to get feverish again. Market risks often arise in this way. The stock index took the opportunity to reflect the market's impetuous mentality. When the housing price and the economic slowdown have basically taken shape but have not yet shown up, the stock index still has no foundation for bottoming out. The rebound is just a process of changing the position of the trapped chips. The continuous sharp rise has brought good opportunities for the overweight to reduce their positions. It is better to change their positions, withdraw and have a rest? On the whole, the willingness of the market to do more has not disappeared, and it is expected that the market will continue to extend the volatile rebound in the short term. However, with the continuous climb of height, the upward strength will also slow down, and then the risk of rising will gradually appear. There are still some individual stocks on the market that remain active. However, it is also difficult to make a single sided upward V shaped reversal in the short term, and there are bound to be repeated events in the future. The most important risk of declining performance of listed companies, the evolution of domestic and foreign debt risks, and the stock market's expansion pace still remain unchanged, and there are signs of escalation, so investors should always keep prudent strategies in the market! 【Macro Focus】 1. The summit of 27 EU member states reached an agreement on bank capital restructuring. On October 26, London (October 27, Beijing time), today's EU summit reached an agreement on the bank capital restructuring plan, and the financial aid capital package may grow to a scale of 1 trillion euros. 【Comment】 The summit of 27 EU member states reached an agreement, easing the current tense situation of the European debt crisis, which has an important impact on stabilizing the global stock market. However, it remains to be seen whether the meeting can completely solve the hidden dangers of the European debt crisis. 2. Zhou Xiaochuan: The monetary policy always remains unchanged. On October 26, the People's Bank of China (central bank) reported that Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank's governor, recently said that the central bank is very closely following the inflation level, and will not ignore inflation in order to focus on economic growth. At present, the keynote of monetary policy in China remains unchanged, while maintaining sufficient flexibility and targeting. 【Comment】 From the statement of Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, it can be seen that the monetary policy is still difficult to change under the current economic situation. For A-shares, the bottom of technology and macro aspects is hidden, and the monetary policy bottom has not yet appeared. 3. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will formulate measures to guide the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. Recently, the problem of difficulties in the production and operation of small and medium-sized enterprises has received attention from all sides. In this regard, Zheng Xin, Director of the Department of Small and Medium Enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference held by the State Council Information Office yesterday that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is formulating policy measures to help small and medium-sized enterprises get rid of the dilemma. 【Comment】 The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will formulate measures to guide the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, which will have a positive impact on small and medium-sized enterprises. A-share related listed companies are expected to benefit from the current trading opportunities. 4. The State Council will pilot value-added tax reform in Shanghai next year. Premier Wen Jiabao of the State Council presided over the executive meeting of the State Council on the 26th to decide on the pilot reform of deepening the value-added tax system. The meeting decided that the pilot project would first focus on transportation and some modern service industries in Shanghai. At the same time, two new low rates of 11% and 6% were added on the basis of the existing value-added tax standard rate of 17% and the low rate of 13% [Comment] This reform will change the problem of excessive tax burden and repeated collection caused by the collection of business tax in the service industry, reduce the tax burden of enterprises, and means that the modern service industry led by the transportation industry is expected to enter the era of comprehensive tax reduction. The implementation of the reform is conducive to the rise of the consumer goods industry, providing assistance for the transformation of the economy. The relevant service industry of A-shares is expected to benefit in the long term. 5. Bohai Rim thermal coal prices rose for eight consecutive weeks. On October 26, the average price of 5500 kilocalorie thermal coal in the port of Bohai Rim was reported to close at 853 yuan/ton, rising for eight consecutive weeks, with a cumulative increase of 28 yuan/ton. At the same time, the purchase price of key power plants in East China has also risen for four consecutive weeks. 【Comment】 Although the port coal price continues to rise, the future thermal coal price will weaken as the industry is in a situation of having a price but no market. Nevertheless, the rise of coal prices is helpful to the short-term rebound of coal stocks. 【Global Finance】 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 11867.98 points, up 1.38%; The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 2650.67 points, up 0.46%; The S & P 500 Index closed at 1242.00 points, up 1.05%.

电视收视率发现造假行为缺乏第三方监督所致风险低、方式隐秘、惩戒机制缺失惟收视率与恶性竞争是主要诱因缺乏第三方监督让造假有机可乘本报北京6月30日电(记者曹玲娟、刘阳)收视率造假正在成为个别地方卫视争夺市场的“捷径”。本报记者近日在采访中获悉，与制作节目相比，“制作”收视率以其低廉的代价、隐秘且难以查证的造假方式，以及惩戒机制缺失的行业背景，正在成为个别地方卫视在激烈的市场竞争中力争上游的“幕后法宝”。据介绍，目前我国电视收视率最为可靠的统计方法是，在样本客户家庭电视机上加装类似机顶盒的收视测量仪。样本户家庭成员在收看电视时，只要在某个频道停留一定时间长度，机顶盒就会记录，生成统计数据。自2008年底全球知名调查机构尼尔森结束在中国市场的收视率调查业务以来，目前全国各电视台各大城市的所有收视率，基本由央视—索福瑞媒介研究有限公司一家出具。业内人士介绍，“收视率”作为当前全世界电视行业中的“通用货币”，由市场普遍认可的一家调查机构提供调查数据，有利于行业标准的统一和管理的规范化。然而，在这种“一家独大”的前提下，与其他国家相比，我国收视率调查过程中缺乏来自第三方的监督与相应管理惩戒机制，则为收视率造假减少了风险成本，人为操控索福瑞的样本户、“改写”收视率数据的现象已经发生。以索福瑞在某一线城市为例。据了解，该城市常住人口过千万，目前约有不到500户安装收视测量仪为索福瑞提供测量数据。由于外地卫视在该地区的收视率并不高，当地研究机构认为，一家卫视全天的收视率常态，约在0.2至0.3之间。但一些专业人士日前在分析收视数据时发现了一些不正常的收视现象。以全国部分收视测量仪城市数据为例，今年全国两会闭幕后的总理记者见面会，全国所有卫视同时直播，但某沿海地区的省级卫视收视率比其他卫视高1倍以上；玉树地震哀悼日晚上，由央视新闻频道制作的节目要求省级卫视转播，该卫视的收视率也高于央视新闻频道本身。相关人员根据测算，有些城市，只要有一户样本户，能成功提交全家全天看某特定卫视的数据，该卫视的数据就能一下子上升到0.3至0.5左右，几乎翻一倍。异动现象引起了部分电视研究机构的注意。而在之后的收视数据分析中，他们更发现确有个别电视台涉嫌行贿样本。某直辖市一位周姓出租车司机家中，在去年春季时装了一台索福瑞的测量仪。刚装完测量仪一个月左右，就有人来敲门，声称如果他们看某一卫视台节目，就会每个月得到200元的费用，且每周还会有小礼品，逢年过节还会有人登门来送大礼包。此后，收视调查机构进行现场查实确有贿赂。目前该样本户已被撤销。去年一家城市电视台向收视调查机构一次提交关于9户样本户收视率异动的怀疑，经查实，这9户样本户有6户大部分莫名长期锁定一家卫视。撤销后，该卫视在该城市的收视率即刻下降。样本污染的情况并非只存在于特定一线城市。在西安市中级人民法院向媒体公布的“2009年西安十大知识产权案”中，第十例案件便与此有关：一名索福瑞的技术维护人员王某，涉嫌与西安电视台李某、电视短剧制作人张某等人收买相关样本户，被西安市检察院起诉一审，其中王某被判有期徒刑一年零三个月，并处罚金2万元。全国多地也曾出现过收视数据异常。有数据显示，某卫视在其省会城市，黄金时段收视率远远超过其他卫视，甚至达到2.6倍有余；不止一家在全国排名靠前的卫视，在去年10月这段时间内，在该省会城市，出现无规律、多时段、零收视情况。据了解，某些卫视一年以数千万元请民营品牌推广公司进行所谓的品牌推广，而这些经费其实相当部分被用于对收视样本户的干扰造假。根据相关“污染样本”提供的信息，样本被干扰的方式比较隐蔽，多是采用定期给样本用户送大米、食用油之类的小恩小惠，让对方长期锁定该频道。	张某,李某,刘阳,曹玲娟,王某,周某	负向	"The discovery of television ratings fraud caused by the lack of third party supervision caused low risk, secret methods, and the lack of punishment mechanism. The only ratings and恶性competition are the main causes. The lack of third party supervision makes it possible to fake. The Beijing, June 30 (Reporter Cao Lingjuan, Liu Yang) ratings fraud is becoming a ""shortcut"" for some local satellite TV stations to compete for the market. The reporter recently learned in an interview that, compared with the production of programs, ""producing"" ratings is becoming a ""behind the scenes magic weapon"" for some local satellite TV stations to strive for the top in the fierce market competition with its low cost, secret and hard to verify fraud methods, and the industry background of the lack of punishment mechanism. It is reported that the most reliable statistical method of TV ratings in China is to install a set top box like TV meter on the TV set of the sample customer's family. When the family members of the sample household watch TV, if they stay for a certain length of time on a channel, the set top box will record and generate statistical data. Since the end of 2008, when Nielsen, a world famous survey institution, ended its rating survey business in the Chinese market, all ratings of major cities in TV stations across the country have basically been issued by CTV-Sofre Media Research Co., Ltd. Industry insiders introduced that ""ratings"" is the ""common currency"" in the current global television industry. The investigation data provided by a survey organization recognized by the market is conducive to the unification of industry standards and the standardization of management. However, under the premise of ""mono dominant"", the lack of supervision and corresponding management punishment mechanism from the third party in the process of TV rating survey in China, compared with other countries, reduces the risk cost of TV rating fraud and the phenomenon of human manipulation of Sofre's sample households and ""rewriting"" TV rating data has occurred. Take Sofre in a first tier city as an example. It is understood that the permanent population of the city exceeds 10 million, and there are nearly 500 households that have installed TV measurement instruments to provide measurement data for Sofre. Since the ratings of foreign satellite TV stations in this region are not high, local research institutions believe that the ratings of a satellite TV station throughout the day are normal, between 0.2 and 0.3. But some professionals recently found some abnormal viewing phenomena when analyzing viewing data. Taking the data of some urban measurement instruments in China as an example, after the closing of this year's two sessions of the National People's Congress, the prime minister's press conference was simulcast by all satellite TV stations across the country, but the ratings of a provincial satellite TV station in a coastal area were more than twice as high as those of other satellite TV stations; On the evening of the Jade Tree Earthquake Mourning Day, the program produced by CCTV News Channel required provincial satellite TV stations to relay it, and the ratings of the satellite TV station were also higher than those of CCTV News Channel itself. According to the calculation of relevant personnel, in some cities, as long as a sample household can successfully submit the data of the whole family to watch a specific satellite TV station all day long, the data of the satellite TV station can jump up to 0.3 to 0.5, almost doubling. The abnormal phenomenon has attracted the attention of some television research institutions. In the subsequent ratings data analysis, they found that there were indeed some television stations suspected of bribing samples. A taxi driver surnamed Zhou in a municipality directly under the central government had a Sofre measurement instrument installed in his home last spring. Just about a month after the measurement instrument was installed, someone came to knock on the door, saying that if they watched a certain satellite television program, they would get 200 yuan per month, and there would be small gifts every week. Someone would come to give gifts during the festival. Later, the ratings survey organization found out that there was indeed bribery. At present, the sample household has been revoked. Last year, a city television station submitted to the television rating survey organization once a suspicion about the abnormal change of the ratings of 9 sample households. After investigation, six of the nine sample households mostly locked one satellite television station for a long time and inexplicably. After revocation, the ratings of the satellite TV station in the city immediately dropped. The situation of sample pollution is not confined to specific first tier cities. In the ""top ten intellectual property cases in Xi'an in 2009"" published by the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court to the media, the tenth case was related to this: Wang, a technical maintenance worker of Sofre, was suspected of buying relevant samples from Li, a technical maintenance worker of Xi'an TV station, Zhang, a producer of TV short dramas, and others, and was sued by the Xi'an procuratorate. Wang was sentenced to one year and three months' imprisonment and fined 20000 yuan. Abnormal ratings data has also occurred in many parts of the country. Data shows that in the provincial capital city of a satellite TV station, the prime time ratings far exceeded other satellite TV stations, even more than 2.6 times; More than one satellite TV station ranked first in China has shown irregular, multi time and zero ratings in the provincial capital city during this period in October last year. It is understood that some satellite TV stations invite private brand promotion companies to carry out so-called brand promotion for tens of millions of yuan a year, and in fact, a considerable part of these funds is used to interfere with the falsification of TV audience samples. According to the information provided by the relevant ""polluted samples"", the way of interfering with the samples is quite隐蔽, mostly by giving small favors such as rice and cooking oil to the sample users on a regular basis, so that the other party can lock the channel for a long time."
12星座爱情事业一周忠告(组图)作者/萧笑笑本文根据“每周行星预报”撰写而成，更多知识请进入星象学研究室认识我们的内在白羊：危机是奇迹的表达方式之一显然，白羊正在成为最受瞩目的区域。太阳、水星、木星和天王按照约定聚首于此，下周六火星也将加入。按照地球居民的平均寿命，人类一辈子当中只有一次机会见识如斯奇迹。我犹豫了几分钟后，还是决定使用“奇迹”这个词汇。自从日本大地震后，核辐射以及核辐射话题像细菌一样扩散到世俗生活的层面，各种复杂的情绪和反应从不见日光的暗处奔流而出。人们或者恐慌自身安全受到威胁，或者巴不得一起毁灭，或者相对平静地伺候想像中的生死。和谐富裕的科技年代里出生并成长的灵魂从未如此近距离直面物种灭亡危机，尤其该物种涉及人。这不是科幻电影，亲爱的，这是奇迹。我没有丝毫嘲讽或仇视的意思，而是深切感觉人心的麻木、冷酷和僵硬已经到达饱和的临界点，除了物极必反以外似无任何可能性。诚然，不是每一个人都能跳脱肉眼所局限的意象而直接通达无限循环。无限循环跟所谓的完结是两码事。白羊象征纯真的新生，也象征脑细胞革命。它经常被我们比喻为战士，但是，战士并不能覆盖它庞大而丰富的内蕴。换句话说，某种肤浅的程度上白羊可以充当战士，其本质却绝非战士。因为战士是有限的。它是奇迹本身。相对而言，双鱼意指穷途末路。“穷则变，变则通，通则久”的“变”是白羊。也许我们很难理解这句话。或者尝试一下打比方吧，譬如母亲第一次感受胎儿的动态，譬如男人和女人之间的理解，譬如美丽风景给我们留下深刻印象，譬如小动物对我们无偿的报答。甚至路边的树枝吐露新芽亦相当令人震撼。这些都是生命的真实意图。生命的真实意图就是奇迹。灾难不过是其中一种现象，类似函数值。而灾难之所以为灾难，因为我们将之定义为灾难。财运：带着负面能量求财，财就算到手也不如意，正面能量才是求财得财的保障白羊座一周金句：接受全部事实，惟有接受，才能流露真心。财运方面，现在是四星齐聚命宫了，且颗颗强悍，银两更是哗啦啦地往外流，部分人要留神合作事宜的财务环节，慎防对方小人心肠私吞；投资运方面，周五之前盈利形势看好，可以把握则把握，不可以把握则笑看风云。事业方面，凌乱的行星冲击暂时结束了，木星却终于拱破土壤冒头，或许这是今年第一缕关于改变现状的硝烟。之所以说是硝烟，因为不少人将在未来三周好似病急乱投医地想跳到一份新工作上，脑袋发热全然没有发觉。不过毕竟到了白羊月，机遇比之前增多，有待细心挑拣。感情方面，单身族对自己有一定了解，但也未必像自己认知的那样了解得很多，许多时候还得通过他人照见自己；已有伴儿的正跟现实或自己拔河，不过赢输都在一个念头里。贵人星座：射手座小心的星座：巨蟹座巨蟹座一周金句：永远不要幻想自己的梦想能跟他人一起完成。财运方面，上半周天王让你花钱花得畅快，下半周冥王让你花钱花得扭捏甚至不花钱了；投资运方面，周五以前亏的比赚的多，将期望值适当调低会更好。事业方面，土星对冲便是最直接的压力，压力源却是大环境下人人都想做得更好或革旧变新方便竞争。你十分忙碌，是表象；你是竞争体系里面的一棵螺丝钉，是本质。你若觉得累，绝对不是因为活计多，而是竞争必然让人疲倦。感情方面，单身族自恋得彻底些会没那么烦恼，烦恼都是自己搞不清楚自己的情感和情绪因何而生；小两口不要妄想自己能改变对方，哪怕改变一点儿都是不切实际的。贵人星座：摩羯座小心的星座：射手座处女座一周金句：心理依赖不是合作。把两个个体揉成一个个体不是合作。内心独立才是合作的基础。因为每个个体都只能为自己负责。财运方面，木星咆哮着冲向财帛宫了，大概未来三周都是非常容易破财的，但是不要紧，你的收入是有保证的；投资运方面，众多行星沸腾在此处，大起大落的幅度很大，所谓天威难测也。事业方面，人总是时不时遇见干扰题，上周题型刚答完，这周又出现新题型，题目们本意不是难倒你，而是要求你进一步回答——如何整合既得资源以便为自己的目标服务。也许这么说有点儿抽象，不过该效应持续三周，慢慢地会明白过来。感情方面，单身族的某些活结可能瞬间解开，也许得益于地球本身的转变，你想通的也正是别人想通的，尽管某些死结依然凝固；两口子看向未来总比回望过去好。贵人星座：狮子座小心的星座：天秤座射手座一周金句：缺乏名气的人，一般会期盼名气；有了点儿名气的人，一般会期盼更多名气。对名气的渴求，表面上被我们当作“可以赚钱”的借口。但是，真实的出发点却是——害怕无法生存。财运方面，木星对财帛宫一点儿都不客气，开始掠夺无数财宝了，因而你会破财，生存不仅仅是赚钱和省钱，还包括了很大程度的出钱；投资运方面，上半周比下半周更能招徕财气。事业方面，虽然行星们没有自动排列到最显著的方位上，可是土星已经对你的精神产生影响，它既是现实残酷的折射又是理智周全的培育，所以你不会像之前那样浮躁或焦虑，就好像尘埃落定或一切都定型后的行动，显得沉稳而不遗余力。感情方面，单身族已经积累足够的资粮培植桃花了，不用刻意放电也能遇见对自己有意的人；恋情男女上周为小事意见不合的情况过去了，本周想的是大事而非鸡毛蒜皮。贵人星座：金牛座小心的星座：处女座		正向	"The author/Xiao Laughter This article was written based on the ""weekly planet forecast"". More knowledge can be found in the astrology research room to get to know our inner Aries: Crisis is one of the expressions of miracle, obviously, Aries is becoming the most prominent area. The sun, Mercury, Jupiter and Uranus have gathered here as agreed, and Mars will also join next Saturday. According to the average life span of earth's residents, humans have only one chance in their lifetime to witness such a miracle. After hesitating for a few minutes, I still decided to use the word ""miracle"". Since the Japanese earthquake, nuclear radiation and the topic of nuclear radiation have spread to the level of secular life like bacteria, and various complex emotions and reactions gush out from the dark place where they have never seen the sun. People either panic that their safety is threatened, or they would rather die together, or they serve the imagined life and death relatively peacefully. The soul born and growing in the era of harmonious wealth and technology has never faced the crisis of species extinction so closely, especially when it involves people. This is not a science fiction movie, dear, it's a miracle. I have no intention of mocking or hating, but I deeply feel that the numbness, cruelty and stiffness of people's hearts have reached the critical point of saturation, and there seems to be no possibility except that things must go to extremes. Indeed, not everyone can directly reach the infinite cycle beyond the image limited by the naked eye. Infinity cycle is quite different from the so-called ending. Aries symbolizes the pure new life, as well as the revolution of brain cells. It is often described by us as a warrior, but the warrior does not cover its huge and rich connotation. In other words, to a certain superficial degree, Aries can act as a warrior, but its essence is by no means a warrior. Because warriors are limited. It is a miracle in itself. By contrast, Pisces means a dead end. ""Poor then change, change then pass, pass then pass"" is Aries. Perhaps we find it hard to understand this sentence. Or try to give an analogy, such as a mother's first feeling of the fetus's dynamics, such as the understanding between men and women, such as the beautiful scenery that leaves a deep impression on us, and such as the free reward of small animals to us. Even the branches on the roadside can also spit out new buds, which is quite shocking. These are the true intentions of life. The true intention of life is a miracle. Disasters are just one of the phenomena, similar to function values. And the reason why disasters are disasters is that we define them as disasters. Financial fortune: When you seek wealth with negative energy, even if you get it, it will not be as good as you wish. Positive energy is the guarantee of wealth. Aries' golden sentence for a week: Accept all the facts. Only by accepting them can you show your true heart. In terms of wealth, it is now a gathering of four stars in the life palace, and each of them is so strong that silver is flowing out and some people should pay attention to the financial aspects of cooperation, and be careful that the other party may swallow with a small heart; In terms of investment, the profit situation is promising before Friday, so you can grasp it or laugh at the clouds if you can't. In terms of career, the chaos of the planet impact has temporarily ended, but Jupiter has finally broken through the soil, which may be the first smoke of this year about changing the status quo. It is called ""smoke"" because many people will want to jump to a new job in the next three weeks, as if they were in a hurry to get sick. However, after all, it is April, with more opportunities and waiting for careful selection. In terms of feelings, the single race has a certain understanding of themselves, but they may not necessarily know much about themselves. Many times, they have to see themselves through others; The partner who already has a partner is wrestling with reality or himself, but the win or loss is in one thought. Lucky constellation: Sagittarius Constellation: Cancer Constellation Cancer's golden sentence for a week: Never imagine that you can complete your dreams with others. In terms of wealth, Uranus makes you spend money happily in the first half of the week, and Pluto makes you spend money reluctantly or not at all in the second half of the week; In terms of investment, the loss is more than the profit before Friday, and it is better to adjust the expectation value appropriately. In terms of career, the most direct pressure is the opposition of Saturn, and the pressure source is that everyone wants to do better or innovate in the context of the macro environment to facilitate competition. You are very busy, which is an appearance; You are a screw in the competitive system, which is essential. If you feel tired, it is not because you have a lot of jobs, but because competition must make people tired. In terms of feelings, single people will be less troubled if they are completely narcissistic. Troubles all come from their own confusion about their emotions and emotions; Don't imagine that you can change the other party, even if it's a bit unrealistic. Lucky constellation: Capricorn Constellation: Sagittarius Constellation Virgo's golden sentence for a week: Psychological dependence is not cooperation. It's not cooperation to knead two individuals into one. Inner independence is the basis of cooperation. Because each individual can only be responsible for himself. In terms of wealth, Jupiter roared to the palace of wealth, and it was very easy to break the fortune in the coming three weeks, but it doesn't matter, your income is guaranteed; In terms of investment, many planets are boiling here, with a large fluctuation, which is called ""hard to measure"". In terms of career, people always meet interference problems from time to time. Last week's problem type has just been answered, and this week a new problem type has appeared. The purpose of the problem is not to make you difficult, but to ask you to further answer - how to integrate the existing resources in order to serve your own goals. Maybe it's a bit abstract to say so, but the effect will last for three weeks, and slowly, you will understand. In terms of feelings, some of the live knots of single people may be instantly untied, which may benefit from the transformation of the earth itself. What you understand is what others understand, although some dead knots are still solidified; It's better for couples to look to the future than to look back. Lucky constellation: Leo Constellation: Libra Constellation Sagittarius' golden sentence for a week: People who lack fame usually look forward to fame; Those who have some fame usually look forward to more fame. The thirst for fame is, on the surface, used by us as an excuse to ""make money"". However, the real starting point is - fear of being unable to survive. In terms of wealth, Jupiter is not rude to the palace of wealth. It has begun to plunder countless treasures, so you will lose money. Survival is not only to make money and save money, but also to pay money to a large extent; In terms of investment, the first half of the week is more likely to attract wealth than the second half of the week. In terms of career, although the planets have not automatically arranged to the most significant position, Saturn has affected your spirit, which is both a reflection of the cruel reality and a cultivation of reason, so you will not be as impetuous or anxious as before. It's like an action after the dust has settled or everything has taken shape, which seems stable and sparing no effort. In terms of feelings, single people have accumulated enough food to cultivate peach blossom, so they don't have to give off electricity intentionally to meet people who are interested in themselves; The situation that the couple disagreed on small things last week has passed. This week, they think about major events rather than trivial matters. Lucky constellation: Taurus Constellation: Virgo"
黑狗4年间接送小主人走山路上学一条普通的黑狗，4年间，每天早上护送小主人走山路去上学，晚上又按时等候在学校门口，护送小主人回家。一条狗与一个小学生相伴而行成为了偏僻大山中一道动人的风景。8月19日，崇义县文英乡古选村村民廖谨平告诉记者，他女儿廖春从上小学二年级开始，就由家里的黑狗每天护送上学放学，一直到廖春上六年级大黑狗病死为止。现在那条黑狗的孩子——小黑狗，又开始“接班”，继续做起了廖春的保镖。廖谨平家单独住在村里的一座山上，女儿每天上学需要走2个小时。由于去学校的山路很偏僻，两边都是高山密林，7岁的女儿上一年级时，一直由廖谨平接送，有时家里养的黑狗也会跟着去。廖春上二年级时，有一天放学后发现自己家的大黑早已等在了学校门口。廖谨平也发现每天吃完中饭后大黑就不知去向，原来它是去学校接小主人去了。就这样，大黑承担起接送廖春上学的任务，一晃就是4年，从未间断。去年的一天，廖春上学途中突然遇到一条蛇，大黑“嗖”地扑上去就和蛇斗了起来，最终蛇被咬死，大黑的腿也被蛇咬伤。大黑受伤后还是安全地把廖春送到了学校。回忆起与大黑在一起的日子，廖春记忆犹新地说，大黑很强壮，有它陪伴，走山路不仅不害怕了，还很有趣。有时候，走在路上她会把书包挂在大黑身上，大黑俨然成了一个顽皮的小书僮。去年12月，不幸的事发生了。大黑突然失去了往日的风采，躺在地上无精打采，病了。虽然经过主人精心的护理和医治，它还是告别了主人一家和自己的岗位。廖谨平妻子说，那条狗真有灵性，是一条好狗，这4年它为我们奉献了很多很多。它死的时候，我们都很伤心，廖春哭了整整一天。为了让它离我们近点，我们把它埋在了房子边上。如今，大黑的“儿子”——小黑，每天也按时接送廖春上学和回家。本报记者杜金存实习生秦宏	秦宏,杜金存,廖春,廖谨平	正向	"A common black dog, for four years, accompanied the little master to go to school on the mountain road every morning and waited on time at the school gate in the evening to accompany the little master home. A dog and a primary school student walking together became a moving scenery in the remote mountains. On August 19, Liao Jinping, a villager of Guxuan Village, Wenying Town, Chongyi County, told the reporter that his daughter Liao Chun was accompanied by the family's black dog to go to school and get off work from the second grade of primary school until the big black dog died when Liao Chun was in the sixth grade. Now the child of the black dog - the little black dog - has begun to ""take over"" and continue to serve as Liao Chun's bodyguard. Liao Jinping's family lives alone on a mountain in the village, and his daughter needs to walk for 2 hours every day to go to school. Because the mountain road to the school is very remote, with high mountains and dense forests on both sides, Liu Jinping has been picking up and dropping off his 7-year-old daughter when she was in the first grade. When Liao Chun was in the second grade, one day after school, she found that her big black dog had been waiting at the school gate. Liao Jinping also found that Dabai disappeared after lunch every day. It turned out that he was going to school to pick up the little master. In this way, the big black took on the task of picking up Liao Chun to go to school. It was four years in a flash, and it never stopped. One day last year, Liao Chun suddenly met a snake on his way to school. Dabai suddenly pounced on it and fought with the snake. In the end, the snake was bitten to death and Dabai's leg was also bitten by the snake. Dabai still safely sent Liao Chun to school after he was injured. When recalling the days with Dabai, Liao Chun still remembered that Dabai was very strong. With him, it was not only scary but also interesting to walk on the mountain road. Sometimes, she would hang her schoolbag on Dabai when she was walking on the road, and Dabai became a naughty little book boy. In December last year, an unfortunate thing happened. Dabai suddenly lost his former风采and lay on the ground listless and sick. Although the owner carefully nursed and treated him, he still bid farewell to the owner and his post. Liao Jinping's wife said that the dog was really spiritual. It was a good dog. In the past four years, it has made a lot of contributions to us. When it died, we were all sad. Liao Chun cried for a whole day. In order to get closer to us, we buried it beside the house. Nowadays, the ""son"" of Dabai - Xiao Hei - also picks up and drops off Liao Chun on time every day.

陈金夺冠奖金预计达30万球队沾光有望获不菲赞助前晚，江苏羽毛球选手陈金历史性地拿到了世锦赛男单的金牌，江苏再次掀起一股羽毛球热。前不久，江苏羽毛球俱乐部曾一度为赞助问题而发愁，因为缺钱，俱乐部甚至产生过把陈金卖掉的念头。陈金在世锦赛上夺冠后，不少商家又重新关注起羽毛球项目。昨日，有一个企业家主动来到快报，明确表示想赞助江苏羽毛球队，希望快报牵头促成此事。当记者把这一消息转达给江苏羽毛球队总教练孙志安后，孙教练兴奋地表态，“如果真有赞助，那么我们肯定要把陈金留住。”国家省里都要奖赞助商明确奖10万随着陈金在世锦赛上夺冠，这些天，在南京，谈论羽毛球的多了，下关体校羽毛球房里更是热火朝天，所有业余球员见到陈金老爸金超，都会对他竖起大拇指，老金笑在脸上，喜在心里。大伙甚至争着要老金请吃饭，老金都会笑着答应。为了不影响儿子休息，老金没有过多打扰儿子，倒是老金的一帮朋友，争着发消息给陈金，向他道喜，懂事的陈金都会一一回复，丝毫没有明星的架子，“等陈金回来，我们一定要好好为他庆功。”老金的朋友杨总激动地告诉记者。时隔11年，南京才诞生这么一个含金量相当高的男单金牌，大家自然非常激动。市里区里的贺信不断。这一次，世锦赛夺冠，国家方面肯定要对陈金进行奖励，具体奖励多少，目前还没有明确的数字，不过，江苏队的教练说，按照以往的惯例，可能会奖励10万元，同时省里也会对陈金进行奖励，与国家标准一样。除此以外，中国羽毛球队的赞助商也明确表示，要给陈金奖10万。陈金表现好有赞助商找上门了前段时间，江苏羽毛球队总教练孙志安一直在为江苏羽毛球俱乐部的赞助问题发愁，他曾经设想，一旦赞助经费不足，希望把陈金卖掉，一来可以多一点运营经费，二来也给其他年轻队员一些机会。不过，随着陈金、蔡?在世锦赛上收获冠军，江苏众将在世锦赛上的精彩表现，让羽毛球的热度再一次在江苏升温，目前已经有企业主动找上门了，他们希望能与江苏羽毛球队进行深度合作。尽管只是意向，还没有最后签约，但这已经让江苏羽毛球队看到了一丝希望，一旦赞助经费到位，那么江苏队也就不用再为卖不卖陈金的问题发愁了，“如果有足够的赞助费，那么我们肯定会把陈金留在队中，谁也不想这么做的，很多时候也是一种无奈。”孙志安告诉记者。去年由于经费不足，江苏羽毛球俱乐部在羽毛球超级联赛中表现一般，未能闯进决赛，事实上，按照江苏队的实力，如果俱乐部有充足的运作资金，那么进决赛甚至夺冠都不是什么难事。下月回江苏期待新老冠军聚会刚刚打完世锦赛，陈金却闲不下来，他将从巴黎直接回北京，继续参加训练。因为接下来，他还需要备战全国锦标赛，以及下月中旬在江苏常州举行的羽毛球大师赛。“大师赛10号开始，在常州，到时候我肯定要去看看儿子，因为在这之前他肯定没时间回南京。”陈金老爸金超告诉记者。事实上，对于后辈陈金，南京羽毛球队的一些老前辈也非常关心，老一辈羽毛球世界冠军杨阳因为前晚看不到比赛直播，而专门打电话询问陈金老爸，怎么样才能看到，陈金拿到冠军，杨阳也为他感到高兴。事实上，老金有个想法，就是希望陈金回来，能和南京这些冠军前辈聚一聚，“杨阳、孙俊请他们来聚聚没什么问题，就怕陈金没时间回南京。”老金告诉记者。的确，除了比赛，陈金常年都在国家队集训，不知道这次回常州，距离南京这么近，陈金能否抽出一点时间，回家乡南京看看。快报记者吕远	杨阳,杨总,孙俊,蔡,陈金,金超,吕远,孙志安	正向	"Chen Jin's championship bonus is expected to reach 3000000. The team benefits from the hope of getting a considerable sponsorship. The night before last, Chen Jin, a badminton player from Jiangsu, won the gold medal of the men's singles championship in the world championship, and Jiangsu once again set off a badminton craze. Not long ago, Jiangsu Badminton Club was once worried about sponsorship because of lack of money, and the club even had the idea of selling Chen Jin. After Chen Jin won the championship in the World Championships, many businessmen have reintegrated the badminton project. Yesterday, an entrepreneur came to the Express News on his own initiative and clearly expressed his willingness to sponsor the Jiangsu Badminton Team, hoping that the Express News would take the lead in promoting this event. When the reporter passed the news to Sun Zhi'an, the head coach of Jiangsu Badminton Team, Sun Coach excitedly said, ""If there is really a sponsor, we will definitely keep Chen Jin."" The national province also rewards the sponsors with a clear award of 100000. With Chen Jin's championship in the World Championships, these days, there are more people in Nanjing talking about badminton. The badminton room of the Badminton School in Xiamen is even more popular. All the amateur players will give his father Jin Chao a thumbs up when they see Chen Jin's father Jin Chao, and the old man smiles on his face and rejoices in his heart. Everyone even competed to invite the old gold to dinner, and the old gold would agree with a smile. In order not to affect his son's rest, the old man did not disturb his son too much. Instead, a group of friends of the old man competed to send messages to Chen Jin to congratulate him. Chen Jin, who is sensible, will reply one by one, and he has no celebrity style. ""When Chen Jin comes back, we must give him a credit."" President Yang, a friend of the old man, told the reporter excitedly. It was 11 years later that Nanjing was born with a men's singles gold medal of considerable gold content, so everyone was naturally very excited. The congratulatory letters from the city and the district are endless. This time, the World Championships won the championship. The state must reward Chen Jin. The specific amount of reward is not yet clear. However, the coach of Jiangsu team said that according to the past practice, the reward may be 100000 yuan, and the province will also reward Chen Jin, which is the same as the national standard. In addition, the sponsor of the Chinese badminton team has also made it clear that it will give Chen Jin a 100000 prize. Chen Jin has a sponsor who is looking for him. Some time ago, Sun Zhi'an, the head coach of Jiangsu Badminton Team, was worried about the sponsorship of Jiangsu Badminton Club. He once thought that once the sponsorship funds were insufficient, he hoped to sell Chen Jin, which would not only give more operational funds, but also give some opportunities to other young players. However, with Chen Jin and Cai? With the victory of the World Championships, the exciting performance of the Jiangsu team in the World Championships has once again warmed up badminton in Jiangsu. At present, enterprises have come to the door on their own initiative, hoping to have in-depth cooperation with the Jiangsu Badminton Team. Although it is just an intention and has not yet been signed, it has already made the Jiangsu Badminton Team see a glimmer of hope. Once the sponsorship funds are in place, the Jiangsu Team will no longer have to worry about whether to sell Chen Jin or not. ""If there is enough sponsorship, we will definitely keep Chen Jin in the team. No one wants to do this, and it is often helpless."" Sun Zhi'an told the reporter. Last year, due to insufficient funds, Jiangsu Badminton Club performed generally in the Badminton Super League and failed to advance to the finals. In fact, according to the strength of Jiangsu Team, if the club has sufficient operating funds, it will not be difficult to advance to the finals or even win the championship. Next month, I hope to have a new and old champion gathering in Jiangsu. I have just played the World Championships, but Chen Jin can't have a rest. He will go back to Beijing directly from Paris to continue training. Because next, he still needs to prepare for the National Championships and the Badminton Masters held in Changzhou, Jiangsu in the second half of next month. ""The Master's Tournament will start on the 10th in Changzhou. At that time, I must go to see my son because he must have no time to return to Nanjing."" Chen Jin's father, Jin Chao, told the reporter. In fact, some of the veterans of the Nanjing Badminton Team are also very concerned about Chen Jin's younger generation. The old world champion of badminton, Yang Yang, specifically called Chen Jin's father to ask him how to see the live broadcast of the game last night. Chen Jin won the championship, and Yang Yang was also happy for him. In fact, the old gold has an idea, which is to hope that Chen Jin can get together with these champion veterans in Nanjing when he comes back, ""There is no problem with Yang Yang, Sun Jun, and Chen Jin to ask them to get together. I am afraid that Chen Jin has no time to go back to Nanjing."" The old man told the reporter. Indeed, in addition to the competition, Chen Jin has been training with the national team for many years. I wonder if Chen Jin can take some time to go home to Nanjing this time when he returns to Changzhou, so close to Nanjing. Lv Yuan, a reporter from Express News"

比亚迪回归A股待批称新能源车有优势□本报记者张晓琳2009年在国家政策的推动下，车市一片大好。购置税优惠、汽车下乡、大力发展新能源、车企兼并重组等成为2009年汽车政策的关键词。昨日，《证券日报》记者独家采访了比亚迪销售公司副总经理兼新闻发言人王建钧，来解释新能源汽车的发展。国家政策推动新能源车发展《证券日报》：国家政策推动了2009年车市的火爆。具体到新能源车，国家给予了比亚迪何种优惠？王建钧：2009年初出台的《节能与新能源汽车示范推广财政补助资金管理暂行办法》中，国家对购买新能源车按照节油率和技术分级别补贴，不仅仅推动了新能源车产业的发展，还有利于引导自主品牌加快新能源车的研发与创新，促进新能源车技术的升级。这对比亚迪来说是一个很好的发展机遇，更加坚定了发展新能源汽车的决心和信心。比亚迪后续会推出多了款DM车型，包括F6DM、F0DM等，之后还会推出纯电动车型。目前，比亚迪F3DM已入选国家第一批《节能与新能源汽车示范应用工程推荐车型目录》，是轿车类唯一入选品牌。按照财政部于今年初发布的新能源车补贴办法，每一辆比亚迪F3DM将有机会争取到最高5万元的财政补贴。《证券日报》：您认为现在新能源汽车的竞争情况是怎样的？除比亚迪外，国内是否还有比较成熟的制造新能源汽车的企业？王建钧：目前，各国的汽车企业都在进行新能源车型的研发，因为新能源汽车是未来汽车发展的必然趋势，这一块的竞争也会日趋激烈。比亚迪一直坚持技术为王、创新为本的发展理念，比亚迪希望通过自己努力将这个社会变得更好、更健康，相信在新能源车领域比亚迪能够凭借自身的研发和技术取得竞争绝对优势地位，为社会创造更好的环境，打造一个绿色健康的明天。比通用、丰田有三大优势《证券日报》：作为新能源汽车领导者，比亚迪有哪些独特的竞争优势？王建钧：即使对比新能源车技术先进的通用、丰田而言，比亚迪仍有三大优势，第一，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车达到100公里行驶里程；第二，比亚迪F3DM有很强的动力性。百公里加速性能，比亚迪F3DM是10秒；第三，F3DM车实现了可插入式充电，家用220V的电源就可以进行充电。而且F3DM比丰田、通用提前实现了商品化，08年底已在国内上市。另外，比亚迪依托其产业背景，强大的垂直整合也是一大优势，比亚迪能够把电池、电控、电机技术有效结合在一起，实现了电动汽车的商业化运作。同时，比亚迪DM双模电动车还突破了反复充电、家用插座充电两大技术难关并且确保安全耐用。.《证券日报》：刚才您说比亚迪F3DM双模电动车已经入选国家第一批《节能与新能源汽车示范应用工程推荐车型目录》，但是很多消费者对这款双模电动车还不够了解，能否介绍一下这款车，双模电动车比一般车型有何优势？王建钧：与传统的燃油汽车相比，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车有以下两个特殊的优势：优越动力性能：F3DM搭载了BYD371QA全铝发动机，双模电动车驱动系统大幅度的提高了电机的功率和扭矩，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车最大输出功率达到了125KW，相当于拥有3.0L发动机的优越动力性能，将给驾驶者带来一种全新的驾驶快感。此外，在起步阶段，比亚迪F3DM双模电动车超强的瞬间加速性能，远超过3.0L级别的发动机所能达到的水平。使用成本低廉：在燃油经济性方面，F3DM双模电动车纯电动状态下百公里耗电仅为16度，电费按0.6元/kwh计算，其行驶100公里的花费约为9.6元人民币。DM双模动力系统采用的比亚迪最新发动机，使得系统中的发动机在任意工况下的最低燃油消耗率不足250g/kwh。而且相关调查显示，超过90%的人每天用车不超过100公里，这意味使用比亚迪DM双模电动车，绝大部分人将远离油价高企的困扰。因为用电的成本仅为使用燃油的1/4，对消费者来说，这无疑是一种绝对经济的选择。《证券日报》：新能源汽车科技攻关点有三方面：电池能力、发动机系统和电控系统，比亚迪在那个方面最为成功，在这三个方面比亚迪有何科研成果？王建钧：电池能力：比亚迪在新能源汽车领域采用了最先进的铁电池技术，引领了汽车动力的技术革新。汽车动力电池难在“高安全”、“低成本”、“长寿命”、“绿色环保”、“复杂工艺”等五个要求上。而比亚迪的“铁电池”在上述五个指标上都取得了突破。发动机系统：在上一问题中已经进行了阐述。电控系统：F3DM双模电动车搭载的是全球首创的DM双动力混合系统。DM为DUALMODE的缩写。DM双模电动车采用电动车系统(EV)和混合动力系统(HEV)。是一种将控制电机和电动机两种混合力量相结合的先进技术，不仅降低了油耗及排放，更极大的提高了动力和操控性能，实现了既可充电，又可加油的多种能源补充方式，实现了真正意义的双动力混合系统。已申报回归A股《证券日报》：比亚迪是否有回归A股的打算？王建钧：比亚迪在2009年7月发布公告明确比亚迪正在依据中证监相关法规按照流程进行申报，待有关部门批准后，拟赴深圳上市，发行不多于1亿股的A股，所得资金将用于拨付锂离子电池生产、汽车研发、扩展汽车产品及汽车零部件以及太阳能电池项目。比亚迪相信发行A股将为公司建立新融资平台，并可令公司扩展至不同证券市场，从而确保公司加强业务发展及进一步提高竞争力。《证券日报》：2009年比亚迪的销售情况如何？由于汽车批量生产能够大大降低成本，在2010年及未来的销售目标是怎样的？王建钧：2009年比亚迪汽车全年实现销售突破45万辆，超出预期的40万辆目标，同比增幅达162%，同时实现销量连续六年100%的增长。从2009年市场表现看来，功勋车F3连续月销突破3万辆，成为中国车市唯一“3万辆俱乐部”成员；F6新财富版，月销量超过6000辆；高端精品小车F0月销万辆以上，成为新一代微车王；新上市的中级精品家轿G3，也随着产能的提升，市场潜力进一步释放，冲击月销万辆。以上车型也有望在2010年持续放量增长，为比亚迪达成市场目标贡献力量。比亚迪计划在2010年推出L3、I6、G6、S6、M6等5款全新重磅车型，并通过致力于产品品质的完美提升，力争实现2010年80万辆的产销计划，力争再次实现100%的跨越增长。其中，L3、I6、G6、S6、M6等5款新车将担负17万辆的销售目标，进一步为经销商提供强有力新车支持。M6作为比亚迪首款高端全尺寸MPV，在伴随经济启稳迎来最佳上市时机，将在全网销售；L3已经登上最新一批国家新车目录，将是比亚迪又一款高端中级车；全新的G6、S6、I6等高端产品也将在2010年揭开神秘面纱。	王建钧,张晓琳	正向	"BYD returns to A-share pending approval, saying new energy vehicles have advantages □ Zhang Xiaolin, reporter of this newspaper In 2009, under the promotion of national policies, the car market was very good. Purchase tax preference, cars going to the countryside, development of new energy, merger and restructuring of automobile enterprises, etc. became the key words of automobile policies in 2009. Yesterday, the reporter of Securities Daily exclusively interviewed Wang Jianjun, vice president and spokesman of BYD Sales Corporation, to explain the development of new energy vehicles. National policies promote the development of new energy vehicles. Securities Daily: National policies have promoted the booming of the car market in 2009. As for new energy vehicles, what kind of preferential treatment has the state given to BYD? Wang Jianjun: At the beginning of 2009, the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Subsidies for the Demonstration and Promotion of Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicles, the state subsidizes the purchase of new energy vehicles according to the oil saving rate and technology level, which not only promotes the development of the new energy vehicle industry, but also helps to guide自主品牌to accelerate the research and development and innovation of new energy vehicles, and promote the upgrading of new energy vehicle technology. This is a good development opportunity for BYD, which has further strengthened its determination and confidence to develop new energy vehicles. BYD will later launch several DM models, including F6DM, F0DM, and then launch pure electric vehicles. At present, BYD F3DM has been selected as the only brand in the first batch of the National Catalogue of Recommended Models for Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Demonstration and Application Projects. According to the new energy vehicle subsidy method issued by the Ministry of Finance at the beginning of this year, each BYD F3DM will have the opportunity to win a maximum of 50000 yuan of financial subsidies. Securities Daily: What do you think of the current competition in the new energy vehicle industry? In addition to BYD, are there any other domestic enterprises that are mature in manufacturing new energy vehicles? Wang Jianjun: At present, automobile enterprises in various countries are developing new energy vehicle models, because new energy vehicles are the inevitable trend of future automobile development, and the competition in this area will also become increasingly fierce. BYD has always adhered to the development concept of technology as the king and innovation as the basis. BYD hopes to make the society better and healthier through its own efforts. It is believed that BYD can achieve a competitive advantage in the field of new energy vehicles by virtue of its own R&D and technology, create a better environment for the society, and create a green and healthy tomorrow. F3DM of BYD has three advantages over General Motors and Toyota · Securities Daily: As a leader of new energy vehicles, what are the unique competitive advantages of BYD? Wang Jianjun: Even in comparison with General Motors and Toyota, which have advanced new energy vehicle technologies, BYD still has three advantages: first, BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle has reached a driving range of 100 kilometers; Second, BYD F3DM has strong power. The acceleration performance of 100 km is 10 seconds for BYD F3DM; Third, the F3DM vehicle has achieved plug-in charging, and the 220V household power supply can be charged. Moreover, F3DM realized commercialization earlier than Toyota and General Motors, and was launched in China at the end of 08. In addition, BYD relies on its industrial background, and the powerful vertical integration is also a major advantage. BYD can effectively combine battery, electric control and motor technologies, which has realized the commercial operation of electric vehicles. At the same time, BYD DM dual-mode electric vehicles have also broken through two major technical difficulties of repeated charging and home socket charging, and ensured safety and durability. · Securities Daily: The BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle has been selected as the first batch of energy-saving and new energy vehicle demonstration and application projects in China, but many consumers are not familiar enough with this dual-mode electric vehicle. Can you introduce this vehicle? What are the advantages of the dual-mode electric vehicle compared with the general model? Wang Jianjun: Compared with the traditional fuel vehicles, BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicles have the following two special advantages: superior power performance: F3DM is equipped with BYD371QA all aluminum engine, and the dual-mode electric vehicle drive system greatly improves the power and torque of the motor. The maximum output power of BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle reaches 125KW, which is equivalent to the excellent power performance of 3.0L engine, which will bring a new driving pleasure to the driver. In addition, at the starting stage, the ultra strong instantaneous acceleration performance of BYD F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle far exceeds the level that can be reached by the 3.0L engine. Low use cost: In terms of fuel economy, the power consumption of F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle is only 16 degrees per 100 kilometers in pure electric state. According to the calculation of 0.6 yuan/kwh for electricity, the cost of its driving 100 kilometers is about 9.6 yuan. The latest engine adopted by DM dual-mode power system of BYD makes the minimum fuel consumption rate of the engine in the system less than 250g/kwh under any working conditions. Moreover, according to the survey, more than 90% of people use cars less than 100 kilometers a day, which means that most people will be free from the trouble of high oil prices when using BYD DM dual-mode electric vehicles. Because the cost of electricity is only 1/4 of that of fuel, it is undoubtedly an absolutely economic choice for consumers. · Securities Daily: There are three aspects of scientific and technological research and attack on new energy vehicles: battery capacity, engine system and electric control system. What is the most successful aspect of BYD in this regard, and what are the scientific research achievements of BYD in these three aspects? Wang Jianjun: Battery capacity: BYD adopts the most advanced iron battery technology in the field of new energy vehicles, leading the technological innovation of automobile power. The automobile power battery is difficult in five requirements: ""high safety"", ""low cost"", ""long life"", ""green and environmental protection"" and ""complex process"". BYD's ""iron battery"" has achieved a breakthrough in the above five indicators. Engine system: has been explained in the previous question. Electric control system: F3DM dual-mode electric vehicle is equipped with the world's first DM dual power hybrid system. DM is the abbreviation of DUAL MODE. DM dual-mode electric vehicles adopt electric vehicle system (EV) and hybrid power system (HEV). It is an advanced technology that combines the two hybrid forces of motor control and motor. It not only reduces fuel consumption and emissions, but also greatly improves power and control performance. It realizes a variety of energy replenishment methods that can be charged and refueled, and realizes the dual power hybrid system in the true sense. It has been declared to return to A-share · Securities Daily: Does BYD intend to return to A-share? Wang Jianjun: BYD announced in July 2009 that BYD is applying in accordance with the process according to the relevant regulations of CSRC. After the approval of the relevant departments, it is intended to go to Shenzhen for listing and issue no more than 100 million A-shares. The funds obtained will be used for the production of lithium-ion batteries, automobile research and development, expansion of automobile products and auto parts, and solar cell projects. BYD believes that the issuance of A-shares will establish a new financing platform for the company, and can make the company expand to different securities markets, so as to ensure that the company strengthens business development and further enhance its competitiveness. · Securities Daily: How was the sales of BYD in 2009? Since mass production of automobiles can greatly reduce costs, what are the sales targets in 2010 and the future? Wang Jianjun: BYD's automobile sales broke through 450000 vehicles in 2009, exceeding the target of 400000 vehicles, with a year-on-year increase of 162%, and the sales volume has grown by 100% for six consecutive years. From the market performance in 2009, the F3 merit car has sold more than 30000 vehicles for consecutive months, becoming the only member of the ""30000 vehicle club"" in China's car market; F6 New Wealth Edition, with a monthly sales of more than 6000 vehicles; F0, a high-end boutique small car, sells more than 10000 vehicles per month, becoming a new microcar king; G3, a new mid-class boutique sedan just launched, has also released its market potential with the increase of production capacity, and is expected to sell 10000 vehicles per month. The above models are also expected to continue to grow in volume in 2010, contributing to BYD's achievement of market goals. BYD plans to launch five new heavyweight models of L3, I6, G6, S6, M6 and other five new heavyweight models in 2010, and strive to achieve the production and sales plan of 800000 vehicles in 2010 by focusing on the perfect improvement of product quality, and strive to achieve a cross growth of 100% again. Among them, the five new cars of L3, I6, G6, S6, M6, etc. will bear the sales target of 170000 vehicles, further providing powerful new car support to dealers. M6, as BYD's first high-end full-size MPV, will usher in the best listing opportunity with the stabilization of the economy, and will be sold in the whole network; L3 has climbed to the latest batch of national new vehicle catalogues, and will be another high-end mid-level vehicle of BYD; The new G6, S6, I6 and other high-end products will also unveil the mysterious veil in 2010."
阿联连续3季得分500+篮板300+他正提速追赶姚明!新浪体育讯　北京时间3月30日，新泽西篮网坐镇主场IZOD中心，迎战圣安东尼奥马刺。最终，篮网以90-84击败马刺，易建联上阵31分钟，拿下8分、7个篮板。这场比赛是篮网本赛季的第10场胜利，他们凭借这场胜利彻底摆脱了NBA史上最差战绩纪录，而对阿联个人来说，这场比赛也颇具深意。本场比赛之前，阿联本赛季的总得分已经达到510分，篮板296个，只需要再抢4个篮板，他就可以连续第三个赛季完成单季得分500+和篮板300+的数据。要知道，此前在NBA能够达到以上数据的中国球员，只有休斯顿火箭的姚明一个。在自己的新秀赛季，阿联代表密尔沃基雄鹿出战66场比赛，最终拿到了566分、344个篮板；第二个赛季，刚刚转投篮网的阿联，出战61场比赛，最终拿到525分、326个篮板；本赛季，阿联频繁遭遇伤病，到目前为止仅出战44场比赛，如果剩余的8场比赛他全部参加，那么加起来也仅为52场比赛，必定创造个人NBA职业生涯的出勤率新低。但是，通过以上的数据对比我们不难看出，前两个赛季需要出战60场以上，阿联才能拿到得分500+和篮板300+，而如今出战40场以上，阿联就已经拿到了。因此，如果说阿联的第三季没有进步，显然是错误的，阿联已经提高了效率，变得更为高产。当然，和姚明连续7个赛季完成单季得分1000+和篮板400+的壮举相比，阿联还有很长的一段路要走，但是他至少已经证明，中国球员中并不是只有姚明一个能够真正立足NBA，他绝对不会是个NBA的匆匆过客。Yahoo体育近期曾表示，如何完成本赛季最后9场比赛(现为8场)，将是阿联这个因为伤病变得支离破碎的赛季最为关键的考评，倘若阿联能够强势收尾，必定可以给篮网足够的信心，选择在新赛季继续把他留在阵中。　今天，阿联忍着右肩的疼痛，在第四节投中了反超比分的一球，帮助篮网赢得了胜利，相信在后面8场比赛里，他也会继续证明自己的价值。(一分钱)	姚明,易建联,阿联	正向	The UAE has scored 500+ rebounds for 300+ consecutive seasons, and he is speeding up to catch up with Yao Ming! Sina Sports News On March 30, Beijing time, the New Jersey Nets played against the San Antonio Spurs at the home of IZOD Center. In the end, the Nets beat the Spurs 90-84, and Yi Jianlian played for 31 minutes to score 8 points and 7 rebounds. This game was the 10th victory of the Nets this season, and they completely摆脱ed the worst record in NBA history with this victory, and this game was also meaningful to Liuhe personally. Before this game, Liuhe's total score this season had reached 510 points and 296 rebounds. He only needs to grab another four rebounds, and he can complete the single season score of 500+ and 300+ rebounds for the third consecutive season. It is worth noting that the only Chinese player in the NBA who can achieve the above data is Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets. In his rookie season, Liuhe played 66 games on behalf of the Milwaukee Bucks and finally got 566 points and 344 rebounds; In the second season, Liuhe, who had just transferred to the Nets, played 61 games and finally got 525 points and 326 rebounds; This season, Liuhe frequently suffered from injuries, and he only played 44 games up to now. If he participated in all of the remaining 8 games, it would only be 52 games in total, which must create a new low attendance rate for his personal NBA career. However, through the above data comparison, it is not difficult to see that Liuhe needs to play more than 60 games in the first two seasons to get 500+ points and 300+ rebounds. Nowadays, Liuhe has got more than 40 games. Therefore, it is obviously wrong to say that Liuhe's third season has not progressed. Liuhe has become more productive by improving his efficiency. Of course, compared with Yao Ming's achievement of completing 1000+ points and 400+ rebounds in a single season for seven consecutive seasons, Liuhe still has a long way to go, but he has at least proved that there is not only one Yao Ming in Chinese players who can truly stand in the NBA, and he will never be a hasty passer-by in the NBA. Yahoo Sports recently said that how to complete the last 9 games of this season (now 8 games) will be the most critical evaluation of Liuhe's season, which has been fragmented due to injuries. If Liuhe can end the season strongly, he must give the Nets enough confidence to choose to keep him in the new season. Today, Liuhe endured the pain of his right shoulder and scored a goal in the fourth quarter to help the Nets win. I believe that in the next eight games, he will continue to prove his value.

热点聚焦：“猪流感”会影响加美移民吗近日有网友提问：猪流感会影响移民吗？虽然移民行业是以政策为导向，目前还没有看到主流的移民国家因猪流感而专门提出修改或调整移民政策的通告，但因为猪流感而引起的与日常生活相关的系列问题正在发酵。截至北京时间28日晚，墨西哥确诊和疑似死于猪流感的人数已上升至152人，疑似感染者已近2000名。针对当前猪流感的蔓延趋势，世界卫生组织已经将流感大流行警告级别从之前的3级提高到4级，“第4级”意味着一种新病毒在人际间传播，可以引起“群体性”暴发。据报道，为防患于未然，世界多个国家已经启动应急措施，并对从美国本土、加拿大和墨西哥抵达本国的直飞航班，实施机舱内的红外体温检测，防范猪流感入境引发可能的大流行。美国、加拿大作为老牌移民国家同时成为本次猪流感的重灾区，从现阶段来看，在一定程度上难免造成近期登陆的客人心理上的恐慌，从长远来看，一次临时的病毒性传染症应该不会对移民行业造成影响。更有网友戏谑的说：现阶段如果是猪要办理移民的话才会被禁止登陆。目前，世卫组织也依然没有建议采取限制旅行和关闭边界的应对措施，因此，笔者建议大家不要担忧，如果有移民的意愿，抓紧在这金融危机移民政策相对宽松的时期及时办理移民申请。		正向	"Focus on hot spots: will ""swine flu"" affect immigration in Canada and the United States? Recently, netizens asked: will swine flu affect immigrants? Although the immigration industry is policy oriented, there is no notice from the mainstream immigration countries to modify or adjust the immigration policy due to swine flu at present, but a series of problems related to daily life caused by swine flu are fermenting. As of 28 o'clock that night, Beijing time, the number of people in Mexico who were confirmed and suspected to have died of swine flu had risen to 152, and nearly 2000 people were suspected to have been infected. In view of the current spread trend of swine flu, the World Health Organization has raised the influenza pandemic warning level from 3 to 4, and the ""fourth level"" means that a new virus spreads between people, which can cause ""group"" outbreaks. It is reported that in order to prevent problems before they occur, many countries in the world have started emergency measures, and infrared thermometers in the cabin have been implemented for direct flights arriving from the United States, Canada and Mexico to prevent the possible epidemic caused by the entry of swine flu. As old immigration countries, the United States and Canada are also the hardest hit areas in this swine flu. At this stage, they will inevitably cause panic in the minds of the guests who have landed recently. In the long run, a temporary viral infectious disease should not have an impact on the immigration industry. Some netizens joked that at this stage, pigs would be prohibited from landing if they were going to apply for immigration. At present, the World Health Organization still does not suggest taking measures to restrict travel and close borders, so I suggest you not to worry. If you want to immigrate, apply for immigration at this time when the financial crisis immigration policy is relatively relaxed."

德法首脑会在即希腊7月或将获救援汇通网6月17日讯——周四(16日)欧元/瑞郎触及纪录低位，因市场担忧希腊债务问题有可能进一步恶化，且政府将不能就紧缩措施达成共识。然而在欧盟(EU)经济与货币理事瑞恩(OlliRehn)发表乐观言论后，欧元削减跌幅。瑞恩称，希腊只要削减预算，就能在7月份获得欧盟和国际货币基金组织(IMF)的贷款。IMF也在声明中表示支持瑞恩。荷兰国际集团(INGGroepNV)驻纽约货币交易主管JohnMcCarthy称：“我们看到全球经济数据普遍疲软，加之对希腊债务的忧虑仍然弥漫市场，两者对风险情绪皆不利，这也是市场抛售欧元的另一个原因。”新西兰银行(BankofNewZealandLtd。)货币策略师MikeBurrowes指出，如果风险情绪继续弥漫市场，并且市场对欧元区债务问题的担忧无法缓解的话，预计欧元/美元将继续承压走低，而美元、瑞郎和日元将从避险买盘中受益。欧元/瑞郎目前交投于1.2025附近，较上个交易日下跌0.60%，盘中刷新纪录低位1.1946；另外欧元/美元目前交投于1.4150附近，较上个交易日下跌0.14%，盘中触及5月26日以来最低1.4073。高盛集团公司(GoldmanSachsGroupInc。)首席货币策略师ThomasStolper在一次电话会议中指出，瑞郎兑欧元已成为最被高估的货币对。在紧缩计划遭到反对党的反对后，希腊总理帕潘德里欧(GeorgePapandreou)今日将重组内阁并试图重新赢得公众的信任票。欧盟理事瑞恩在“密切接触”IMF之后确信周末的会议将通过一项决议，那就是只要希腊能够削减预算，就将在7月份获得120亿欧元的援助。为了避开欧元区的首次违约，作为去年一揽子救援计划的一部分，今年7月份欧盟将为希腊提供87亿欧元，另外33亿则由IMF提供。IMF的一位女代言人CarolineAtkinson周四在一封电子邮件中声明：“有关对希腊救助的讨论正在取得进展，以确保获取充分的融资项目，我们期望在下一次欧元集团会议中能有积极的结果。”德意志银行(DeutscheBankAG)10国集团(G10)驻纽约全球首席外汇策略师AlanRuskin称：“随着希腊在7月份获得援助出现一线希望，市场风险偏好情绪也有了些许好转。”德国总理默克尔(AngelaMerkel)与法国总理萨科齐(NicolasSarkozy)明日将在柏林举行会议，致力于就希腊一揽子援助计划达成一致。高盛预期，欧元/美元在未来3、6、12个月的汇价分别为1.45、1.50和1.55。	ThomasStolper,OlliRehn,GeorgePapandreou,JohnMcCarthy,AlanRuskin,AngelaMerkel,MikeBurrowes,NicolasSarkozy,CarolineAtkinson	正向	"The leaders of Germany and France will meet in Greece in July or later. The Huaitong News on June 17-Thursday (16) - The euro/Swiss franc hit a record low because the market was worried that the Greek debt problem could further deteriorate, and the government would not agree on austerity measures. However, the euro cut its losses after OlliRehn, the EU (EU) economic and monetary affairs council, made an optimistic speech. Rehn said that Greece could obtain loans from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July as long as it cut its budget. The IMF also supported Rehn in its statement. John McCarthy, head of currency trading at ING Groep NV in New York, said: ""We see that the global economic data is generally weak, and the worry about Greece's debt is still spreading in the market, which is detrimental to the risk sentiment. This is another reason why the market is selling the euro."" Mike Burrowes, a currency strategist at the Bank of New Zealand (Bank of New Zealand Ltd.), pointed out that if the risk aversion continues to spread in the market and the market's worries about the debt problem in the euro area cannot be alleviated, it is expected that the euro/dollar will continue to come under pressure, while the dollar, Swiss franc and yen will benefit from hedging purchases. The euro/Swiss franc is currently trading around 1.2025, down 0.60% from the previous trading day, hitting a record low of 1.1946 during the trading day; The euro/dollar is currently trading around 1.4150, down 0.14% from the previous trading day, hitting the lowest level of 1.4073 since May 26. Thomas Stolper, chief currency strategist of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., pointed out in a telephone conference that the Swiss franc against the euro had become the most overvalued currency pair. After the austerity program was opposed by the opposition party, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will reshuffle the cabinet today and try to win back the public's trust vote. After ""close contact"" with the IMF, Rehn, the EU council, was convinced that the weekend meeting would pass a resolution that Greece would receive 12 billion euros of aid in July as long as it could cut its budget. In order to avoid the first default of the eurozone, as part of last year's package of rescue measures, the EU will provide 8.7 billion euros to Greece in July of this year, and another 3.3 billion will be provided by the IMF. Caroline Atkinson, a female spokesperson of the International Monetary Fund, declared in an email on Thursday: ""The discussion on Greece's rescue is making progress to ensure that sufficient financing projects can be obtained, and we expect a positive result at the next Eurogroup meeting."" Alan Ruskin, the global chief foreign exchange strategist of Deutsche Bank (Deutsche Bank AG) in New York, G10, said: ""As Greece has a glimmer of hope of receiving aid in July, the market risk preference has also improved slightly."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Berlin tomorrow to reach an agreement on the Greek package aid plan. Goldman Sachs expects the exchange rate of the euro/dollar to be 1.45, 1.50 and 1.55 in the next 3, 6 and 12 months respectively."

欧盟成员国仍未就解除对华军售达成一致中国日报网消息：英文《中国日报》2月5日报道：欧盟国家仍未就是否解除对华军售达成一致，匈牙利外交部长昨日在重庆表示。该国外长BalázsPéter指出，是否解禁需要欧盟27个成员国协商决定，“而问题在于解除的条件是否满足”。“确实，这个问题非常敏感，”Péter外长告诉中国日报。“我们(成员国)需要进行讨论。看条件是否满足，在什么时机要满足什么条件，”他表示，但没有详细说明。1989年欧盟开始对华实行武器禁售，但上个月自从西班牙开始担任为期半年的欧盟轮值主席国后，对这一热点的讨论很激烈。西班牙外长MiguelAngelMoratinos1月26表示该国正对欧盟对华禁售武器的“优缺点进行衡量”。Moratinos外长补充，除了西班牙外，法国一直是主要的支持取消该禁令的国家，而“西班牙正加入这一支持取消的队列”。早期西班牙驻华大使CarlosBlascoVilla也告诉中国日报，该国“希望能进一步讨论取消这一禁令”。但是匈牙利外长Péter昨日指出，所有的欧盟成员国在此问题上必须达成一致。“我们与欧盟其它26个成员国结成了密切的同盟。我们有义务就相应取消禁运的相关步骤与26个国家进行讨论”，他在昨日匈牙利驻中国西南地区重庆市总领馆开幕仪式后说。尽管部长表明匈牙利并不赞成限制贸易，但武器是“敏感的产品，与和平及稳定紧密相连。”“这需要27个国家来决定。与当时只有6个组建国相比，欧盟现在变得越为复杂。我们必须与欧洲的伙伴国达成共识，”他补充。不仅如此，一家商业信息服务网站Eubusiness.com援引未透露姓名的外交官表示，出于安保方面的影响，欧盟对解除禁运有所保留，除非是和美国同步进行才行。但是乔治·华盛顿大学教授、现中国社科院访问学者DavidShambaugh并不认为美国会对中国和欧盟在此问题上产生影响。“这个问题还没有定论，但我认为禁运不会解除”，而且这一国家集团并未达成一致，Shambaugh昨日在欧盟驻华代表团活动下说。他表示，中欧各国(包括匈牙利)以及北欧斯堪地纳维亚各国都并不赞同取消禁令。而欧盟其它大国如德国和英国也尚未做出决定。然而，解禁将大幅提升中国和欧盟的关系，中国社科院欧洲研究所分析员赵晨指出。“解除对华武器禁运更多来说是一个政治议题，而非纯军事问题。”赵晨说中东欧一些国家由于没有什么军工厂，因为无法从解禁中获得什么实在的好处。而反对解禁，也因为这些国家仍然在从价值观的角度来看待今天的中国。不过如果武器禁运被解除，“将会是中欧关系全面回暖的一个重要迹象，”赵晨说。(中国日报记者张海洲于北京王化中于重庆报道)	赵晨,DavidShambaugh,张海洲	正向	"The member states of the European Union have not yet agreed on lifting the arms embargo on China. China Daily News reported on February 5, the English edition of China Daily reported: The EU countries have not yet agreed on whether to lift the arms embargo on China, the Hungarian Foreign Minister said yesterday in Chongqing. The foreign minister of that country, Balazs Peter, pointed out that it was necessary for the 27 member states of the European Union to decide whether to lift the ban, ""and the problem is whether the conditions for lifting the ban are met"". ""Indeed, this question is very sensitive,"" Foreign Minister Péter told China Daily. ""We (members) need to discuss. See if the conditions are met, what conditions should be met at what time,"" he said without specifying. The EU started to ban arms sales to China in 1989, but the discussion on this hotspot has been very intense since Spain became the rotating chairman of the EU for half a year last month. On January 26, Miguel Angel Moratinos, the Spanish Foreign Minister, said that the country was ""weighing the advantages and disadvantages"" of the EU's ban on arms sales to China. Moratinos added that France has always been the main supporter of lifting the ban, and ""Spain is joining the queue to support the lifting of the ban"". Carlos Blasco Villa, the early Spanish ambassador to China, also told China Daily that the country ""hopes to further discuss the lifting of the ban"". But Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter pointed out yesterday that all EU member states must reach an agreement on this issue. ""We have formed a close alliance with 26 other member states of the European Union. We have the obligation to discuss the relevant steps of the corresponding embargo lifting with 26 countries"", he said after the opening ceremony of the General Consulate of Hungary in Chongqing, Southwest China, yesterday. Although the minister made it clear that Hungary did not favor trade restrictions, weapons are ""sensitive products closely related to peace and stability"". ""This requires 27 countries to decide. The EU has become more complicated now than when there were only 6 member countries. We must reach an agreement with our partners in Europe,"" he added. In addition, a commercial information service website Eubusiness. com quoted an unnamed diplomat as saying that the EU had reservations about lifting the embargo unless it was in line with the United States due to the security impact. But David Shambaugh, a professor at George Washington University and now a visiting scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, did not think that the United States would have an impact on China and the European Union on this issue. ""The issue is not yet settled, but I don't think the embargo will be lifted,"" and the group of countries has not reached an agreement, Shambaugh said yesterday at the event of the EU delegation to China. He said that countries in Central and Eastern Europe (including Hungary) and Nordic Scandinavian countries did not agree to lift the ban. And other major EU countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom have not yet made a decision. However, Chen Zhao, an analyst at the Institute of European Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that lifting the ban would greatly enhance the relationship between China and the European Union. ""Lifting the arms embargo on China is more of a political issue than a pure military issue."" Zhao Chen said that some countries in Central and Eastern Europe have no arms factories, so they can not get any real benefits from the lifting of the ban. And opposing the lifting of the ban is also because these countries still view today's China from the perspective of values. However, if the arms embargo is lifted, ""it will be an important sign of a comprehensive warming of China EU relations,"" said Zhao Chen.

甘肃舟曲男子将三轮车改制成皮筏救出74人故事1：自制皮筏，下江救人这是一个在灾民中口口相传的故事：一位三轮车司机依靠自制皮筏救出了74个人。江盘乡南桥村的三轮车司机王明昌依靠三轮车运营为生，8月7日晚，王明昌因为与朋友聚会，没有在房内睡觉，因此躲过一劫。当他回到家里时，两层小楼已被泥石流夷为平地，周围一片哀嚎声。王明昌看到不少房子还被泥石流冲到了江里，一些灾民登上废墟高处正在呼救。王明昌想起了自己营生的三轮车，于是将三个轮子拆下，拿来木板扎成了一个简陋的皮筏子。舟曲的青峰宾馆被泥石流冲下白龙江，不少旅客在窗户边上探出头来，不断呼救。王明昌撑着小艇冲下江去，面对汹涌的江水，不知是熟悉驾驶这一行，还是救人的执着战胜了恐惧，王明昌很快掌握了小皮筏的秘诀。小皮筏每次只能救一两个人，王明昌就一次次地来回救人，足足救了74个人。王爱强和王彩强是王明昌的邻居，灾难发生后，他们没有顾及家中的财产抢救，也第一时间加入到救人的队伍里。有三个灾民被困在堰塞湖的崖边，只能紧紧地抓住崖边的石头才没有落入江中，情况十分危急。王爱强兄弟挨家挨户借来绳子，再把绳子连着一起，接到了50米长。王爱强兄弟拿着绳子来到堰塞湖崖边，将绳子套住灾民，再慢慢放到王明昌的小皮筏上。这三个灾民获救后，一看他们的手，十个手指的指甲全都翻开了，没有一个好的。故事2：大声呼叫，9人逃出49岁的奂义民，是舟曲城关镇皇庙山人，做饮料批发生意。8月7日深夜，他正在家里睡觉，突然听到房屋背后的山上，有流水的声音，他下意识判断可能是泥石流。奂义民说，这次泥石流的声音比以前都要大，他当即叫醒还在熟睡中的妻子和两个儿子。奂义民跑到自己3楼上，朝楼下的居民大声叫喊：“快起来啊，快往山上跑。”奂义民厮声力竭地叫喊了十多声，并且声音越喊越大，但楼下回应的居民不多，奂义民的嗓子都喊哑了。几分钟后，有9名居民从山下往上跑，来到奂义民的家中呆着，最后幸免于难。奂义民回忆说，泥石流越来越大，山上的大石头也不断往下翻滚，砸到山下的房屋后，阵阵房屋倒塌声传来，还有玻璃破碎的声响。不到半个小时，他家楼下的几户人家，已全部被泥石流冲走，房屋已不复存在。“我从来没有遇到过……太可怕了”，回想起当时的情形，奂义民依旧无法平静。在这次灾害中，奂义民经营的两个经营门面被淹没，他说，损失达百万余元。但想到一家人能够存活下来，奂义民已觉得这是万幸。两个儿子现都在做志愿者，义务帮县城受灾居民搬运物品。另外让奂义民庆幸的是，他的父母居住在县城大坝附近一栋3层楼内，事发时都被救出。羊城晚报记者许琛	王明昌,奂义民,王爱强,王彩强,许琛	正向	"The story of a man in Zhouqu, Gansu, who converted a tricycle into a raft to save 74 people Story 1: Homemade raft, down the river to save people This is a story that has been passed on by word of mouth among the victims: a tricycle driver relies on a self-made raft to save 74 people. Wang Mingchang, a tricycle driver in Nanzhao Village, Jiangpan Township, relies on tricycles for his living. On the evening of August 7, Wang Mingchang did not sleep in his house because he was having a party with his friends, so he escaped the disaster. When he returned home, the two-story small building had been flattened by the mudslide, and there was a wailing sound around him. Wang Mingchang saw that many houses were still being washed into the river by the mudslide, and some victims were calling for help on the top of the ruins. Wang Mingchang thought of his tricycle for living, so he removed the three wheels and took a wooden board to make a simple raft. The Qingfeng Hotel in Zhouqu was rushed down the Bai Longjiang River by the mudslide, and many tourists were poking their heads out of the window, crying for help. Wang Mingchang supported the boat and rushed down the river. Faced with the surging river water, he did not know whether he was familiar with driving or the persistence of saving people had overcome fear, and Wang Mingchang quickly mastered the secret of the small raft. The small raft can only save one or two people at a time, so Wang Mingchang saved 74 people again and again. Wang Aiqiang and Wang Caiqiang are Wang Mingchang's neighbors. After the disaster, they did not care about the property rescue at home, but also joined the rescue team at the first time. Three victims were trapped on the cliff of the blocked lake. They could only hold the stone at the edge of the cliff tightly without falling into the river. The situation was very dangerous. Wang Aiqiang's brother borrowed ropes from door to door, and then connected them together to reach 50 meters long. Wang Aiqiang's brother came to the bank of the blocked lake with a rope, put the rope around the victim, and then slowly put it on Wang Mingchang's small raft. When these three victims were rescued, they looked at their hands, and all the ten fingernails were turned over, without a good one. Story 2: Cry loudly, 9 people escape. Huanyi, 49 years old, is a person of Huangmiaoshan, Chengguan Town, Zhouqu. He is in the beverage wholesale business. On the night of August 7, he was sleeping at home when he suddenly heard the sound of water on the hill behind his house. He subconsciously judged that it might be a mudslide. Huanyi said that the sound of this mudslide was louder than before, and he immediately woke up his wife and two sons who were still sleeping. Huanyi ran to his third floor and shouted loudly to the residents downstairs: ""Get up quickly, run quickly to the mountain."" Huanyi screamed for more than a dozen times, and his voice became louder and louder, but there were not many residents responding downstairs, and Huanyi's throat was screaming. A few minutes later, nine residents ran up from the mountain and stayed in Huanyi's house, and finally escaped the disaster. Huanyi recalled that the mudslide was getting bigger and bigger, and the big stones on the mountain were rolling down continuously. After hitting the house at the foot of the mountain, the sound of the house collapsing came, and there was a sound of glass breaking. In less than half an hour, several households under his house had been swept away by the mudslide, and the house no longer existed. ""I've never met... It's terrible"", recalling the situation at that time, Huanyi still could not calm down. In this disaster, two operating facades operated by Huanyi were flooded. He said that the loss was more than one million yuan. But thinking that the family can survive, Huanyi feels that it is very lucky. Both sons are now volunteering to help county residents move goods free of charge. Another thing that made Huanyi fortunate was that his parents lived in a three-story building near the dam in the county. They were all rescued when the accident happened.

网宿科技高成长性成疑：业务门槛低大客户集中挂着高科技的牌子，但其实质更像是服务提供商，网宿科技(300017)上市前高管声称未来三年复合增长50%的目标，已经难以受到市场认同。上市后业绩大变脸上市前的2009年前三季度，网宿科技实现净利润3486万元，同比增长39.38%。但是2009年全年，网宿科技净利润为3885.14万元，同比仅增长4.78%，但扣除非经常性损益后网宿科技的净利润同比下降4.79%。也就是说，公司2009年四季度业绩大幅下降。2010年一季度业绩下滑更猛，网宿科技一季度业绩显示净利润为503.8万元，同比大幅下降61.13%，营业收入也同比减少5.54%。对此，网宿科技的解释是由于国家对互联网展开整顿，抑制了一部分IDC和CDN业务的需求。然而，这一解释并不能完全被市场接受，因为在营业收入下降的情况下，网宿科技的各项成本却大幅增长，其中销售费用同比增长90.74%；管理费用同比增长44.73%。同时，公司还出现一上市后总经理就辞职的情况。业务门槛低除成本因素外，造成网宿科技业绩不佳的根本原因是公司业务。网宿科技的主营业务为两块，一块是IDC业务，一块为CDN业务。所谓IDC业务，其实就是网络服务器租用和托管以及相关的其他业务。CDN业务即为内容分发网络业务，通过在现有的Internet中增加一层新的网络架构，使用户获取离用户最近的服务器，提高网络连接速度。“IDC业务几乎不具备技术含量，仅仅是提供网络设备空间的一个服务。这一业务目前有很多家公司涉足，尽管网宿科技声称自身为IDC业务的领头羊，但是其市场份额很小，仅有几个百分点。”信达证券IT业务分析师边铁城表示，“CDN业务具备一定的技术含量，未来的需求会越来越多。”然而，即使是CDN业务也缺乏门槛。国外CDN业务已经开展多年，国内的CDN业务不具备任何技术优势，仅需要一定的设备投入即可加入。缺乏独特客户资源对网宿科技涉及的业务而言，其销售和渠道恐怕更为重要。但是目前看来，网宿科技在这一方面也缺乏优势。在招股说明书中，网宿科技表示在网络游戏与流媒体行业，市场上较为知名的公司均与网宿科技签订有长期服务合同，客户包括腾讯、搜狐、久游网等等。然而，为这些客户提供CDN、IDC服务的还有很多业务商，客户不具备任何排他性。尤其是部分原CDN业务的客户已经开始自行开展CDN业务，比如优酷网、土豆网等。公司的另一个隐患是，网宿科技的大客户过于集中，有25%以上的业务收入来自腾讯。“如果腾讯CDN也自己做了呢？网宿科技还有业绩吗？”一位股民在股吧上这样质疑。成长性难撑股价行业竞争激烈又缺乏独特客户资源，这就意味着网宿科技缺乏足够的议价能力。这一问题已经从公司不断下降的毛利率反映出来，2010年一季度公司综合毛利率从去年同期的37.75%下降至本期的34.93%。“从目前的情况来看，网宿科技希望保持营业收入年复合增长30%是可能的，但保持净利润年30%的增长率是较为困难的，而30%的成长性是一家小公司最基本的要求。”一位券商IT行业分析师指出，“IT行业的市盈率在30倍到40倍之间，网宿科技的股价远远超出合理估值。”对应2009年市盈率，网宿科技的市盈率为52倍。因此，很多券商在撰写的报告中也不看好公司未来的股价上涨，对公司给予“中性评级”。商报记者陈洁	边铁城,陈洁	负向	"The high growth of Wangsu Technology is questionable: the low threshold of business and the concentration of key customers are labeled as high technology, but in fact, it is more like a service provider. Before the listing of Wangsu Technology (300017), the executives claimed that the goal of 50% compound growth in the future three years has been difficult to win the recognition of the market. The performance changed dramatically before the listing. In the first three quarters of 2009, Wangsu Technology achieved a net profit of 34.86 million yuan, up 39.38% year on year. However, in 2009, Wangsu Technology's net profit was 38.8514 million yuan, up only 4.78% year on year. However, after deducting non recurring expenses, Wangsu Technology's net profit fell 4.79% year on year. That is to say, the company's performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 has decreased significantly. The performance in the first quarter of 2010 declined more sharply. The performance in the first quarter of Wangsu Technology showed that the net profit was 5.038 million yuan, down 61.13% year on year, and the operating income also decreased 5.54% year on year. In this regard, Wang Su Technology explained that the state had launched a rectification of the Internet, which curtailed the demand for some IDC and CDN businesses. However, this explanation can not be completely accepted by the market, because in the case of declining operating revenue, various costs of Wangsu Technology have increased substantially, including a year-on-year increase of 90.74% in selling expenses; Management expenses increased by 44.73% year on year. At the same time, the company also appeared a situation that the general manager resigned immediately after listing. In addition to the cost factors, the fundamental reason for the poor performance of Wangsu Technology is the company's business. Wangsu Technology's main business is divided into two parts: IDC and CDN. IDC business is actually the leasing and hosting of network servers and other related businesses. CDN business is content distribution network business, which adds a new network architecture to the existing Internet to make users get the server closest to them and improve the network connection speed. ""IDC business has almost no technology content. It is just a service that provides network equipment space. This business has been involved by many companies at present. Although Wangsu Technology claims to be the leader in the IDC business, its market share is very small, only a few percentage points."" Bian Tiecheng, IT business analyst of Xinda Securities, said, ""CDN business has some technical content, and the future demand will grow more and more."" However, even CDN business has no threshold. Foreign CDN business has been carried out for many years, and the domestic CDN business has no technical advantages. It only needs some equipment investment to join. The lack of unique customer resources is more important for the business involved in Wang Su Technology, I'm afraid. But at present, Wangsu Technology also lacks advantages in this regard. In the prospectus, Wangsu Technology said that in the field of online games and streaming media, the well-known companies in the market had signed long-term service contracts with Wangsu Technology, including Tencent, Sohu, Jiyou.com, etc. However, there are still many service providers providing CDN and IDC services to these customers, and customers do not have any exclusivity. In particular, some customers of the original CDN business have begun to carry out CDN business on their own, such as Youku.com and Tudou.com. Another potential danger of the company is that the major customers of Wangsu Technology are too concentrated, with more than 25% of the business income coming from Tencent. ""What if Tencent CDN also does it itself? Does Wangsu Technology have any performance?"" A stockholder questioned in the stock bar. The fierce industry competition and the lack of unique customer resources mean that Wangsu Technology lacks sufficient pricing power. This problem has already been reflected from the company's declining gross profit margin. In the first quarter of 2010, the company's comprehensive gross profit margin fell from 37.75% in the same period of last year to 34.93% in this period. ""From the current situation, it is possible for Wangsu Technology to maintain a compound annual growth rate of 30% in terms of operating revenue, but it is more difficult to maintain a growth rate of 30% in terms of net profit, and 30% growth is the most basic requirement of a small company."" An IT industry analyst at a securities company pointed out that ""the price-earnings ratio of the IT industry is between 30 and 40 times, and the stock price of Wangsu Technology is far beyond the reasonable valuation."" In correspondence with the 2009 price-earnings ratio, the price-earnings ratio of Wangsu Technology is 52 times. Therefore, many securities companies also do not expect the company's future share price to rise in the reports they write, and give the company a ""neutral rating"". Chen Jie, business reporter"

In addition, the Sijia Group, which shelved its listing in February this year due to poor market conditions, intends to return in the near future.

The report said that the Agricultural Bank did not disclose the time and scale of the IPO in the invitation document. Previously, it was reported that the A+H fundraising of ABC Bank may reach 200 billion yuan (29.3 billion US dollars). The issuance of such large-scale stocks in China and Hong Kong will make the IPO of ABC the largest in the world, exceeding the US $22 billion of its larger peer ICBC (1398) when it was listed in 2006.

佳华百货预计2010年盈利本报讯香港上市公司佳华百货控股董事会昨日发布公告称，预计2010年公司业绩将录得盈利。早前有报导指，佳华管理层表示将抓住利好势头，希望5年内能在全国范围内增开50至80间分店，每年销售金额达到50至80亿人民币。佳华百货在2009年为进行业务结构调整，一次性拨备4091.8万元人民币关闭了两家亏损门店，并对其他门店进行全面装修，如撇除有关拨备，公司业绩明显改善，2010年营业额持续上扬。事实上，公司财务状况一直十分良好，2010年上半年资产负债率不到38%，公司可用于营业费用的流动资金更高达2.49亿港币。加之在港上市时筹得的3亿港币，目前只用了1.3亿。由此可见，佳华目前的有充足的资金全力发展、扩大业务。近期佳华股价一路上扬，日前更冲上1.03高位。相比09年同期业绩亏损报告，今年业绩录得盈利相信令投资者们信心大增，未来发展空间进一步扩大。(谢诚)欢迎发表评论我要评论	谢诚	正向	Jiahua Department Store, a Hong Kong listed company, announced yesterday that it is expected to make a profit in 2010. Earlier reports said that Jiahua's management said that they would seize the favorable momentum and hope to open 50 to 80 branches nationwide in 5 years, with annual sales up to 50 to 80 billion yuan. Jiahua Department Store allocated 40.918 million yuan at one time in 2009 to close two loss making stores in order to adjust its business structure, and carried out comprehensive renovation of other stores. If the relevant provisions were excluded, the company's performance has obviously improved, and the turnover in 2010 continued to rise. In fact, the company's financial condition has always been very good. In the first half of 2010, the asset liability ratio was less than 38%, and the working capital available for business expenses was as high as 249 million Hong Kong dollars. In addition, 300 million Hong Kong dollars was raised when it was listed in Hong Kong, and only 130 million Hong Kong dollars has been used so far. It can be seen that Jiahua currently has sufficient funds to fully develop and expand its business. Recently, Jiahua's stock price has been rising, and it has hit a high of 1.03 the other day. Compared with the loss report of the same period in 09, this year's performance has made a profit, which is believed to have greatly increased the confidence of investors, and the future development space has been further expanded.

刘雪华曾与刘德凯内地结婚被骗当小三遭家暴谷音和刘雪华是多年好友，两人合作过琼瑶连续剧《庭院深深》、《几度夕阳红》、《烟雨蒙蒙》。1990年，刘雪华在承德拍琼瑶《雪珂》时，刘德凯追到承德，传出二刘在当地结婚，谷音证实，当时确实以办桌的方式举行结婚仪式，是刘德凯为安抚刘雪华而请客。两人回台后，刘雪华问刘德凯何时登记结婚？刘德凯又使出拖字诀，令她很难过。离婚谎言误当小三谷音是刘德凯前妻王景平的好姐妹。她说，大家都以为刘德凯和王景平已经离婚，事实上没有。他和刘雪华说自己离婚，被蒙在鼓里的刘雪华不知道自己做了多年小三。后来，他因王景平是美国公民取得绿卡，离婚后火速和法国女友安琪结婚。谷音说，当时她和赵永馨、李丽凤等一票好友在刘雪华家里，陪着她哭得唏哩哗啦。否认金援纯粹起哄过去传说，刘德凯不只一次对刘雪华动手，她铁了心要分手，但刘德凯不肯放。谷音说：“当时雪华很红，收入不错，刘德凯一直想当制作人、导演，自己创业，雪华陆续资助了他近3000万(新台币)。金钱加上感情，要分很难。”最后，两人终究分手，结束了6年双刘恋。刘德凯是否归还这笔钱，她从没听刘雪华提起过。正在云南拍戏的刘德凯对此回应：“那件事(结婚)都过了10多年，我不想再提。我的公司不是我独资，我没有缺钱，并没有借钱或金援这种事。”他叹气：“发生在她身上的意外，大家都很伤心，很多事就不要再说了。”	刘德凯,谷音,安琪,李丽凤,刘雪华,赵永馨,王景平,琼瑶	负向	"Liu Xuehua once married Liu Dekai in the mainland to be deceived as a third party and was victimized by Gu Yin and Liu Xuehua. They were good friends for many years. They co operated in Qiong Yao's TV series Courtyard Deep, Many Sunset Reds and Smoke and Rain. In 1990, when Liu Xuehua filmed ""Xue Ke"" in Chengde, Liu Dekai chased to Chengde, and it was reported that Liu and Liu got married locally. Gu Yinyin confirmed that the wedding ceremony was held in the form of a dinner table at that time, and Liu Dekai invited Liu Xuehua to appease her. When they returned to Taiwan, Liu Xuehua asked Liu Dekai when to register for marriage? Liu Dekai used the word ""drag"" again, which made her very sad. Gu Yin, the wife of Liu Dekai's ex wife Wang Jingping, was a good sister. She said that everyone thought Liu Dekai and Wang Jingping had divorced, but in fact, they didn't. He told Liu Xuehua that he was divorced, and Liu Xuehua, who was in the dark, didn't know that she had been a third party for many years. Later, he obtained a green card because Wang Jingping was an American citizen, and he quickly married his French girlfriend Angel after his divorce. Gu Yinyin said that at that time, she and a group of good friends, such as Zhao Yongxin and Li Lifeng, were at Liu Xuehua's home, accompanying her to cry. Denying the pure炒作of gold aid was a past legend. Liu Dekai not only once took the initiative to Liu Xuehua, and she was determined to break up, but Liu Dekai would not let go. Gu Yinyin said: ""At that time, Xuehua was very popular and had a good income. Liu Dekai always wanted to be a producer and director, and to start his own business. Xuehua continued to support him with nearly 30 million (new Taiwan dollars). It's hard to divide money and feelings."" In the end, the two broke up and ended their six year love affair with Liu. She never heard Liu Xuehua mention whether Liu Dekai returned this money. Liu Dekai, who is filming in Yunnan, responded: ""It's been more than 10 years since that thing (marriage), and I don't want to talk about it again. My company is not my sole proprietorship.

西蒙开关拥有近百项专利12道品质保证SIMON西蒙电气自1999年来到中国，经历了近10年的风雨历程，最终凭借其稳健务实、团结创新的企业作风，在中国低压电气树立核心品牌地位，在九百六十万平方公里的土地上不断地续写着辉煌。可是谁又能想到一个小小的开关竟拥有近百项专利，而且还应用了如此之多的高科技创新技术，带着对这个的好奇心，记者来到了SIMON西蒙电气设立在江苏海安亚洲生产基地，采访了西蒙电气(中国)有限公司副总经理兼制造总监——黄海军先生，让我们对SIMON西蒙电气精湛的工艺、严谨的工作流程、不断创新的生产技术有了更新的认知。记者：黄总，您好！听说咱们西蒙电气自1916年在西班牙成立以来，经过九十多年的发展，在全球范围内完成了十几次的大规模成功收购，那能否告诉我们西蒙电气在世界各个国家的工厂布局情况是怎样的呢？黄总监：呵呵呵，我们西蒙电气在经过了近百年的发展，除了在西班牙本土拥有十几家工厂之外，在中国、印度、俄罗斯、法国、意大利，包括阿根廷、巴西、墨西哥灯十几个国家一共设立了二十几家公司，其中有12家是海外生产基地，目前中国是最大的海外生产基地和研发中心。产品涵盖了低压、电气附件、智能楼宇、照明电器、综合布线等十几个领域，销售网络也遍布了四大洲、五十多个国家和地区。记者：自1999年西蒙电气进入中国以来，听说西班牙总部在人力和物力方面都投入很大的精力用以打造世界标准的大型实验室和一流的科研队伍，是否可以阐述一下今天中国研发中心的前景和目标？黄总监：西蒙电气中国研发中心成立于2003年，到目前为止已经有了一定规模。中国研发中心的前景和目标主要体现在以下几个方面：第一个是实现全球化。去年，西蒙电气董事会在中国做了一些研究，认为无论从人才、产品与技术的发展来看，中国市场都比较强。确定了中国为西蒙电气的全球化提供研发方面的服务。第二个是使产品走向节能环保，和智能化的完整解决方案方向发展，为客户和用户提供一个整体化的解决方案，包括低压电器、综合布线、开关、灯具照明等。第三是我的个人期望，希望通过一段时间的努力，能够申请成为江苏省省级的研发中心，符合中国政策的前提下创建一个高水平的省级研发中心。记者：对于开关插座而言，一般大众消费者可能认为没有什么技术含量，不知您有什么建议？能否和我们简单的谈一谈西蒙在开关方面的一些技术创新吗？黄总监：当然可以啊！对大多消费者来说，可能真的认为开关插座没有什么高科技含金量。可是如果从专业制造角度来看的话，其实里面隐藏了很多不为人知的在秘密啊。比如：我们西蒙开关独特的无滑动翘板结构、儿童锁，以及高性能载流件等专利技术的应用能确保我们的开关插座较同类产品更加安全可靠。例如无滑动翘板的设计，能有效减灭电弧的产生，平常用户可能感觉不到明显差异，但在潮湿的环境下，例如厨房、卫生间，这种优势一下就体现出来了。我们西蒙产品，不仅在研发方面获得了近百项专利，同时在生产方面更有12道品质保证。我们的开关拨动次数在40000次以上、插座插拔次数达15000次以上，可正常使用12年，并通过了CCC认证，完全符合中国电器附件标准的。记者：由于目前市场上开关插座产品鱼龙混杂，您能否从专业角度教一下我们大众消费者应该如何正确选择开关插座呢？黄总监：乐意之至！首先要认真、仔细的看，看它的外观有没有光泽、褪不褪色、做工够不够精致；这还没完，还要看它的用料是不是通体PC料，因为这款用料具有强度高、阻燃性好等众多优点；其次是手感，一般用料好的开关，如使用优质的PC料和较好的内部铜件材料，开关插座的手感则较重；当你用手拨动时能感受到它的力度，轻巧不紧固、弹簧硬；而差的开关，它的弹簧较软、容易卡在中间，面板用手按起来有薄脆的感觉；最后是听，听它的声音节奏感是否强且轻脆。一般质量好的开关，声音比较明亮，相反，质量差的开关相对比较暗哑，拨动时声音不纯，中间会有间歇状态。记者：刚刚听您谈了好差开关的区别，好像最关键的原材料的使用选择，那对西蒙开关插座来说，我们对原料标准标准是如何制定的呢？黄总监：在产品原料的选择上我们秉承一贯的严谨作风。第一要求性能安全可靠，第二要求节能环保。现在最主要的两大材料，其一是塑料；其二是铜带。对原料供应商一方面要求安全可靠，更多的是对环境的责任和社会的责任。西蒙在对客户提供质量保证的同时也考虑到了对环境、社会的责任。记者：大家都说“先进的工艺、科学的流程才是质量的前提”。西蒙开关照明产品在工艺设计流程的管理和实施方面是如何保证质量的？黄总监：我们对产品工艺有这样几方面要求：一、规范的工艺流程；二、高效的生产方式；三、生产过程的稳定；四、可持续发展，不断持续改进。西蒙产品工艺的设计有一套严格的规范流程，这是西蒙生产体系的要求。为生产的流程、设备的配套、质量的过程控制等各个方面提供了整体的、系统的考虑。记者：我们也知道西蒙电气现在已拥有世界先进水平的专业设备，在行业里面走在最前端。除了引进国外设备外还自主研发出适用于西蒙开关插座生产的自动化装配线。能否对目前拥有的先进设备做一个简要的介绍？黄总监：主要生产线设备有如注塑机，主要是引进进口设备，配套自动化工具。除此外还有自己研发的设备，从2003年开始成立了一个部门专门研究自动化的生产设备。在开关插座的自动化生产方面，率先开发出一些大型自动化生产线，自动化改造的步伐一直在加速推进中。目前，西蒙电气独创自动装配线基本实现了全部塑料件、金属零件的自动上料、保护门组件安装、多轴锁螺丝、上下壳体的合拢等工序。这些自主研发自动化的生产设备有几个优点：第一、针对性，更能符合产品的生产特点。第二、紧迫性。现在强调柔性生产，西蒙开关品种约有4000个，引进不同的设备成本很高，自主研发也能更好解决这一问题。第三、可持续性。自主研究的设备可以应不同要求不断做出改进。在电子产品生产方面也有一些高性能自动化设备。西蒙对技术方面的投入在行业中来说都有很大的参考价值。记者：我们发现业内电子产品保质期为一年，但西蒙的电子产品保质期为两年，西蒙在质量控制上是否有远高于国家和行业检测标准的内控要求？黄总监：是的。业内的电子产品、家用电器的保质期一般为一年，一年之后修理需要付一定的成本，而西蒙可以保证两年之内给予无条件的维护。基于几个方面：一是系统的质量策划，包括产品设计及制造、采购的全部过程，通过质量策划，明确产品整个实现过程中的质量控制要点、方法及具体要求和控制计划；二是有一个高标准的实验室，拥有各种先进的检测设备，着重于对产品的质量分析、常规测试和监督检测，同时与相关国家行业检测机构保持良好沟通合作，以参与对相关行业技术标准的学习分析和修订，以确保SIMON电气产品在行业技术的领先性；三是整个生产过程的控制非常严格，各个环节的质量控制都严格管理。对重要的电子类产品，我们还记录保留每个产品出厂时的各项性能参数信息，以保证可追溯性，出现问题时可以及时准确的找到原因。记者：您也知道，现在LED灯已经成为开关照明行业的热点话题，相信西蒙电气在LED灯方面也会有大动作，不知黄总能否给我们透露一下西蒙在LED灯方面的情况？黄总监：西蒙电气(中国)对LED灯的研究已经开始了一两年，近期才开始推出产品。顺应国际化的潮流，去年建立了LED灯工厂，把LED灯作为了一个重要的研究方向。去年至今年期间，已经陆续研制出初期的产品，还未批量化的上市，从刚刚举行的年度经销商大会可以看出，常规传统的灯具如筒灯、吸顶灯、平板灯都推出了一些LED的产品，但西蒙在LED方面更多的体现在技术应用而不是技术研发上，公司将来会通过扩大研发团队来将LED研发作为一个主攻方向，推出更多的产品。	黄海军,黄总	正向	Simon Switch has nearly 100 patents and 12 quality assurance SIMON Simon Electric has been in China since 1999. After nearly 10 years of wind and rain, it has finally established a core brand position in China's low voltage electrical appliances with its stable and pragmatic, united and innovative corporate style, and has been writing a glorious chapter on the land of 9.6 million square kilometers. But who would have thought that a small switch actually has nearly 100 patents, and has also applied so many high-tech innovations. With curiosity about this, the reporter came to the Asian production base of SIMON Simon Electric in Haian, Jiangsu, and interviewed Mr. Huang Haijun, Vice President and Manufacturing Director of Simon Electric (China) Co., Ltd., which made us have a new understanding of Simon Simon Electric's exquisite technology, rigorous work process and innovative production technology. Reporter: Hello, President Huang! I heard that Simon Electric has completed a dozen large-scale successful acquisitions around the world after more than 90 years of development since its establishment in Spain in 1916. Can you tell us what the factory layout of Simon Electric in various countries in the world is like? Director Huang: Hehehe, after nearly a hundred years of development, we have had dozens of factories in Spain. In addition, we have set up dozens of companies in China, India, Russia, France, Italy, including Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and a dozen countries, 12 of which are overseas production bases. At present, China is the largest overseas production base and research and development center. The products cover more than a dozen fields, such as low voltage, electrical accessories, intelligent buildings, lighting electrical appliances, and comprehensive wiring. The sales network also covers four continents, more than 50 countries and regions. Reporter: Since Simon Electric entered China in 1999, I heard that the Spanish headquarters has invested a lot of energy in human and material resources to build a large laboratory and a first-class scientific research team of world standards. Can you explain the prospects and goals of today's Chinese Research and Development Center? Director Huang: The China Research and Development Center of Simon Electric was established in 2003, and it has been in a certain scale so far. The prospects and goals of the Chinese Research and Development Center are mainly reflected in the following aspects: the first is to achieve globalization. Last year, Simon Electric's board of directors did some research in China and believed that the Chinese market is relatively strong in terms of talents, products and technology development. It is determined that China will provide R & D services for the globalization of Simon Electric. The second is to make the product move towards the direction of energy saving, environmental protection and intelligent complete solution, and provide customers and users with an integrated solution, including low-voltage electrical appliances, integrated wiring, switches, lamps and lighting. The third is my personal expectation. I hope that after a period of efforts, I can apply to become a provincial R & D center in Jiangsu Province and create a high-level provincial R & D center under the premise of conforming to Chinese policies. Reporter: For switch sockets, the general public may think that there is no technology content. I wonder if you have any suggestions? Can you talk to us simply about Simon's technological innovation in switch
两名外籍援助人员在索马里中部遭绑架新华网摩加迪沙10月25日电(报道员瓦尔萨迈)索马里中部地区地方政府官员及当地一家非政府组织援助机构25日说，两名外籍援助人员当天在索中部遭不明身份武装分子绑架。这家机构工作人员对新华社报道员说，这两名来自丹麦一家非政府排雷机构的援助人员当天在索马里中部城镇加尔加尤附近地带被绑架，事发时两人正由加尔加尤镇南部前往当地机场途中。目前被绑人员的性别及国籍尚未确认。但有当地民众称，被绑人员为一男一女。另有一位不愿透露姓名的地方政府官员表示，被绑人员均为丹麦人。截至目前，尚无组织或个人声称对该事件负责。索马里自1991年政府被推翻后长期处于无政府状态。成立于2004年的过渡政府无力有效控制全国，中部及南部很多地区长期被反政府武装控制。2008年及2009年，索中部及南部曾发生多起外国援助人员被绑架事件。		负向	Two foreign aid workers were kidnapped in central Somalia Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, October 25 (reporter Walsami) Local government officials and a local non-governmental organization aid agency in central Somalia said on the 25th that two foreign aid workers were kidnapped by unidentified armed personnel in central Somalia on the same day. Staff of the agency told Xinhua reporters that the two aid workers from a Danish non-governmental demining organization were abducted in the vicinity of Garjiu, a town in central Somalia. At the time of the incident, the two people were on their way from the south of Garjiu Town to the local airport. The gender and nationality of the bound personnel have not been confirmed at present. But local people said that the bound people were a man and a woman. Another local government official who refused to reveal his name said that the bound people were all Danes. Up to now, no organization or individual has claimed responsibility for the incident. Somalia has been in a state of anarchy since the government was overthrown in 1991. The transitional government, founded in 2004, was unable to effectively control the country, and many areas in the central and southern regions have been controlled by anti government armed forces for a long time. In 2008 and 2009, there were several foreign aid workers who were kidnapped in the central and southern regions of Somalia.
国奥最后备战名单出炉申花6人入选成输出大户首席记者沈坤?在先后进行了四期集训，总共观察过41名球员的表现后，一份26人的国奥最后备战大名单已经于日前出炉。在这份名单中，申花队员几乎占了1/4的数目，参加上周为期三天飞行集训的6人全部入选。山东也是国奥球员的输出大户，共有4人榜上有名。在这26人中，有个别球员的入选让人颇感意外。其中包括伤别球场三个月之久，且此前从未参加过国奥集训的留洋球员张呈栋。而鲁能小将王彤也只是在第四期集训中随队参加了两堂训练课，他自己之前对于最终入选大名单完全不抱希望，连被选中参加上周的飞行集训都感到莫名，“这不因为买提他们都不能来嘛，派我做个代表，视察一下！”而效力于比利时色格拉俱乐部的汪洋因为在对韩国友谊赛上表现不佳，自己都怀疑会被剔除出队，最终他的名字还是出现在了这份名单中。在这26人中，有10名左右的球员已经提前锁定了主力，只有个别位置存在着一定变数，而主要的变数就存在于锋线和后腰。在这些“主力队员”中，申花球员几乎占去了半数。其中包括门将王大雷，后卫吴曦，中场宋博轩和曹?定。虽然曹?定只参加过第四期为期三天的集训，但是他在中前场的组织能力已经通过训练和比赛得到了主帅老布的认可。他在和东亚的热身赛上不仅为国奥打入一球，且传出了不少有威胁的好球，老布在赛后对他进行了表扬。而在这场前腰之争中，国安小将张稀哲最终失去了自己的位置，也因此落选最后的大名单。中锋仍然是国奥最薄弱的位置，布帅此次招入6名中锋，不仅带上了刚刚从长期伤病中恢复的张呈栋，连正在禁赛期的李凯也没有被嫌弃，可见这个位置的极度缺人。不过布帅表示，就用现在这批人，对付阿曼已经足够了。等到打完这轮淘汰赛，国奥还将继续大面积撒网，挑选新人。	沈坤,李凯,张呈栋,宋博轩,老布,王彤,王大雷,布帅,曹?定,吴曦,汪洋,张稀哲	正向	"The final preparation list of the national Olympic team has been released, and six people from Shenhua have been selected as the chief reporter Shen Kun? After four phases of training and a total observation of 41 players, a list of 26 people for the final preparation of the National Olympic Games has been released. In this list, the number of Shenhua players almost accounts for a quarter, and the six people who attended the three-day flight training last week were all selected. Shandong is also a major exporter of national Olympic players, with a total of 4 people on the list. Among these 26 people, the selection of some players was quite unexpected. This includes Zhang Chengdong, an overseas player who has been away from the stadium for three months and has never participated in the National Olympic training. Wang Tong, a young player of Luneng, only attended two training classes with the team in the fourth phase of training. He had no hope at all of being finally selected for the list, and he was inexplicable about being selected to participate in the flight training last week, ""Because they can't come, I sent me as a representative to have a look!"" While Wang Yang, who plays for Belgian Segra Club, doubted that he would be eliminated from the team because of his poor performance in the friendly match against South Korea, his name still appeared on the list. Among these 26 people, about 10 players have already locked the main force in advance, and there are only a few positions with certain variables, and the main variables exist in the forward line and the back waist. Among these ""main players"", Shenhua players almost occupy half of them. It includes Wang Dalai, a goalkeeper, Wu Xi, a defender, Song Boxuan, a midfielder, and Cao? Although Cao? Dinging only participated in the three-day training of the fourth phase, his organizational ability in the midfield has been recognized by the head coach Laobu through training and games. He not only scored a goal for the national Olympics in the warm-up match with East Asia, but also passed many threatening good balls. Laobu praised him after the match. However, in this battle of waist, Zhang Xizhe, a young player of Guoan, eventually lost his position, and thus missed the final list. The center forward is still the weakest position of the National Olympic Committee. This time, the coach Bush invited six centers, including Zhang Chengdong, who has just recovered from a long-term injury, and Li Kai, who is under suspension, is also welcome, which shows that this position is extremely short of people. However, Bush said that it was enough to deal with Oman with these people. After this round of elimination, the National Olympic Committee will continue to spread the net widely and select new people."

摩根大通将苹果第四季营收调高至187亿美元新浪科技讯北京时间10月7日晚间消息，据国外媒体报道，摩根大通分析师马克·莫斯科维茨(MarkMoskowitz)周四将苹果2010财年第四季度营收预期从181.3亿美元提高至187.1亿美元，并继续维持400美元的目标股价。莫斯科维茨预计，在截至9月30日的第四季度，苹果毛利率将达到39.5%，高于此前预期的39.2%，且有望于下个季度达到40%。而2011财年营收总额将达到815.3亿美元，高于此前预期的788.4亿美元，该数据并不包括Verizon版iPhone营收。当前有消息称，苹果最早将于2011年推出Verizon版iPhone。莫斯科维茨称，如果消息属实，那么Verizon版iPhone最多可使苹果每股摊薄收益提高2美元。莫斯科维茨认为，尽管许多厂商推出了自己的平板电脑，但苹果iPad的竞争力仍强于iPhone。摩根大通预计，苹果第四季度iPad销量将达到470万部，高于BernsteinResearch分析师科林·麦克格拉汉姆(ColinMcGranahan)预计的450万部。摩根大通称，平板电脑将在很大程度上蚕食上网本销量，但不会影响苹果Mac计算机销量。相反，莫斯科维茨还称，iPad有助于推动Mac销量。(李明)	马克·莫斯科维茨,李明,科林·麦克格拉汉姆	正向	JPMorgan Chase adjusted Apple's fourth quarter revenue to $18.7 billion Sina Technology News reported on the evening of Beijing time, October 7. According to foreign media reports, JPMorgan Chase analyst Mark Moskowitz raised Apple's fourth quarter revenue forecast of 2010 fiscal year from $18.13 billion to $18.71 billion on Thursday, and continued to maintain the target stock price of $400. Moskowitz expects that in the fourth quarter ending September 30, Apple's gross margin will reach 39.5%, higher than the previous expectation of 39.2%, and is expected to reach 40% in the next quarter. The total revenue in 2011 fiscal year will reach 81.53 billion US dollars, higher than the previous expectation of 78.84 billion US dollars. This figure does not include Verizon's iPhone revenue. There is news now that Apple will launch the Verizon iPhone as early as 2011. Moskowitz said that if the news is true, the Verizon iPhone could increase Apple's earnings per share by up to $2. Moskowitz believes that although many manufacturers have launched their own tablets, the competitiveness of Apple iPad is still stronger than that of iPhone. JPMorgan Chase expects Apple's iPad sales in the fourth quarter to reach 4.7 million units, higher than 4.5 million units expected by Colin McGranahan, an analyst at Bernstein Research. JPMorgan Chase said that tablet computers will largely erode the sales of netbooks, but will not affect the sales of Apple's Mac computer. On the contrary, Moskowitz also said that the iPad helps to promote Mac sales. (Li Ming)
妻子疑丈夫有外遇打车跟踪司机被丈夫当出气筒本报讯记者张祖珍、实习生朱沛东报道：怀疑丈夫有外遇，妻子打的士一路跟踪抓现行。追上之后，妻子对丈夫手撕牙咬，恼火的丈夫将怒气撒在妻子所乘的士的司机身上。昨日，省城洪城路与抚生路交叉口发生打架事件，引来多人围观。“说什么说，不是和你说了，这是我们的家事，你干吗还紧追着不放？”昨日中午，在洪城路与抚生路交叉口附近，一名衣衫不整的男子指着另一名男子激动地大吼，旁边还围着很多路人，两辆出租车停在现场。据路人林先生告诉记者，骂人的男子是一名出租车司机，刚和其妻打了一架。“他老婆好凶，冲上来又是扯衣服又是牙齿咬，男的衬衣被撕烂了，胸口露出一大片，肚子上也被抓花了。”据悉，夫妻俩之所以打架，是因为妻子怀疑丈夫有外遇。两个男人上演“全武行”，是因为丈夫将怒气撒到另一名出租车司机身上，责怪其载着他妻子全城追他。“我真是太冤枉了，那个女的上了我的车后说追前面的出租车。她说要追，我不就跟着追啊！”被当出气筒的出租车司机喊冤。原来，女子在红谷滩上了他的车后，要他追前面一辆出租车。于是，他一路追到南昌大桥，再追到洪城路、抚生路，沿着洪城大市场追了一圈后，最终在洪城路与抚生路交叉口追上了。追上之后，闹剧发生了。但他没想到，自己也被卷入其中，还挨了打，便立即报警。桃花派出所民警赶到现场，将双方带到派出所处理。	朱沛东,林先生,张祖珍	负向	"The wife suspected that her husband was having an affair and took a taxi to follow the driver. She was used as a punching bag by her husband. Zhang Zujun, a reporter, and Zhu Peidong, an intern, reported that the wife had a taxi to follow her husband because she suspected that he was having an affair. When she caught up with him, her wife tore and bit her teeth at her husband. The angry husband vented his anger on the driver of the taxi which his wife was taking. Yesterday, a fight at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road in the provincial capital drew a crowd of people. ""What's the matter? I've told you, this is our family affair. Why do you keep chasing me?"" Yesterday中午, at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road, a man in disheveled clothes pointed at another man and shouted excitedly. There were also many passers-by around him, and two taxis were parked at the scene. According to Mr. Lin, a passer-by, the man who scolded was a taxi driver who had just fought with his wife. ""His wife is so fierce. She rushed to tear her clothes and teeth. The man's shirt was torn and his chest was exposed. His stomach was also scratched."" It is reported that the reason why the couple fought is that the wife suspected that her husband had an affair. The reason why two men played ""all Wu Xing"" was that the husband vented his anger on another taxi driver and blamed him for carrying his wife to chase him all over the city. ""I'm really wronged. The woman said to follow the taxi in front of her after she got in my car. She said to follow me, so I just followed her!"" The taxi driver who was used as a scapegoat complained. It turned out that after the woman got on his car in Honggutan, she asked him to follow the taxi in front of him. As a result, he chased all the way to Nanchang Bridge, and then to Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road. After chasing around the Hongcheng Market, he finally caught up at the intersection of Hongcheng Road and Fusheng Road. After catching up, a farce occurred. But he didn't expect that he was also involved in it, and he was beaten, so he immediately called the police. The police officers of Taohua Police Station arrived at the scene and took both sides to the police station for disposal."
ESPN最新评奖火箭一人进步最快MVP榜新星超科比新浪体育讯　北京时间3月17日，ESPN专栏作家莫瑞斯-布鲁克斯更新了赛季各奖项的候选人排名，其中在最有价值球员奖的争夺名单中，勒布朗-詹姆斯依旧稳坐榜首，而休斯顿火箭队的阿隆-布鲁克斯有望与昔日队友卡尔-兰德里争夺进步最快球员奖，主教练里克-阿德尔曼则有机会染指年度最佳教练奖。1.勒布朗-詹姆斯(克里夫兰骑士队)2.凯文-杜兰特(俄克拉荷马雷霆队)假如这位年仅21岁的球员能够击败詹姆斯坐上得分榜的宝座，那么他将成为NBA历史上最年轻的得分王。3.科比-布莱恩特(洛杉矶湖人队)领袖才华也是获得最有价值球员奖的关键，事实是，科比在本赛季已经完成了7次绝杀。4.德克-诺维斯基(达拉斯小牛队)当小牛队取得13连胜后，我敢肯定人们绝对不会想到纽约尼克斯队会成为阻止他们连胜的首选球队，诺维斯基在这场比赛中贡献20分和12个篮板，但仍然无法弥补上半场出现的巨大劣势。5.卡梅罗-安东尼(丹佛掘金队)在个人拿下45分和10个篮板但最终输给休斯顿火箭队后，安东尼在本赛季已经有7场比赛得分超过40分。6.德怀特-霍华德(奥兰多魔术队)他的防守就像其他得分机器的进攻一样出色，照主教练斯坦-范甘迪的话说，霍华德可以在防守端影响到对手的每一次进攻。7.德隆-威廉姆斯(犹他爵士队)他本赛季已经取得了35次两双表现，其中包括最近6场比赛中完成了5次，而在本周击败华盛顿奇才队后，爵士队只落后掘金队2场而已。8.史蒂夫-纳什(菲尼克斯太阳队)昔日连续2个赛季获得MVP的纳什如今迎来了自己的第1000场比赛，尽管他的身体已经运行够久了，但他仍然打出了自己职业生涯中最出色的赛季之一。9.德怀恩-韦德(迈阿密热火队)在最近的一波6胜1负的战绩中，韦德场均贡献30.6分、7.9次助攻和5个篮板。10.布兰顿-罗伊(波特兰开拓者队)虽然因伤缺阵了14场比赛令他临时被排挤在10名之外，但他在复出后的表现好坏可能也难以反应在开拓者队的战绩中。进步最快球员奖1.阿隆-布鲁克斯(休斯顿火箭队)不知道火箭队的公关部有没有开始准备策划一些有关支持布鲁克斯当选进步最快球员奖的活动，但他在与掘金队比赛中的表现绝对是一个不错的开始。2.马克-加索尔(孟菲斯灰熊队)提起加索尔，则不得不提到扎克-兰多夫，不确定灰熊队的这两位大将是否愿意共同分享这一荣誉。3.卡尔-兰德里(萨克拉门托国王队)这位三年级球员在各项数据上都刷新了个人职业生涯新高。4.安德鲁-博古特(米尔沃基雄鹿队)这位刚当选东部周最佳球员的年轻中锋在本赛季已经取得了32次两双。5.约什-史密斯(亚特兰大老鹰队)他在上赛季的进步神速，那么有没有可能让一位心智上进步神速的球员当选进步最快球员奖？年度最佳防守球员1.德怀特-霍华德(奥兰多魔术队)我们都知道霍华德的优势是什么，当他在场上时，对手往往会放弃内线进攻。2.罗恩-阿泰斯特(洛杉矶湖人队)批评家称他的年纪有些大了，而且实力有点退步，但他仍旧是联盟中最优秀的外围防守球员。3.吉拉德-华莱士(夏洛特山猫队)当华莱士在场上时，他可能是联盟中最吝啬的防守者。4.安德鲁-博古特(米尔沃基雄鹿队)他是联盟中封盖榜排名第二的球员，也是进步最快球员奖的争夺者。5.约什-史密斯(亚特兰大老鹰队)和安德森-瓦莱乔(克里夫兰骑士队)凯尔特人队已经吃尽了瓦莱乔在防守上给他们带来的苦头。年度最佳教练1.斯考特-布鲁克斯(俄克拉荷马雷霆队)凭借着出色的防守，雷霆队已经取得了5连胜。2.斯科特-斯基尔斯(米尔沃基雄鹿队)他们如今已经比上赛季的总获胜场次多赢了2场。3.内特-麦克米兰(波特兰开拓者队)他的入选或许是因为开拓者队处在联盟中竞争最激烈的分区中。4.拉里-布朗(夏洛特山猫队)他所率领的球队已经取得6连胜，而本赛季在主场赢得了24场胜利也刷新了球会纪录，剩余的赛季中，山猫队只需再赢2场即可刷新单击获胜场次纪录。5.莱昂内尔-霍林斯(孟菲斯灰熊队)和里克-阿德尔曼(休斯顿火箭队)虽然两位教练所带领的球队都不太可能打入季后赛，但这两支赛季前不被看好的球队却取得了超过5成的胜率。(喜欢)	霍林斯,罗恩-阿泰斯特,安德鲁-博古特,科比,科比-布莱恩特,兰德里,德克-诺维斯基,罗恩,史蒂夫,斯科特-斯基尔斯,勒布朗-詹姆斯,里克,加索尔,斯科特,威廉姆斯,杜兰特,德隆-威廉姆斯,德怀特,阿隆,莫瑞斯,内特-麦克米兰,阿泰斯特,诺维斯基,纳什,布兰顿,霍华德,莫瑞斯-布鲁克斯,韦德,德隆,拉里-布朗,阿德尔曼,内特,凯文-杜兰特,约什,马克-加索尔,布莱恩特,莱昂内尔-霍林斯,斯基尔斯,布朗,里克-阿德尔曼,麦克米兰,阿隆-布鲁克斯,德克,安德鲁,德怀恩,安东尼,德怀恩-韦德,扎克-兰多夫,史密斯,史蒂夫-纳什,吉拉德-华莱士,凯文,华莱士,莱昂内尔,马克,卡尔-兰德里,斯考特-布鲁克斯,约什-史密斯,布兰顿-罗伊,扎克,罗伊,卡尔,吉拉德,博古特,布鲁克斯,德怀特-霍华德	正向	ESPN's latest award of the fastest growing MVP list in the Rockets exceeded Kobe Sina Sports News On March 17, Beijing time, Maurice Brooks, a columnist of ESPN, updated the candidate ranking of various awards in the season. LeBron James still稳sat on the top of the list of contenders for the Most Valuable Player Award, while Aaron Brooks of the Houston Rockets was expected to compete with his former teammate Carl Landry for the fastest growing player award, and coach Rick Adelman had the opportunity to win the annual best coach award. 1. LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers) 2. Kevin Durant (Oklahoma City Thunder) If this 21-year-old player can defeat James and sit on the top of the scoring list, he will become the youngest scoring champion in NBA history. 3. Kobe Bryant (Los Angeles Lakers) Leadership talent is also the key to winning the Most Valuable Player Award. The fact is that Kobe has completed seven kills in this season. 4. Dirk Nowitzki (Dallas Mavericks) When the Mavericks achieved 13 consecutive victories, I am sure that people would never think that the New York Knicks would be the first choice to stop their consecutive victories. Nowitzki contributed 20 points and 12 rebounds in this game, but it was still unable to make up for the huge disadvantage that appeared in the first half. 5. Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets) After scoring 45 points and 10 rebounds but eventually losing to the Houston Rockets, Anthony has scored more than 40 points in seven games this season. 6. Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic) His defense is as excellent as the offense of other scoring machines. As the head coach Stan Van Gundy said, Howard can affect the opponent's every attack on the defensive end. 7. Deron Williams (Utah Jazz) He has achieved 35 double figures this season, including 5 games in the last 6 games. After defeating the Washington Wizards this week, the Jazz team was only 2 games behind the Nuggets. 8. Steve Nash (Phoenix Suns) Nash, who once won the MVP for two consecutive seasons, has welcomed his 1000th game. Although his body has run long enough, he still played one of the best seasons in his career. 9. Dwyane Wade (Miami Heat) In the recent 6-1 loss, Wade contributed 30.6 points, 7.9 assists and 5 rebounds on average. 10. Brandon Roy (Portland Trail Blazers) Although his absence from 14 games due to injury has temporarily squeezed him out of the top 10, his performance after his return may also be difficult to reflect in the Trail Blazers' performance. The fastest growing player award 1. Aaron Brooks (Houston Rockets) I don't know whether the public relations department of the Rockets has started to prepare some activities to support Brooks' election as the fastest growing player, but his performance in the game with the Nuggets is definitely a good start. 2. Marc Gasol (Memphis Grizzlies) Speaking of Gasol, we have to mention Zach Randolph. I'm not sure whether the two generals of the Grizzlies are willing to share the honor. 3. Carl Landry (Sacramento Kings) The third year player has refreshed his career high in all data. 4. Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks) The young center who has just been elected the best player in the East this season has achieved 32 doubles. 5. Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks) His progress last season was rapid. Is it possible to let a player who has made rapid progress in his mind win the award of the fastest growing player? 1. Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic) We all know what Howard's advantage is. When he is on the court, the opponent often gives up the internal attack. 2. Ron Artest (Los Angeles Lakers) Critics say he is too old and a bit retrogressive, but he is still the best defensive player in the league. 3. Girard Wallace (Charlotte Bobcats) When Wallace is on the court, he may be the most stingy defender in the league. 4. Andrew Bogut (Milwaukee Bucks) He is the second player in the league's blocking list and the contender for the fastest growing player award. 5. Josh Smith (Atlanta Hawks) and Anderson Varejo (Cleveland Cavaliers) The Celtics have had enough of the pain that Varejo has brought to them in defense. 1. Scott Brooks (Oklahoma City Thunder) With excellent defense, the Thunder has won five consecutive victories. 2. Scott Skiles (Milwaukee Bucks) They have now won two more games than the total number of victories last season. 3. Nate McMillan (Portland Trail Blazers) His selection may be because the Trail Blazers are in the most competitive division of the league. 4. Larry Brown (Charlotte Bobcats) The team he leads has won six consecutive victories, and the 24 victories at home this season has also set a record for the team. In the remaining season, the Bobcats need to win only two more games to set a record for the number of single click victories. 5. Lionel Hollins (Memphis Grizzlies) and Rick Adelman (Houston Rockets) Although the teams led by the two coaches are unlikely to make the playoffs, the two teams that were not favored at the beginning of the season have won more than 50% of the games.

福建武夷山到广州南沙走进三省三大球场南游记对于我等好抽绿色鸦片的人，云游中国寻访高尔夫球场已经成为戒不掉的瘾。就像女人往往成群结队扎堆购物一样，打球的人也自有自己的小圈子。我和A君、老赵因为打球而结缘，也习惯性地在每年天气还不错时相约出游。夫子则是一块在网上侃球的球友，神交已久，一直未曾谋面。聊起四五月份这个晚春时节，正是去南方打高尔夫的绝佳时机。与诸君聊起此事，遂一拍即合。去南方打？到哪里打好呢？云南、广东、海南…处处都是不能割舍之地。几人一合计，干脆从东南到西南(后因某些原因未至西南)，来个四人版南游记。打球为主，赏景为辅，诚不快哉！于是定路线寻球场，用时6天，从起始点福建武夷山到终点广州南沙，走进三省三大球场，着着实实过了一次打球的瘾，也过了一回闲云野鹤般的逍遥生活。正是：东游以求仙，西游以礼佛，北游以齐物，南游以击球。第一站：武夷山风景处处皆风景第一个要去的球场就是武夷山风景高尔夫。这个球场，夫子去过，直夸不错。我只是多年前慕名去福地武夷旅游过，还没在那打过球。让我们感兴趣的是武夷山最近推出的商务击球超值礼包。住两晚、打两场球、送自助早餐等，一个人才一千多块。于是赶忙预订。4月25日晴初会午后，我和A君、老赵从所在城市起飞，云层很厚，看起来马上就要下雨了。约两小时抵达武夷山机场，天气大好，碧空如洗，山峦如聚。一下飞机就看到武夷山风景的工作人员拿着接机牌在出口候着，比较窝心。夫子的飞机晚点，我们等了他将近半小时。他有着北方汉子的爽朗，魁伟健壮，铁定是个大炮手。不过夫子就是夫子，一上车，就跟我分析起今年的球员锦标赛的阵容和形势来。说说笑笑间，我们来到武夷山风景高尔夫会所。大家都知道高尔夫人的怪癖。要打好一场球，先得选个舒服的场子。舒服的球场，最重要的当属会所入不入眼。武夷山风景据说有着五星级度假酒店配套会。站在会所举目四望，自己置身于群山的环抱中，白云近得几乎可以用手触摸到。会所与周围的自然美景比起来，是谦卑的。风格融合了闽北传统建筑和现代建筑风格，虽朴拙但并不平淡，“低调的华丽”。晚上，我们吃过中餐厅的农家特色菜，几个人坐在露台边品茶，边聊天，屋外树影扶疏，间或听到鸟鸣声，想着古人的“山中七日，人间千年”，心有戚戚。按照相对论的原理，在这样的地方生活一千年，估计都嫌时间短呢。4月26日晴论球第二天，我们起了个大早。吃过酒店提供的免费自助早餐，来到球场。由于福建本身球场不多，前来打球的人不少。订了早上8点的Tee-Time。我每次下场前有一个怪病：看到新鲜的球场会先在脑海里演练打球场景。这也许是我打球最需要提升的地方，不够从容淡定。来到发球台，照例来个开球前合影。环顾四周，这个场子风光脱俗，近景妩媚，远景辽阔。球童小丽告诉我们，武夷山风景是一个典型的山地球场。整个球场占地2480亩。但若细细观赏，你会发现山外有山。球场的外层就是武夷山最有名的自然景致——瑰丽雄奇的三十六峰和丰姿各异的九十九岩，站在发球台，所有的美景都能尽收眼底。我还在发愣，A君已经开始开球了。这支开球木是他的最新爱宠，TaylorMadeR9。今年3月TaylorMade推出的新款，据说是弹道控制技术和可调节重心技术完美融合，左右弹道调节可提升至75码，老将佩利最近在各个大赛中发挥稳定，曾对媒体盛赞这支杆功不可没。面对380码的球道，A君果然犹如佩利附体，发球不偏不倚，又准又快，表现堪比职业选手。打了前三洞后，我对武夷山风景的特点有了一定了解。都说无限风光在险峰，反过来讲，无数美丽风景也可怕。这是一个典型的山地球场，这也是一个真正用险奇自然打造的球场。球道依天然山谷的V造型而建，天然得近乎粗放，大起大落，没完没了的沙坑和湖泊，灌木障碍和丹霞地貌特有的红色突出岩石，每一样都说明它是匹烈马。不过哪个爱玩高尔夫的人不喜欢“驯马”呢？打到5号洞，一直表情严肃的夫子突然失笑，“我去年就在5号洞吃过亏，之前在网上看过攻略，觉得有把握，但是等真正上到发球台时，地势高风力大，一杆挥下去，力道过猛，直接发球出界了。重新站在这里，有点心理障碍。”5号球道确实很特别。球童说，这个球道发球台的地势很高，球道的落差接近50米，果岭周围分布中三块沙坑。远远看去“大珠小珠落玉盘”。5号洞以风景殊异而负有盛名，在发球台上我们看到大王峰，犹如一尊侧面横卧的睡美人。这次夫子吸取了教训，挥杆的时候颇有技巧，果然球在划过一道弧线后稳稳地停在了球道中，且离果岭距离正合适，他顺势一杆上果岭，然后再轻推入洞，球进了，以一记小鸟成功雪耻。全场18洞中，风景无处不在，惊险也无处不在。在这个吊诡的山地球场，几乎没有所谓的坦途。我们一面打，一面感叹这球场的段位不低。后九洞与前九大落差的风格完全不同。后九被山林相夹，几乎就是一个没有经过人工修饰的巨大山林屏障，对于球手的每一击都极具挑战性。其中尤以14号球道和16号球道令人畏惧。14号球道是一个左狗腿球道，还是一个双层果岭。整个球道分布着阔大的沙坑，难度大又充满挑战，低矮山林环抱着溪水芳草，处处都是让你无法提防的障碍，没有金刚钻，不敢揽这瓷器活。和14洞有异曲同工之妙的是16洞。与14号对称，它是一个右狗腿，也是球场最长的四杆洞，全场443码。果岭周围地势起伏不定，沙坑夹杂，湖面瀑布相伴，不仅能考验球手的基本功，更能比拼谋略。打球好几年，我已不是菜鸟。越是难打的洞，心态就越要平和。球刚一出手，我暗暗感觉不妙，果然，球顺着风劲一路狂飙，滚到了沙坑。沙坑边缘比较深，我救球丝毫找不到大师的潇洒劲，好不容易才灰头土脸地爬出来。筋疲力尽打完18洞，一看表已到了正午时间。回头一望，后面的球友还在挥汗作战，久经沙场的夫子擒了三鸟一鹰，打出+4。4月27日晴游溪本想下午再打一场，不过来了武夷山，不看风景太可惜。中餐过后，我们一行人酒足饭饱，来到九曲溪星村乘坐竹筏。都说不坐竹排，武夷白来。游九曲哪能不坐竹排？据说九曲溪的艄公是出了名的会讲掌故，错过他们就错过了武夷真正鲜活的民间文化。不过这边是有潜规则的。上了竹排，打点是必须的，要不然艄公不仅一言不发，还不给你们好脸色。为了下午的旅途能轻松点，我们一上筏子就马上给了这个姓肖的老艄公50块钱小费。“一溪贯群山，清浅萦九曲。溪边列岩岫，倒影浸寒绿”，肖师傅是专业级的，他一路娓娓道来：九曲溪发源于森林茂密的武夷山自然保护区，全长62.8公里。进入风景区的一段河流除自然弯曲外，还受多组岩层断裂方向控制，形成了独特的九曲回肠的自然奇观。9九曲溪水流清澈，水源充沛，水质达到国家地面水Ι类标准，住在这旁边的人，赛神仙。站在竹筏上，我们一路随着九曲溪蜿蜒自如，水贯山行，看溪水晶莹，可谓曲曲含异趣，湾湾藏佳景。武夷山人用竹筏作为交通工具1000多年的历史。我们问肖老师傅，现在的武夷山为什么还在使用这种比较原始的工具呢？肖师傅笑道，竹筏自有竹筏的妙用，它浮力大、吃水浅、船身轻便，转圜又极为灵活。他只要用一根竹篙，就可以自如控制任何局面。它可以平稳地漂过深潭，也可飞快地滑下浅滩；可以灵巧地避开突立中流的礁石，又可急剧地转弯。再说这样也比较环保。竹筏在九曲漂了近两个小时，终于抵达目的地——一曲武夷宫码头。要离开武夷山时，我们聊起球童介绍过的欢乐家庭包，商量着暑假时再一起带老婆孩子同来避暑。	佩利,A君,夫子,老赵,小丽,肖师傅	正向	"Fujian Wuyi Mountain to Guangzhou Nansha went into three provinces and three major golf courses in South China. For those of us who like to smoke green opium, wandering around China to visit golf courses has become an addiction that we can't get rid of. Just as women often gather in groups to shop, so do people who play golf have their own small circle. I met A Jun and Lao Zhao because of playing golf, and I was used to going out for a trip in the nice weather every year. Fuzi is a ball friend who talks about balls online. He has been friends with God for a long time and has never seen him. Talking about the late spring in April and May, it is the best time to go south to play golf. Talking about this with you, we agreed immediately. Go south to play? Where is a good place to play? Yunnan, Guangdong, Hainan... everywhere is an indispensable place. After a合计of several people, we simply went from southeast to southwest (later, we didn't go to southwest because of some reasons), and came to a four person version of South Tour. Play golf as the main thing, enjoy the scenery as the secondary thing, and be sincere! So we set out to find the golf course. It took 6 days to walk into three provinces and three major golf courses from the starting point of Wuyi Mountain, Fujian to the end point of Nansha, Guangzhou, and we really had a lot of fun playing golf, and we also had a leisurely life like clouds and wild cranes. It is true that the East Tour seeks immortals, the West Tour worships Buddha, the North Tour is equal to things, and the South Tour hits balls. First stop: Wuyi Mountain Scenic Spot is a scenic spot. The first golf course to go to is Wuyi Mountain Scenic Golf. Fuzi has been to this golf course and praised it. I just went to the famous Fudi Wuyi for tourism many years ago, and I haven't played golf there. What interests us is the latest business strike super-value gift package launched by Wuyi Mountain. Stay two nights, play two games and give away a self-service breakfast for more than 1000 people. So hurry up and make a reservation. On April 25, when it was sunny, I flew with Jun A and Lao Zhao from the city where I was. The clouds were very thick, and it seemed that it was going to rain soon. It was nearly two hours before we arrived at Wuyi Mountain Airport. The weather was great. The sky was like a wash and the mountains were like a gathering. As soon as I got off the plane, I saw the staff of Wuyi Mountain Scenic Spot holding the pick-up card at the exit, which was quite cozy. Fuzi's plane was late, and we waited for him for nearly half an hour. He is cheerful and sturdy, like a northerner. He must be a great artilleryman. But Fuzi is Fuzi. As soon as he got in the car, he analyzed the lineup and situation of this year's Players Championship with me. While talking and laughing, we came to Wuyi Mountain Scenic Golf Club. Everyone knows the eccentricities of golfers. In order to play a good game, we must first choose a comfortable venue. The most important thing for a comfortable golf course is the club. Wuyi Mountain Scenic Spot is said to have a five-star resort hotel supporting conference. Standing in the club and looking around, I was in the arms of the mountains, and the white clouds were almost touching with my hands. The club is humble compared with the surrounding natural beauty. The style integrates the traditional architecture of Northern Fujian and modern architectural styles. It is simple but not flat, ""low-key luxury"". In the evening, we had the farmhouse special dishes in the Chinese restaurant. Several people sat on the terrace to have tea and chat. The trees outside were sparse, and we occasionally heard birds singing. We thought of the ancients' ""seven days in the mountains, a thousand years in the world"", which was sad. According to the principle of relativity, living in such a place for a thousand years is estimated to be short of time. On April 26, it was sunny to talk about the ball. The second day, we got up early. After having the free buffet breakfast provided by the hotel, we came to the golf course. Because there are not many golf courses in Fujian itself, there are many people who come to play golf. Book a Tee Time at 8:00 a.m. I have an odd disease every time I go to the field: I see a new golf course and first practice the scene of playing in my mind. This may be the place where I need to improve most in playing golf. I am not calm enough. Coming to the tee, we took a group photo as usual before serving. Looking around, this court is extraordinary, with charming scenery in the near view and wide view in the distance. The caddie Xiaoli told us that Wuyi Mountain Scenic Spot is a typical mountain golf course. The whole golf course covers an area of 2480 mu. But if you look carefully, you will find mountains beyond mountains. The outer layer of the golf course is the most famous natural scenery of Wuyi Mountain - the magnificent and magnificent thirty six peaks and the ninety nine rocks with different styles. Standing on the tee, all the beautiful scenery can be seen at a glance. I was still in a daze, and Jun A had begun to serve. This tee is his latest favorite, TaylorMadeR9. Launched by TaylorMade in March this year, it is said that the ballistic control technology and adjustable center of gravity technology are perfectly integrated, and the left and right ballistic adjustment can be increased to 75 yards. The veteran Perry has been stable in various major events recently, and the media has praised this rod for his credit. Facing the 380 yard fairway, Jun A was really like a Perei. He served without deviation, fast and accurate, and his performance was comparable to that of a professional player. After playing the first three holes, I have some understanding of the characteristics of Wuyi Mountain Scenic Spot. It is said that there are无限scenery in the dangerous peak, and conversely, countless beautiful scenery is also terrible. This is a typical mountain golf course, and this is a golf course that is really built with dangerous and strange nature. The fairway is built according to the V shape of the natural valley, which is almost coarse and extensive, with ups and downs, endless bunkers and lakes, shrub obstacles and the characteristic red prominent rocks of Danxia landform. Every one of them shows that it is a wild horse. But which golf lover doesn't like ""horse taming""? When you get to the fifth hole, Fuzi, who has been serious, suddenly laughs, ""I lost money in the fifth hole last year. I saw the strategy online before, and I thought I had a chance. But when I really get on the tee, the terrain is high and the wind is strong. I swing my rod down, and the force is too strong, so I directly serve out of bounds. Standing here again, there is some psychological barrier."" The fifth fairway is really special. The caddie said that the terrain of the tee of this fairway is very high, the drop of the fairway is nearly 50 meters, and there are three bunkers distributed around the green. Looking far away, ""the small beads fall on the jade plate"". The fifth hole is famous for its special scenery. On the tee, we saw the King Peak, like a sleeping beauty lying on its side. This time, Fuzi learned from the lesson. When swinging, he was quite skillful. Sure enough, the ball stopped steadily in the fairway after drawing an arc, and the distance from the green was just right.

小雨缓解美国旱情我国西南可能秋旱美国初霜冻影响有限，中西部地区迎小雨上周，受热带风暴Lee的影响，美国三角洲地区、东南棉区和东北部地区先后出现大到暴雨，有利于缓解当地旱情。但对于三角洲地区的大豆来说，这场降雨来得过晚，反而不利收割。美国中南、东南棉区的棉花采摘工作亦中断。美国中西部地区依然降水稀少，伊利诺伊州、印第安纳州累积降水量不足25毫米，只有偏东部的俄亥俄州、肯塔基州雨水较多。气温方面，上周美国中部平原和中西部地区降温明显，上述地区平均气温较常年偏低约4—6℃，不过中西部地区的气温多维持在白天24℃、夜间10℃左右，并未出现初霜冻。美国9月5—12日累积降水量实况图本周，美国中西部地区天气基本良好，虽然局部可能出现霜冻，但是预计影响不大。受冷空气影响，美国由中北至东南出现一轮降温过程，预计14—15日夜间北达科他州、明尼苏达州、威斯康辛州甚至爱荷华州局部可能出现初霜冻。由于玉米已基本成熟，故潜在霜冻威胁的主要是美国大豆产量。不过16日后，美国中西部地区将升温，升温有望持续至下周一，且中期预报认为9月18—22日美国北方大部气温较常年偏高。在降温的同时，美国中西部地区本周的降水概率亦将增大，土壤表墒改善利于大豆灌浆成熟。尽管天气以小雨为主，累积降水量不足以缓解旱情，但可遏制中西部地区旱情的发展。截至9月6日，全美的干旱面积在缩小，中西部地区的干旱面积继续小幅增加，但干旱程度基本维持中旱不变。预计在本周四USDA和NOAA联合发布的监测报告中，中西部地区的干旱形势可能依然不变。今年美国中西部地区前期土壤底墒良好，8月份才开始出现干旱，而且干旱面积和程度的发展速度不快，故这场干旱并不会对新作大豆造成严重影响。中国我国迎来”三秋大忙“，西南局部伏秋连旱进入9月，我国大部农业区迎来秋收、秋耕、秋播的”三秋大忙“。目前全国大部秋收作物发育期正常，预计能够正常腾茬，华北南部、黄淮部分地区可能略偏晚。冬麦和油菜产区大部气象条件利于秋播及冬小麦、油菜的生长，但部分地区的干旱可能影响农业生产。我国气象干旱监测首先，东北地区秋收天气基本良好，未来局部地区的霜冻对大豆、玉米、一季稻的产量影响轻微。9月上旬东北地区以晴为主，光照充足，虽然局部降水偏少以致出现气象干旱，但是大部农区土壤墒情适宜，利于作物灌浆和成熟；气温接近常年略偏低，旬末黑龙江北部林区和牧区出现初霜冻，但对粮食作物基本无影响。预计14日起，一股较强冷空气将自西北到东南先后影响我国大部分地区，其中华北北部、东北地区北部的部分地区降温幅度可超过10℃，15—18日黑龙江北部和西部的局部还将再次出现霜冻。降温将影响华北玉米、东北大豆、一季稻等秋收作物的灌浆和成熟速度，但由于主要农区并无霜冻，因此对产量的威胁有限。其次，北方冬麦区今年雨水充沛，土壤底墒良好，麦播形势较乐观。9月上旬北方冬麦区持续阴雨寡照，土壤偏湿，不利于前茬玉米、大豆的灌浆成熟和棉花的裂铃吐絮，腾茬期可能偏晚。不过土壤偏湿总比干旱令人欣慰，毕竟北方冬麦区入秋后雨水往往不多。预计18日以后我国华北、黄淮地区将恢复晴朗，配合排湿降渍，土壤过湿的问题可以缓解，冬小麦有望于9月下旬适时播种。最后，南方油菜产区形势分化，西南地区旱情持续。长江流域油菜产区大部土壤墒情适宜，利于油菜播种出苗，预计油菜将于9月中旬开始播种。而西南地区东南部自5月以来降水持续偏少，加之阶段性极端高温天气，截至9月12日四川东南部、重庆西部、云南东北部、贵州东部和西南部、湖南西部和广西东部部分地区存在轻至中度农业干旱。预计贵州东南部、重庆等地秋季降水依然偏少，未来可能出现伏秋连旱，不利于油菜适时播种。（作者单位：永安期货）		正向	"The light rain alleviates the drought in the United States. The southwest of China may have an autumn drought. The initial frost in the United States has a limited impact. Last week, the Midwest welcomed a light rain. Affected by Tropical Storm Lee, the Delta region, Southeast Cotton Area and Northeast China successively experienced heavy to heavy rain, which was conducive to alleviating the local drought. However, for soybeans in the Delta region, the rain came too late, but it was不利to harvest. Cotton picking in the cotton area of central South and Southeast of the United States was also interrupted. The Midwest of the United States still has little precipitation. The cumulative precipitation in Illinois and Indiana is less than 25mm, and only Ohio and Kentucky in the eastern part have more rain. In terms of temperature, last week, the central plain and Midwest of the United States experienced significant cooling. The average temperature in the above areas was about 4-6℃ lower than the year as a whole. However, the temperature in the Midwest mostly remained around 24℃ in the daytime and 10℃ at night, and there was no initial frost. The cumulative precipitation in the United States from September 5 to 12. This week, the weather in the central and western United States was basically good. Although local frost may occur, it is expected that the impact will not be great. Affected by the cold air, the United States has experienced a round of cooling from North China to Southeast China. It is expected that the local area of North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and even Iowa may experience initial frost on the night of 14-15. Since corn has basically matured, the potential frost threat is mainly the soybean production of the United States. However, after the 16th, the Midwest of the United States will warm up. The temperature is expected to continue to rise until next Monday, and the medium-range forecast shows that the temperature in most of the northern United States from September 18 to 22 is higher than the year as a whole. While cooling, the probability of precipitation in the central and western United States will also increase this week, and the improvement of soil surface moisture is conducive to the filling and maturation of soybeans. Although the weather is mainly light rain, the cumulative precipitation is not enough to alleviate the drought, but it can curb the development of the drought in the Midwest. As of September 6, the drought area in the United States was decreasing, and the drought area in the Midwest continued to increase slightly, but the drought level basically remained unchanged in the medium drought. It is expected that the drought situation in the Midwest may remain unchanged in the monitoring report jointly released by the USDA and NOAA on Thursday of this week. The soil moisture in the central and western United States was good in the early stage this year, and drought began to occur in August, and the development speed of drought area and degree was not fast, so the drought will not have a serious impact on the new soybeans. China welcomes ""three autumns and great busy"", and the drought in some areas in the southwest continues in September. In September, the majority of agricultural areas in China welcomed the ""three autumn harvests"" of autumn harvest, autumn farming and autumn sowing. At present, the development period of the main autumn crops in the country is normal, and it is expected that they can be normally reclaimed. The southern part of North China and the Huaihai region may be slightly late. The weather conditions in most of the winter wheat and rapeseed production areas are favorable for autumn sowing and the growth of winter wheat and rapeseed, but drought in some areas may affect agricultural production. China's meteorological drought monitoring shows that first, the autumn harvest weather in Northeast China is basically good, and the frost in the future local areas has a slight impact on the yield of soybeans, corn and single-season rice. In the first ten days of September, Northeast China was mainly sunny, with sufficient light. Although local precipitation was less, resulting in meteorological drought, the soil moisture in most agricultural areas was suitable, which was conducive to the filling and maturation of crops; The temperature is slightly lower than the year as a whole. At the end of the month, the forestry and pastoral areas in northern Heilongjiang experienced initial frost, but it had little effect on food crops. It is expected that a strong cold air will affect most areas of China from northwest to southeast from the 14th, and some areas in North China and Northeast China will experience a temperature drop of more than 10℃. From the 15th to the 18th, there will be another frost in some local areas in North and West Heilongjiang. The cooling will affect the filling and maturation speed of autumn crops such as corn in North China, soybeans in Northeast China and single-season rice, but the threat to yield is limited because there is no frost in the main agricultural areas. Secondly, the winter wheat area in North China has abundant rain this year, and the soil moisture is good, so the wheat sowing situation is optimistic. In the first ten days of September, the winter wheat area in North China continued to have rainy and寡lit light, and the soil was too wet, which was not conducive to the filling and maturation of the corn and soybeans in the previous crop and the cracking and spitting of cotton. The crop rotation period may be late. However, it is always more reassuring that the soil is wetter than drought, after all, the rainfall in the North Winter Wheat Area is often not much after autumn. It is expected that the Huabei and Huaihai areas of China will recover from the 18th, and the wet soil problem can be alleviated with the drainage and wetting, and the winter wheat is expected to be sown at the right time in the late September. Finally, the situation in the southern rapeseed production area is divided, and the drought in the Southwest continues. The soil moisture in most of the rapeseed production areas in the Yangtze River Basin is suitable, which is conducive to rapeseed sowing and emergence. It is expected that rapeseed will begin sowing in mid September. However, since May, the Southeast Department of Southwest China has had continuous less precipitation, coupled with phased extreme high temperature weather, as of September 12, some areas in Southeast Sichuan, West Chongqing, Northeast Yunnan, East and Southwest Guizhou, West Hunan and East Guangxi have light to moderate agricultural drought. It is expected that the autumn rainfall in Southeast Guizhou, Chongqing and other places is still scarce, and the future伏autumn drought may occur, which is not conducive to timely sowing of rape.

They also said that these aliens are particularly interested in human nuclear weapons. According to these so-called ""alien witnesses"", aliens have often visited the earth for more than fifty years. According to their testimony, UFOs have appeared in the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Iran. Some people even claimed to have seen the wreckage of UFOs and living or dead aliens. A witness said that in 1967, when he was serving at an air force base in Montana, he saw a UFO fly to the base and stop in the air. At that time, all ten volunteer nuclear warheads of the base were ineffective. One month later, the UFO went again and the missile failed again. Their conclusion is that aliens are not malicious to the earth. However, they are concerned about the Earth's nuclear weapons and the Star Wars program."
30天令CBA升级名额巨变凤铝连投诉的机会都没有新赛季CBA出现第3支广东球队的可能性已变为0，广东凤铝铝材队在这场角逐中输给天津荣钢队，彻底无缘CBA.CBA联席会议曾在今年5月确定了2008-2009赛季CBA联赛的升级要件，主要是以今年NBL联赛成绩作为升级硬件指标，但昨日召开的联席会议上，却临时以投票形式进行公决，结果今年获NBL冠军的广东凤铝反被名次落在自己后面的天津和青岛压倒———16位CBA俱乐部总经理外加篮管中心联赛办公室经投票，天津以10票高居榜首，青岛获得6票，先前最热门的凤铝仅得到1票，得票最高的天津荣钢俱乐部就此荣升CBA.赴京出席了此次联席会议的凤铝俱乐部常务副总经理肖青龙称，俱乐部对这个结果已有所预见。据肖青龙透露，前日其赴京准备列席此次联席会议时，就有个别CBA俱乐部老总半开玩笑式地跟他讲：“你们凤铝(冲A)没戏了！”肖青龙称，这一情形当时即令其感觉不妙，随即也与大本营做过沟通，只是不想先前的传言竟在次日的联席会上一语成谶。记者电话采访凤铝队主教练王绪林时也得到这一印证，“我自己还有全体队员昨天都听说了我们队可能会升级无望的事。”电话中王绪林的失望之情清晰可感：“(今年)8月4日篮协来我们俱乐部进行CBA准入评估时，对我们各项软硬件都说满意，当时我还问过带队的(篮管中心党委书记)刘晓农和(CBA联赛办公室主任)张雄，他们都说我们升级没问题，谁知道还是闹了个现在这种结果。”虽然自8月1日起凤铝队就开始了集训，但队伍升级失利很可能会让这些来自五湖四海的队员们各奔东西。昨晚，身在俱乐部三水大本营的董事长吴小源听完前方的汇报后已经明确表态，接下来不排除凤铝撤资退出中国篮坛的可能性。	张雄,肖青龙,王绪林,吴小源,刘晓农	负向	"The 30-day order of CBA to upgrade the huge change of Feng Aluminum has no chance to complain. The possibility of the new season of CBA to have the third team in Guangdong has become 0. Guangdong Feng Aluminum lost to Tianjin Ronggang in the competition, completely missing the CBA. The CBA Coordinating Conference once determined in May this year that the upgrading requirement of the 2008-2009 CBA League was mainly based on the results of this year's NBL League as the hardware indicator for upgrading. However, at the Coordinating Conference held yesterday, a public referendum was temporarily held by voting. As a result, the Guangdong Feng Aluminum, which won the NBL championship this year, was overwhelmed by Tianjin and Qingdao, which fell behind itself - 16 general managers of CBA clubs plus the league office of the basketball management center voted. Tianjin topped the list with 10 votes, Qingdao got 6 votes, and Feng Aluminum, the most popular, only got 1 vote. The highest vote of Tianjin Ronggang Club was promoted to CBA. Xiao Qinglong, the vice general manager of the Feng Aluminum Club who attended the Coordinating Conference in Beijing, said that the Club had foreseen the result. According to Xiao Qinglong, when he went to Beijing yesterday to prepare for the Coordinating Conference, some CBA club presidents jokingly said to him: ""You have no play in Feng Aluminum (Chong A)!"" Xiao Qinglong said that this situation made him feel bad at that time, and he also communicated with the headquarters, but he didn't expect that the rumors would come true at the Coordinating Conference the next day. When the reporter interviewed Wang Xuliu, the head coach of Feng Aluminum Team, by telephone, he also got this confirmation. ""Yesterday, I and all the team members heard that our team might not be able to upgrade."" Wang Xuliu's disappointment was clearly felt in the telephone: ""(On August 4 this year), when the Basketball Association came to our club for CBA access evaluation, they said that we were satisfied with all the software and hardware. At that time, I also asked Liu Xiaonong (the party secretary of the Basketball Management Center) and Zhang Xiong (the director of the CBA League Office), who said that there was no problem with our upgrading. I didn't know that it was still a cause for the present result."" Although the Feng Aluminum Team has started training since August 1, the failure of the team to upgrade may let these players from all over the world go their separate ways. Last night, after listening to the report from the headquarters, the chairman of the board of directors, Wu Xiaoyuan, who was in the sanwaters headquarters of the club, has made it clear that the possibility of Feng Aluminum withdrawing from the Chinese basketball world is not excluded in the future."

梦八抵达上海安保更严格浦东机场获联盟高管盛赞记者沈知渝上海报道从彻夜不眠，灯火通宵的赌城澳门，“梦八”在两个小时以后，飞到了姚明的城市。这不再是弹丸之地，这里的人口，是澳门的30倍，黄浦江缓缓地流过城市的心脏，就像上海的血脉，给这座城市灌输着蕴秀灵气，东方明珠和城隍庙，浦东和浦西，贯通着千年文明。美国队的大个子们，还没机会去深入历史。最先映入眼帘的，是壮阔雄伟的浦东机场，而这也让他们惊叹，第一次来到中国的NBA公关主管布莱恩·麦克金农瞪着眼睛说：“机场真是太漂亮了，这个机场是新建的吗？”工作人员扮演球迷因为没有专机，只能搭乘商业客机，从澳门来上海。中午1点多，美国队登上上海航空FM818航班，直奔上海浦东。3点30分，飞机稳稳地降落在浦东国际机场。走出机舱，一眼看去，是浓浓的奥运气氛，五个福娃笑盈盈地看着这群大个子，北京奥运的标志，在过道上随处可见，霍华德大笑着说：“我真是非常兴奋。”比他们更兴奋的是机场的工作人员。在浦东机场，他们没有遇见球迷，没有看见标语，于是工作人员临时扮演了这个角色。当科比，詹姆斯，安东尼，韦德从他们面前鱼贯而过时，这些早有准备的工作人员放下了平日的矜持和严肃，跑着上去，和这些NBA的巨星们要求合影，要求签名。于是走了一大圈，满足了这些临时球迷的要求，美国队才跳上大巴，直扑下榻的波特曼酒店。一路上，大巴开过浦东宽阔平整的大道，收入眼帘的，尽是纽约芝加哥市中心一般的万丈高楼，他们啧啧地充满了惊叹。那些来过中国的，心里早有了数，上海是座怎样的城市，那些没来过中国的，置身于这样的繁华中，惊奇不已。45分钟，大巴抵达波特曼酒店。卸行李，领房卡，进房间，时针就慢慢走向了6点。可训练课还是没法省略，7点多，他们走下房间，上了大巴，开往静安体育馆。静安体育馆，其实就在波特曼酒店隔壁，可怎么也不能让美国队的大腕们走着过去，于是开车绕一圈，开进体育馆。这里头没有专业球迷，可也有临时的。穿着制服的警察，兴致勃勃地举着小相机，站在场边，对着使劲练投篮的美国队，摁下一回又一回，高兴地笑着。	布莱恩·麦克金农,科比,詹姆斯,霍华德,韦德,安东尼,沈知渝	正向	"The Dream Eight arrived in Shanghai with more stringent security. The Pu Dong Airport won praise from the league executives. Shen Zhiyu, a reporter in Shanghai, flew to Yao Ming's city from Macao, the gambling city that never sleeps all night. This is no longer a small place. The population here is 30 times that of Macao. The Huangpu River slowly flows through the heart of the city, like the blood pulse of Shanghai, injecting this city with the spirit of Gengxiu. The Oriental Pearl and the City God Temple, Pudong and Puxi, connect the millennium civilization. The big guys of the American team haven't had the chance to go deep into history. The first thing that came into view was the magnificent Pudong Airport, which also made them amazed. Brian McGranahan, the NBA public relations director who came to China for the first time, said with his eyes open: ""The airport is really beautiful. Is this airport newly built?"" Because there was no special plane, I had to take a commercial passenger plane from Macao to Shanghai. At more than 1:00 pm, the American team boarded the Shanghai Airlines FM818 flight straight to Shanghai Pudong. At 3:30, the plane landed steadily at the international airport in Pudong. When you get out of the cabin, you can see the strong Olympic atmosphere. Five lucky babies look at these big guys with a smile. The logo of the Beijing Olympic Games is everywhere in the corridor. Howard said with a big smile: ""I am really very excited."" The staff at the airport were more excited than they were. At the Pudong Airport, they didn't meet fans or see slogans, so the staff played this role temporarily. When Kobe, James, Anthony and Wade passed in front of them, these well-prepared staff put down their usual restraint and seriousness, ran up to them, and asked these NBA superstars for photos and autographs. So take a big circle to meet the requirements of these temporary fans, and then jump on the bus to the Portman Hotel where you are staying. All the way, the bus passes through the broad and flat avenue in Pudong, and what comes into your eyes is the tens of thousands of high-rise buildings in the center of New York and Chicago, which is amazing. Those who have been to China have had a lot in their minds, and Shanghai is a city. Those who have not been to China are amazing in such prosperity. 45 minutes later, the bus arrived at the Portman Hotel. Check in your luggage, get your room card, get into your room, and the hour hand slowly goes to 6 o'clock. But the training class can't be omitted. At 7:00, they get down from their room, get on the bus and go to the Jing'an Gymnasium. In fact, Jing'an Gymnasium is just next to Portman Hotel, but it is impossible to let the big names of the American team walk around, so they drive around and enter the gymnasium. There are no professional fans here, but there are temporary ones. The police in uniform held a small camera with great interest, stood at the court and pressed it again and again to the American team who were practicing shooting hard, and smiled happily."

Xunlei and Shengda Literature have both delayed their journey to the United States for IPO, and the first step of who will take the first step is also a matter of great concern to the market. (Reporter Suo Dongdong) Yesterday, it was reported that Tudou would land on the Nasdaq market in the next two days, with a planned financing of US $120 million. This is also the latest news since Tudou submitted its listing documents last November. The public relations department of Tudou said yesterday that it was inconvenient to comment on this matter. The slump of Chinese concept stocks in the earlier period made the industry exclaim that the window for going public in the United States has closed. Several industry insiders said they did not like the IPO of Tudou at this time. On the other hand, Tuojian Technology and Kaisai Biology have submitted IPO applications against the market, but because the market impact is small, it is also difficult to bear the heavy responsibility of opening a new listing window. Li Yan, CEO of Tudou com, told reporters that up to now, Tudou has not announced the issuance price range, and it is less likely to be listed in the near future. Previously, there was news that Tudou would postpone its IPO until November. But the analysis believes that the property dispute of Tudou CEO has just been solved, basically clearing the barriers for listing, and the competition pattern of video websites, the pursuit of venture capital and other factors may make it take listing as the first priority. Chinese video websites have Youku and Cool6 listed in the United States, and there are potatoes, Xunlei's Xunlei, PPS, etc. waiting in line. There are also iQiyi and Sogou Video in the field of genuine long videos. It is conceivable that the later listed enterprises will spend more energy telling their differences and advantages from the pioneers, and it is also more difficult to get recognition. In addition, as companies go public in the United States, the copyright issue has also been gradually taken seriously, and everyone is competing to spend huge funds to purchase content. Wang Wei, CEO of Tudou. com, said that Tudou. com will not reduce its investment in purchasing copyrights and providing content, and will establish industrial barriers in the field of original video UGC and self-made content. According to the data, as of March 31, 2011, Tudou. com had cash and cash equivalents of US $31.91 million, while Youku had US $253 million. Compared with the first line competitors, Youku has earned enough attention as the first Chinese video website to go public in the United States, and has relied on the IPO and additional issuance to reserve a large amount of funds. Sogou, Qiyi and other companies behind them have long-term support from their parent companies' funds and traffic. Heavyweight companies or breaking the window period of SDA Literature and Xunlei have delayed their IPO, saying that the current market conditions in the United States are poor and the value of the company can not be reflected. The general view outside is that the window period for Chinese enterprises to go public in the United States has closed and it is difficult to recover in the short term. However, venture capitalists believe that the listing of Youku and dangdang when they were very popular has also greatly increased people's overall expectations of Chinese concept stocks. At present, it is difficult to reproduce the high valuation premium of the earlier period, but it is not necessary to ""frighten the wind and crane"" for this reason. Recently, Tuojian Technology and Kaisai Biology have submitted listing applications to the SEC respectively. According to the data, Kaisai Biology is an industrial biological enterprise, and Tuojian Technology is developing electronic coupon business. Because of the low attention, it has not caused the market's attention. However, in the case of poor market conditions, the two companies set the issue price at more than US $12, with the financing scale reaching US $75 million and US $89.7 million, which made many investors lose their glasses."
罗志祥《潮男正传》改版发行创作粉丝之歌(图)新浪娱乐讯2008年底最受人注目的舞王传说专辑——罗志祥《潮男正传》抢手推出成绩惊人，旋即成为各大排行榜的冠军，包括各大唱片销售、网络及新媒体点播排行榜等冠军。适逢年底人气偶像相继出碟竞争激烈，罗志祥一路走来无畏风雨，更努力宣传为新片造势，为答谢各界替他撑腰打气，金牌大风决定在2009年的新春伊始顺势推出改版专辑，不仅超具诚意的推出双CD回馈大家的支持热情，还激送多项好礼，潮男巨型海报、【潮男明信片】等，超大尺寸豪华精装再一好礼，绝无仅有，叫人一定不能错过！！罗志祥第一次填词之作感人至深《为你写首歌》曾遭盗版外流除了专辑原有的玩转潮流10首新歌外，此次改版，罗志祥特别加赠一年一首创作之歌，邀请音乐才子好友曹格量身谱曲，加上他第一次个人亲笔创作歌词，表达内心最真实的情感，指定给一路支持着他、让他最疼爱的粉丝群们，因为无论何时何地他都能感受到被他们关爱呵护的温暖情意，希望能透过这首歌曲传达他的爱意，不需要言语只要哼起旋律，就能和罗志祥交流彼此最真挚的心灵。由于此前不法盗版商曾将这首歌曲放到网络上，公开进行免费的试听及下载，为了严惩这种不道德的行为，在《潮男正传》发行前夕，罗志祥忍痛割爱将此曲排除在专辑之外，堪称他2008年演艺事业最难过的遗珠了。此次《为你写首歌》收入改版专辑，罗志祥的愿望很简单，“以前我的歌迷一直说，我从来没有为他们写过歌，没想到专门写了一次，却碰上了盗版外流的情况，可是不管怎样，我想与歌迷心跟心在一起的感觉没变，而这种感情也是我很想唱出来的！”一次收藏潮男全套精彩造型罗志祥黑白琴键上演“金鸡独立”在上市期间创下了亮眼好成绩，销售热潮也因此延续到农历新年，疼爱粉丝的他特别向唱片公司恳求，在改版的产品能加入回馈大家的贴心赠品，因此本次改版特别加赠5张1套的实用【潮男明信片】及潮男巨型海报，将罗志祥此张专辑的精彩造型一次收藏，也因此让小猪在各大节目中更加卖力宣传，格外高调的告知全天下，这张专辑是他参与最多、投资创意最多的全新作品。颇具难度的改版专辑封面上，罗志祥脚尖踩在古董钢琴上，酷帅至极，封面刚一曝光，他便高呼“此照片决非数码合成”！原来这套全新造型来自于罗天王的灵感突现，唱片公司觉得非常不错便悉心采纳，没有想到真正拍摄起来却难度极大！罗志祥脚下的古董钢琴已经有一百多年的历史，需要特别呵护，而且要达到脚尖弹奏钢琴的创意效果，罗志祥必须要把全身的重心移至胸部以上，为了防止从钢琴掉下来造成的摔伤，唱片公司还特意做了不少的安全措施，来保证他的安全，从成品设计上已不难看出这套造型的难度，而讲求完美的罗天王在钢琴上反反复复摔了十几遍，才觉得满意，“其实每一遍拍摄都很辛苦，都非常累，虽然这个创意是我提出来的，可是真正要拍的时候，我还挺拒绝的，这个真的能拍出来吗？真正最后完成的时候，我还是挺感动的，看来世界上的事情只要勇于尝试，没有什么做不到的！”	曹格,罗志祥	正向	"The most popular dance king legend album at the end of 2008 - Luo Zhixiang's ""Tide Man's Biography"" - was launched with amazing results and immediately became the champion of various charts, including the champions of various record sales, online and new media on demand charts. Coinciding with the end of the year, popular idols launched one after another, and the competition was fierce. Luo Zhixiang was fearless on his way. He also publicized to create momentum for the new film. In order to thank everyone for supporting him, Goldwind decided to launch a revised album at the beginning of the New Year in 2009. It not only launched a dual CD with super sincerity to回馈 everyone's support enthusiasm, but also sent many gifts, such as huge posters of Chaonan, [Chaonan's postcard], ultra large luxury hardcover gift, unique, must not be missed!! Luo Zhixiang's first song to fill in the words was so moving that ""Write a Song for You"" was lost in addition to the 10 new songs of the original album that played around with the trend. This time, Luo Zhixiang gave a gift of one song a year, inviting his good friend Cao Ge, a music talent, to compose music for him, and he wrote lyrics for the first time to express his most true feelings, which were designated for the fans who have been supporting him and let him love them most. Because no matter when and where, he can feel their warmth and love, he hopes to convey his love through this song. There is no need to speak. Just hum the melody to communicate with Luo Zhixiang the most sincere soul. Because this song was once put on the Internet by an illegal pirate for free trial listening and download, in order to severely punish this immoral behavior, Luo Zhixiang had to give up this song when the ""Tide Man's Biography"" was released, which was the most regretful pearl of his 2008 acting career. This time, ""Write a Song for You"" was included in the revised album, and Luo Zhixiang's wish was very simple. ""In the past, my fans always said that I never wrote a song for them. I never thought that when I wrote a song for them, I met the situation of piracy. But anyway, I want to be together with the fans. The feeling of being with the fans has not changed, and this feeling is also what I really want to sing!"" Luo Zhixiang's black and white keyboard plays ""Jinji Independent"" in a set of wonderful styles of Chaonan, which has created a bright good result during the listing period, and the sales boom has also continued to the Spring Festival. He specially pleaded with the record company to include a set of 5 practical gifts of Chaonan's postcards and the huge poster of Chaonan in the revised product to give everyone a set of 5 practical gifts of Chaonan's postcards and the huge poster of Chaonan, which will collect the wonderful style of Luo Zhixiang's album at one time, so that the little pig can publicize more efforts in major programs, and he is particularly high-profile to tell the whole world that this album is his most new work in which he participates the most and invests the most creativity. On the difficult cover of the revised album, Luo Zhixiang's toe stepped on the antique piano, extremely cool. Just as soon as the cover was exposed, he shouted ""This photo is definitely not digital synthesis""! It turns out that the set of new shapes comes from the sudden inspiration of King Luo. The record company thought it was very good and carefully adopted it. However, it was extremely difficult to shoot! The antique piano under Luo Zhixiang's feet has a history of more than 100 years and needs special care. In order to achieve the creative effect of playing the piano with his toes, Luo Zhixiang must move the center of gravity of his body to above his chest. In order to prevent the injury caused by falling from the piano, the record company also took a lot of safety measures to ensure his safety. It is not difficult to see the difficulty of this set of shapes from the product design. The perfect King Luo fell on the piano again and again, and felt satisfied. ""In fact, every shooting is very hard and very tired. Although this idea was proposed by me, I was quite reluctant to shoot when it really came to shooting. Can this really be shot? When it was really completed in the end, I was still quite moved. It seems that as long as we are brave enough to try things in the world, there is nothing we can't do!"""

With the change of channels and consumption trends, the paint market has undergone profound changes. Carrie's grasps the pulse of the paint market and actively adjusts the marketing strategy. It has made considerable achievements in developing the project and furniture channels. It is reported that on August 17, Carrie's West Sales Department, Jiuquan Carrie's, has successfully opened a breakthrough in the engineering channel, winning the large order of all interior and exterior wall paints of five teaching buildings of Jiuquan Vocational and Technical College and the bid for all exterior wall paints of Hongyuan Community. In addition, all the interior wall paints of Jia Yu Guan City Library also adopted Carrie's paint; Carrie's fluorocarbon paint has entered the only five-star hotel in Zhaotong City, Yunnan Province - Jiangshan Grand Hotel. At the same time, the West Sales Department also actively intervenes in the local furniture factory. At present, Carrie's, Taiyuan, Shanxi, is preparing for the professional furniture paint flagship store of Carrie's, Taiyuan, to seize the local furniture paint market... All signs show that Carrie's is developing the engineering and furniture channels, and the development prospects are good. The paint market is relatively cold this year, and the market demand is also shrinking significantly, which is the feeling of most coating people. However, it is not really the case. It is possible that the shrinking is in a certain channel or some channels, and the shrinking part of the share is shifting to the engineering, furniture and other channels. As a whole, the market is still there, but the channels and consumption trends have changed a lot. Enterprises with strong market insight and sensitivity, relying on their own strength, will definitely have a promising future if they transform quickly. Carrie's paints have caught the change of market situation. At the Carrie's mid-year training conference in the second quarter of 2011, Zhang Wenhui, the general manager of Carrie's, proposed the profit doubling model of the three plus three viscous marketing of the Violet Avenue, and made it clear that the future focus of Carrie's will gradually shift to the development of the three dimensional channel, and the development of the engineering channel and the furniture channel will be regarded as the way for Carrie's to expand the channel, and a big battle will be fought. Previously, Carrie's has demonstrated its ability to expand channels. On August 2, Carrie's paint successfully won the bid for the interior wall decoration project of the Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi University of Traditional Chinese. On July 30, Carrie's successfully won the bid for the urban and rural reconstruction project of Huguan County, and the street buildings of Huguan County will all adopt Carrie's exterior wall paint. On July 29, the ""Bird's Nest"" Gymnasium in Jining City, Shandong Province decided to adopt Carrie's interior latex paint... At present, the engineering paint channel of Carrie's paint is rewriting the legend and creating a three-dimensional channel growth point. During this period, Carrie's furniture paint was also inferior. Relying on the cooperation with many world chemical giants, such as Rohm and Haas, Bayer, BASF and DuPont, to establish a good raw material and technical cooperation relationship, import environmental protection resin and other raw auxiliary materials, strong technical research and development capabilities, seven product technology advantages such as fully automatic production process, and seven support policies: product policy support, personnel support, service standards, special price system, interest subsidy, hardware support, training support, it has reached a strategic partnership with Yunge wooden door, Lianfa furniture, Anju Yan Kai furniture decoration, Baoxiang furniture, Bethlehem Furniture Co., Ltd., Changfu实木, Changsheng Furniture, Changhong Furniture, Changhong Furniture Factory, Dali Hua Furniture Co., Ltd., Dazhangzhuang Furniture, Dekang Furniture"
CPI重磅出炉农产品多数回落15日早盘国内商品走势较为分化，其中，农产品多数回落，唯棉花及白糖翻红，基金属及能源化工整体维持震荡偏多走势。CPI数据低于市场预期，紧缩政策预期下降，预计短期市场将延续震荡整理走势。国家统计局15日公布，1月份CPI同比上涨4.9%。环比上涨1.0%。1月份PPI同比上涨6.6%；环比上涨0.9%。对此，海通期货研究所所长郭洪钧表示，CPI数据出乎市场预料，低于市场预期，紧缩政策预期下降，利好股市。对于大宗商品走势的影响短期呈中性，长期来看属利好。不过，国家信息中心15日在一份报告中表示，作为抗击通货膨胀及遏制资产泡沫政策组合的一部分，中国央行年内很可能继续加息和上调存款准备金率。国家信息中心表示，为把好流动性总闸门，调整存款准备金率是中国央行的首选工具，并称，未来存款准备金率最高可能上调至23%左右。目前国内存款准备金率为19%。国家信息中心还称，未来央行继续加息势在必行，因为加息可以有效抑制资产价格泡沫。国家信息中心还表示，预计2011年人民币将继续逐步升值。2月15日在安徽粮食批发交易市场及其联网市场举行国家临时存储食用油竞价交易会，本次计划销售菜籽油99626吨，实际成交92759吨，成交率93.11%，成交均价9688元/吨。本次拍卖，成交率再次放大，成交均价也有较大升幅，上次1月18日菜油拍卖成交率89%，均价为9365元/吨。随着前期油脂市场期现价格的走高，菜油拍卖底价对市场具有吸引力较大。自2010年10月份至今，国家累计投放7批临储菜籽油，共计划销售89.4万吨，实际成交77.2万吨，成交量86.4%，有效增加市场油脂供应量。今日菜油拍卖成交良好，对期货盘面菜油价格形成支撑，走势强于豆油、棕榈油。大连玉米期货早盘维持高位整理，主力1109合约以2464元/吨开盘，收盘价2,459元/吨，下跌5元/吨。受隔夜国际玉米价格回落拖累，连玉米早盘维持整理。不过国内旱情忧虑及需求旺盛持续支撑价格，但高位抛压将加重，预计连玉米震荡料将加剧。豆油期货早盘震荡小跌，主力1109合约开盘10,792元/吨，收盘10,818元/吨，下跌22元/吨。隔夜美豆类期货出现高位调整行情，外盘对国内油脂市场提振作用削弱。不过，国内价格也低于进口成本价格抑制了国内油脂下跌空间。虽然市场上涨趋势仍未发生变化，但短期回调风险仍存。棕榈油期货早盘呈高位震荡。1109主力合约以10,088元/吨开盘，收盘10,118元/吨，下跌28元/吨。马来西亚棕榈油及美豆类期货均出现高位调整行情，外盘提振作用削弱。但在港口货源集中、进口成本与盘面价格倒挂严重影响下，期价较为抗跌。走势来看，目前上升形态保持完好，但由于缺乏新的推涨动力，多空资金在当前价位抗衡，存在一定的回调风险，但预计幅度不大。作者：科创信息王云汉	郭洪钧	正向	CPI released heavily, most agricultural products fell back. On the morning of the 15th, domestic commodity trends were relatively divergent. Among them, most agricultural products fell back, only cotton and white sugar turned red, and funds and energy chemicals maintained a trend of overall volatility. CPI data was lower than market expectations, and the expectation of tightening policy declined, it is expected that the short-term market will continue to consolidate volatility. The National Bureau of Statistics announced on the 15th that the CPI in January rose by 4.9% year on year. Ring ratio rose 1.0%. In January, PPI rose 6.6% year on year; Ring ratio rose 0.9%. Guo Hongjun, director of the Institute of Hedong Futures, said that the CPI data was unexpected and lower than expected, and the expectation of tightening policies declined, which was good for the stock market. The impact on the trend of bulk commodities is neutral in the short term and beneficial in the long term. However, the National Information Center said in a report on the 15th that the central bank of China is likely to continue to raise interest rates and the deposit reserve ratio this year as part of the policy package to combat inflation and curb asset bubbles. The National Information Center said that in order to control the total gate of liquidity well, adjusting the deposit reserve ratio is the first choice of the People's Bank of China, and it is called the future deposit reserve ratio, which can rise to about 23%. The current deposit reserve ratio in China is 19%. The National Information Center also said that the central bank must continue to raise interest rates in the future, because interest rate hikes can effectively curb asset price bubbles. The National Information Center also said that it is expected that the renminbi will continue to gradually appreciate in 2011. On February 15, the national temporary storage edible oil bidding and trading conference was held in Anhui Grain Wholesale Trading Market and its interconnected market. This planned sale of 99626 tons of rapeseed oil was 92759 tons, with a success rate of 93.11%, and the average price was 9688 yuan/ton. This auction again expanded the success rate, and the average transaction price also rose significantly. The success rate of the rapeseed oil auction on January 18 was 89%, with an average price of 9365 yuan/ton. With the rise of the forward oil market price, the rapeseed oil auction bottom price is attractive to the market. Since October 2010, the state has released a total of 7 batches of vegetable oil for temporary storage, with a total planned sales volume of 894000 tons, an actual sales volume of 772000 tons, and a trading volume of 86.4%, effectively increasing the market oil supply. Today's edible oil auction traded well, forming a support for the edible oil price of the futures market, and the trend is stronger than that of soybean oil and palm oil. Dalian corn futures maintained a high level of consolidation in the morning trading. The main contract of 1109 opened at 2464 yuan/ton and closed at 2459 yuan/ton, down 5 yuan/ton. Affected by the retreat of international corn prices overnight, the morning trading of corn for many days maintained consolidation. However, the domestic drought worries and strong demand continue to support the price, but the high throw pressure will increase, and it is expected that the volatility of even corn will intensify. Soybean oil futures fell slightly in the morning, opening at 10792 yuan/ton for the main contract of 1109 and closing at 10818 yuan/ton, down 22 yuan/ton. The overnight soybean futures in the United States showed a trend of high adjustment, and the external market weakened its role in boosting the domestic oil market. However, the domestic price is also lower than the import cost price, which curbs the decline of domestic oils. Although the rising trend of the market has not changed, there is still a risk of short-term adjustment. Palm oil futures opened high in the morning. The main contract of 1109 opened at 10088 yuan/ton and closed at 10118 yuan/ton, down 28 yuan/ton. Malaysian palm oil and US soybean futures have also shown a trend of high adjustment, and the role of the external market has weakened. However, under the serious impact of the port source concentration, import cost and the price of the market, the futures price is more anti falling. From the trend, the current upward trend is well maintained, but due to the lack of new promotional momentum, the long short funds are in confrontation at the current price, and there is a certain risk of adjustment, but it is expected that the magnitude will not be large.

Cathy, a good friend of HelloKitty, a Japanese cartoon character, was accused of infringing the copyright of Miffy, a Dutch cartoon character. The court in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, recently ruled that Mercis Media, the copyright owner of Miffy Rabbit, had won the case because Cathy Rabbit and Miffy Rabbit were too similar. The court ordered SanrioCo, the copyright owner of HelloKitty, to stop producing and selling Cathy Rabbit products in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, otherwise it would be fined 25000 euros per day. Sanrio was dissatisfied with the verdict, saying that it would consider appealing to prove that it did not infringe the plaintiff's rights. Miffy Rabbit was written by Dick Bruna, a Dutch illustration master, and was published in 1955. HelloKitty came out in 1974, and Cathy Rabbit appeared as a friend of HelloKitty in 1976.

Sina Games Exclusive Review: The concept of innovation has been emphasized in the development of online games, but there has been no substantial progress. The Magic God's Legend has put forward the slogan of ""micro innovation"", and made subtle adjustments different from the mainstream games in terms of career setting, skill release and client size. It remains to be seen whether these settings meet the player's consistent operation habits and experience, and whether they can meet the player's game needs. Sina Game News On June 1, the online game company of Sichuan Digital Publishing Media announced that a 2.5D war online game, The Magic God's Legend, will be launched in the near future. The game is based on the concept of micro innovation, launching a play of non cooling, non reading and three limited strong war careers. The game is expected to be closed for testing in summer. It is revealed that the Magic God's Legend launched by Sky Online this time creates a 2.5D game picture with a 3D engine, and it is said that it is easier for players to get started while ensuring the quality of the picture. The game emphasizes PK combat. All skills are released instantly, without cooling or reading. Drugs return instantly without delay. When the game is launched, it will feature faction confrontation, PK competitions, guild battlefields and national wars to highlight the combat experience. According to the official introduction, The Magic God's Legend focuses on the production concept of ""micro innovation"". In addition to the setting of instant skill release, the game also differs from the traditional multi career setting when setting up careers. The Magic God's Legend abandoned the useless career and only adopted three strong war careers - war, law and archery - in order to highlight the status and characteristics of each career, and did not set up chicken ribs roles. It is reported that The Magic God's Legend will launch a hundred megabyte client to enhance the experience of players. The game is expected to start the first technical beta test this summer.

传加护亚依签约拍AV作品昔日早安少女麻烦不断新浪娱乐讯9月30日消息，据日本八卦周刊爆料，原早安少女成员加护亚依将以5部作品一亿日元(约合835万元人民币)的价格出演AV作品。加护亚依九月中旬传出自杀未遂，有消息指自杀是因其圈外男友被捕。加护近期可谓是衰事连连。爆料该消息的《朝日艺能》周刊称，加护亚依与某家大的AV事务所签了拍摄合约，有消息指一亿日元是拍摄的预付款，也有传言称作品已经拍摄完毕，但从目前来看，如果连一部作品都还没开拍，事务所是不大可能提前支付预付款的，因此极有可能由加护亚依主演的AV作品已经拍摄完毕了。但该AV事务所在回应此事时称：“的确有这样的企划(指与加护亚依签约)，但还没有到签约的地步。”早前加护亚依同居男友因追债而犯下恐吓未遂罪被捕，几天后，传出她割腕并服用大量安眠药，所幸并未造成生命危险。关于加护亚依拍摄AV作品的消息一直都未曾断绝，去年曾传出她将和同为原早安少女成员的后藤真希拍摄AV的消息，但一直并无她的AV作品问世。加护七月份曾在推特上回应该消息时称：“怎么可能啊，笨蛋！”坚决否认了这种可能性。早安少女是日本当红组合，每一期的成员都曾有过当红时期，但近期关于原早安少女的种种负面消息却屡次见诸报端，除了加护亚依，后藤真希也是星路不顺，弟弟被捕、母亲自杀；吉泽瞳弟弟因车祸死亡；市井纱耶香离婚……麻烦不断的她们仿佛受到诅咒。（柳星张）	柳星张,加护亚依,市井纱耶香,吉泽瞳,后藤真希	负向	"It is reported that Jia Hu Ya Yi, a former member of Morning Girl, has signed a contract to shoot AV works, which has caused a lot of trouble. Sina Entertainment News On September 30, according to a Japanese gossip weekly, Jia Hu Ya Yi, a former member of Morning Girl, will star in AV works at a price of 100 million yen (about 8.35 million yuan) for five works. Jia Hu Ya Yi tried to commit suicide in mid September, and it was reported that the reason for his suicide was that his boyfriend outside the circle was arrested. Huo Huo can be described as a series of failures in recent days. The Asahi Art Weekly, which exposed the news, said that Jia Hu Ya Yi had signed a shooting contract with a major AV agency. It is reported that 100 million yen is a prepayment for shooting, and there is also a rumor that the shooting has been completed. But from the current situation, if even a work has not been started, it is unlikely that the agency will pay a prepayment in advance, so it is very likely that the AV works starring Jia Hu Ya Yi have been completed. But the AV agency responded to this by saying: ""There is indeed such a project (referring to the contract with Jia Hu Ya Yi), but it has not reached the stage of signing a contract."" Earlier, Jia Hu Ya Yi's cohabiting boyfriend was arrested for debt collection and attempted blackmail. A few days later, it was reported that she had cut her wrist and taken a large number of sleeping pills, fortunately, there was no danger to her life. The news that Jia Hu Ya Yi shot AV works has never stopped. Last year, it was reported that she would shoot AV with Goto Tomo, who was also a member of the former Morning Girl, but there has been no AV works of her. Jia Hu Ya Yi once responded on Twitter in July that: ""How can it be, fool!"" Firmly denied the possibility. Morning Girl is a popular combination in Japan. Every member has had a popular period, but recently, all kinds of negative news about the former Morning Girl has repeatedly appeared in the media. In addition to Jia Hu Ya Yi, Goto Tomo is also unlucky. His brother was arrested and his mother committed suicide; Jize Tong's brother died in a car accident; Shi Jing Sa Ya Xiang divorced... They are cursed with endless troubles. (Liu Xingzhang)"
上海经销商昨“拒卖诺基亚”东方早报记者周玲诺基亚回应：与“窜货商”无合同关系昨天，在上海火车站附近的地平线通信大楼内，被诺基亚公司称为“窜货商”(没有跟诺基亚签合同的三级经销商)的上海部分经销商，拉起“拒卖诺基亚”的横幅。记者获悉，此次抗议活动没有得到一家诺基亚正规经销商出面支持，显得有点势单力薄，声势不是很大。事实上，昨日的抗议横幅挂出不久后便被物业保安取下，早报记者现场也被禁止拍照，气氛紧张。一位经销商昨天对记者表示，挂出来已经是一种姿态，现在还没有完全停止销售诺基亚产品，但下一步会逐渐减少诺基亚产品销售。但一位参与抗议的经销商老板昨天对记者抱怨，济南等地的经销商抗议都得到了诺基亚正规经销商的支持，但是上海由于诺基亚施压，这些正规经销商没有一家出面力挺抗议。所谓正规经销商是指与诺基亚签订合同的代理商。按照诺基亚的渠道管理模式，一级为区域总代(简称FD)，FD下面是二级发展代理商(简称WKA)，WKA自己则会发展没有合同关系的小经销商，也被诺基亚称为“窜货商”。针对因诺基亚重罚“窜货”而引起的各地小经销商近期频繁抗议活动，诺基亚日前发布官方声明，称这些“窜货商”和诺基亚没有任何合同关系，也没有买卖关系，所以诺基亚对其罚款更无从说起。据记者了解，诺基亚窜货的罚款流程确实是直接从给当地FD的返点中扣除罚款，但FD会把罚款再转嫁给WKA，而WKA卖货给“窜货商”之前已讲清楚，如果被诺基亚抓住，罚款损失完全由窜货商承担，真正被罚的还是小经销商。一位经销商昨天对记者表示，现在每台手机赚几元钱利润，有的甚至就赚2元，再遭受巨额罚款风险太大，已经有多家经销商转卖企业品牌。相关人士昨天对记者表示，接下来各地还会有各种各样针对诺基亚的抗议活动。	周玲	负向	"The Shanghai dealer yesterday ""refused to sell Nokia"" Dongzao reporter Zhou Ling Nokia responded: There is no contractual relationship with the ""rogue dealer"" Yesterday, in the Horizon Communications Building near Shanghai Railway Station, some Shanghai dealers who were called ""rogue dealers"" (third-level dealers who did not sign contracts with Nokia) put up the banner of ""Refuse to sell Nokia"". The reporter learned that the protest activity did not get the support of a Nokia regular dealer, which seemed a little weak and not very powerful. In fact, yesterday's protest banner was soon taken down by the property security guard, and the early reporters were also forbidden to take photos on the spot, which was very tense. A dealer said to the reporter yesterday that it was already a gesture to hang out. Now, the sales of Nokia products have not been completely stopped, but the sales of Nokia products will gradually decrease in the next step. However, a dealer boss who participated in the protest complained to reporters yesterday that the protests of dealers in Jinan and other places have won the support of Nokia's regular dealers, but Shanghai has not received any support from these regular dealers due to Nokia's pressure. The so-called regular dealer refers to the agent who signed a contract with Nokia. According to Nokia's channel management model, the primary channel is the regional general representative (FD for short), the secondary channel is the development agent (WKA for short) under FD, and WKA itself will develop small dealers without contractual relationship, which is also called ""rogue dealer"" by Nokia. In view of the recent frequent protests of small dealers in various places due to Nokia's severe punishment of ""rogue goods"", Nokia recently issued an official statement, saying that these ""rogue dealers"" have no contractual relationship with Nokia, nor do they have any trade relationship, so Nokia has nothing to do with fining them. According to the reporter, the process of Nokia's smuggling penalty is indeed to directly deduct the fine from the return points given to the local FD, but the FD will pass the fine on to the WKA, and the WKA has made it clear before selling goods to the ""rogue dealer"" that if it is caught by Nokia, the fine loss will be completely borne by the rogue dealer, and the small dealer is still the one who is really punished. A dealer said to the reporter yesterday that now each mobile phone earns a profit of several yuan, and some even earn 2 yuan. It is too risky to suffer huge fines. Many dealers have transferred their enterprise brands. Relevant people said to the reporter yesterday that there will still be various protests against Nokia in the next step."

The gypsum board adopts a special research and development formula, which can perfectly improve the anti deformation and anti sagging performance of the plate. South China is located in the southernmost part of our country, in the southeast coastal area of the Asian continent, with the characteristics of hot and rainy climate. In particular, with the arrival of the plum rain season, the air humidity is often more than 85%. For a long time in a humid environment, the strength of ordinary gypsum products will decrease and deformation is easy to occur after they absorb moisture and moisture. The new Long Brand dual defense gypsum board launched by Beixin Building Materials makes up for the defects of the previous gypsum boards, highlighting multiple advantages with quality. First of all, the most important feature of Long Brand Double Defense Gypsum Board is effective anti cracking. The dry wet deformation rate of fiber cement products is about 3%, while the expansion and contraction rate of the new Long Brand Double Defense Gypsum Board launched by Beixin Building Materials is less than 0.01%, which is more stable under the same conditions; The new product is equipped with Long Brand special joint filler and Long Brand special joint paper belt to form the Long Brand anti cracking system, providing all-round protection from board to system. Under the standardized construction application, it can ensure that there is no crack. The second biggest advantage of Long Brand Dual Defense Gypsum Board is to prevent depression. It is a special product for the southern region, targeting the characteristics of the humid environment in South China, and adopts a special research and development formula to change the crystalline state of gypsum board from needle crystals to block crystals, giving the plate good mechanical strength, significantly improving the overall strength, and effectively improving the anti deformation and anti sagging performance of the plate. Become the best product of professional creation and regional exclusivity. Thirdly, the fire resistance of the new product is better. Long Brand Gypsum Board contains 20% crystalline water and some free water. When it meets fire, the first thing is that the free water evaporates, which releases steam and absorbs a lot of heat, inhibiting the increase of the board surface temperature. When the flame temperature continues to rise, the crystalline water between molecules dehydrates, delaying the rise of temperature, and the fiber enhances the role of reinforcing bar at the same time, keeping the structure intact. According to the detection of professional institutions, the combustion performance of Long Brand Gypsum Board reaches level A2; Beixin Building Materials has a complete fire application system, which can meet the fire wall structure of 0.5-4 hours. In addition, the product is green and environmentally friendly. Beixin Building Materials has passed the ISO14001 environmental management system certification and the national environmental label product certification. Long Brand Dual Defense Gypsum Board does not contain asbestos and other harmful substances. Once the new gypsum board was launched, it was widely favored by customers. Technological innovation is the driving force for the continuous development of enterprises. Beixin Building Materials, as the pioneer of China's gypsum board industry and the leader of China's new building materials industry, has always promoted the continuous progress and leapfrog development of enterprises through technological innovation for 30 years. Every year, the company will spend huge funds to reward employees who have made outstanding contributions in technological innovation. By the end of 2009, Beixin Building Materials had applied for 701 patents and obtained 560 authorizations. For many years, the patent technology and patent reserves of independent intellectual property rights have ranked first in the national building materials industry. In the future, the company will continue to ""focus on customers and create customer value"", providing consumers with more new products and satisfactory services. (Shi Xin)"

The emerging cast pipe was the most eye-catching security时报journalist Zhu Jingfeng. As the semi-annual reports of listed companies were published one after another, the hidden heavy position stocks purchased or purchased by Wang Yawei, a well-known fund manager, in the second quarter were also exposed. Wang Yawei continues his unique stock picking idea. China's large-scale and China's Strategy often ""come in pairs"" and appear together in the top ten tradable shareholders of many listed companies. According to the statistics of Tianxiang Investment, as of August 5, the China Large盘or China Strategy managed by Wang Yawei has appeared in the top ten tradable shareholders of 9 listed companies. In addition to Zhongheng Group and Avic Real Estate, the other seven are new stocks that entered in the second quarter. Among them, the massive entry into the emerging cast pipe is Wang Yawei's masterpiece. The semi annual report of the emerging cast pipe shows that the China Large盘Selected shares nearly 8 million shares of the stock, ranking the eighth largest tradable shareholder, and the China Large盘Selected shares did not enter the top ten tradable shareholders of the stock at the end of the first quarter. The China Large盘Selected shares also did not hold the stock at the end of last year. Obviously, Wang Yawei made a massive intervention in the emerging cast pipe in the second quarter. Since July, Xinxing Cast Pipe has soared by 61.93%, and China Huaxuan has made a lot of profits in a short time. International sugar prices have recently performed well, hitting new highs in rebound after rebound. Wang Yawei was clairvoyant, and he got involved in the sugar industry listed company Gui Tang Shares in the second quarter in advance. According to the semi annual report of Guizhou Sugar Co., Ltd., four of the top ten tradable shareholders at the end of the second quarter were public funds, and they were all China Huaxuan funds, among which China Huaxuan Selection and China Huaxuan Strategy ranked the fourth largest tradable shareholders with 3 million and 1.5 million shares respectively, and China Huaxuan Industry and China Huaxuan Bonus ranked the second largest and the fifth largest tradable shareholders with 8.5 million and nearly 2 million shares respectively. At the end of the first quarter, there was only one fund shareholder, ICBC Selection, in the top ten tradable shareholders of Guizhou Sugar Industry, which shows that the four Huaxuan series funds collectively intervened in Guizhou Sugar Industry in the second quarter. Stimulated by the sharp rise of sugar prices, Guizhou Sugar, which performed poorly in the second quarter, has soared by 32.8% since July. The second quarter report of the fund shows that China Huaxuan made a huge increase in the two petrochemical stocks, Sinopec and Sinopec, in the second quarter, and another unpopular petrochemical stock, Daqing Huake, was also visited by China Huaxuan. Daqing Huake's semi annual report shows that at the end of the second quarter, Wang Yawei's China Selection and China Strategy managed two funds with 1.93 million shares and 1.2 million shares respectively, which was the first time that they entered its top ten tradable shareholders, and they were also the only fund shareholders in its top ten tradable shareholders. In addition to Daqing Huake, the two brother funds of China Selection and China Strategy also appeared in the top ten tradable shareholders of Lijiang Tourism, where China Large盘had nearly 2 million shares, ranking the second largest tradable shareholder, and China Strategy had 600000 shares, ranking the fifth largest tradable shareholder. The hundred billion fund Changsheng Tongqing, which was established on May 12, purchased 1.19 million shares, ranking the third largest floating shareholder.

对话奥沙利文：百米成绩9秒6斯诺克完美境界是什么本报记者李婷体坛：说到你的孩子，每次在外比赛会特别想他们吧？奥沙利文：那当然，他们就是我的心肝呀，我只要一离开家就会特别想念他们，不过他们现在还太小，女儿三岁，儿子只有一岁半，可能还不太能理解我的心情。体坛：那为什么不把孩子一起带来？奥沙利文：其实我向组委会方面申请过，但组委会没有同意。我后来想想，自己是来比赛的，所以安心一点也好。体坛：16岁时父亲入狱，让你失去了很多父爱，会不会让你希望给孩子更多父爱？奥沙利文：孩子的成长需要父母给予很多关怀和帮助，所以只要我有时间都会在家陪他们，不要以为我会很忙，其实我每天只练两三个小时的球，然后腾出更多时间给家人。不过他们现在还太小，不能一起玩，我最多和儿子踢足球。体坛：：听说你父亲前一段曾短暂出狱，能谈谈他吗？奥沙利文：他是个很积极的人，不管面对什么情况，都不会消沉，我想这是他影响我最大的一点。他一直很关注也很支持我，即便我们不能见面，他也会了解我的比赛情况，我们彼此并不会因为距离而疏远。过去我们只能通过电话或几个月才能见一次，我相信不久的将来我们又能重新在一起。体坛：听说你酷爱跑步也是受了父亲的影响？奥沙利文：小时候父亲每天都会跑步，我也跟着，后来我自己每天都跑10公里，现在我基本上每周跑六天，可以放松身心，也可以保持不错的精神状态，再有就是保持体型。我现在年纪大了，不跑肚子上会长肉的，(大笑)要不要给你秀一下我的腹肌？体坛：每周六天，那你不怕风吹日晒雨淋？奥沙利文：风雨还是挺怕，但太阳是我的最爱呀，你看我皮肤，怎么样？很光滑吧？告诉你，我用的就是“阳光牌”润肤霜，推荐给你。还是要多晒晒太阳啦，我们平时打斯诺克不见天日，跑步总算能让我沐浴阳光，当然得享受。体坛：百米成绩怎么样？最远一次又是跑了多远？奥沙利文：我百米成绩是9秒6哦，很快吧，(笑)我开玩笑啦，我百米差不多14秒，有点不好意思啊。最远我跑过一次25公里，应该是半程马拉松的距离了，用了一个半小时，平常10公里我最快纪录是34分钟。体坛：看你挺重视身材和形象，我知道你是个追求完美的人。奥沙利文：是的，完美状态，是我最希望达到的，我总会以这种要求来提醒自己，我知道这很难，所以我会下很大决心来面对。体坛：怎么理解完美？斯诺克中的完美是？奥沙利文：完美就是你从来不可能达到完美的境界，但你可以做到保持连续性的高水平。这适应于所有方面。不论你在哪方面持续达到高水平，你都是那方面具有支配地位的人。斯诺克中的完美一定是147分。当然，你不可能每次比赛都能获得147分，就像我刚才说的，完美本身是不存在的，而是一个不断追求的过程。我也不是完美的人，但我会以这个标准来要求自己。体坛：所以你经常开局打得不好，就容易放弃之后的比赛？奥沙利文：我的确想把每场球都打得完美，如果开局不顺，我就会觉得即使后面打得再好，赢下来，过程也不是我想要的，这会让我失去对比赛的兴趣，不过也不是经常吧，只是偶尔为之。体坛：我记得你这“偶尔”的一次发生在2006年英锦赛你与亨得利的比赛中。奥沙利文：哦，你还记得真清楚，我当时1比4落后，觉得没什么希望，与其打下去还不如早点结束，反正结果也能预见，我打完那局就放弃离开了。我也因此付出了代价，罚钱又扣分，也算是个经验教训，现在我应该是不会了。体坛：你知道，为了斯诺克的发展，国际台联做了很多改革，但效果都不太好。奥沙利文：我知道斯诺克的商业发展不顺利，但具体的，我不懂。这些和我也没太大关系，我不是沃克爵士，我只管打好自己的球。如果我是沃克爵士？哦，不，不可能的，我只是奥沙利文，只做奥沙利文该做的。体坛：那你能给斯诺克运动的发展一些建议吗？奥沙利文：那你付我咨询费吗？(笑)不过看在你送我礼物的份上，我可以免收你的咨询费，其实我的收费挺高的。不过说真的，这项运动的发展不是我能控制的。体坛：沃克爵士曾说会考虑将世锦赛搬到中国，你愿意在英国之外参加如此重大的比赛吗？奥沙利文：其实在哪都一样，只是看心情上能否适应。即便真是那样，我肯定会让自己适应的，别忘了，奥沙利文是追求完美的，就像你说的那样。体坛：你认为你为斯诺克带来了什么？奥沙利文：速度？激情？147？我喜欢人们在看斯诺克，谈论到球手时会说，“哦，那是奥沙利文，我最喜欢的球手，他能打147分。”我在这项运动中是顶尖的，这能引起关注，吸引大家关注斯诺克。体坛：年轻人想达到奥沙利文的成就，应该怎么做？奥沙利文：他们应该要学习很多高手。我建议他们多看亨得利、戴维斯这些选手的技术录像，多练习，要专注。我也是在学习其他高手的过程中成为今天的奥沙利文，我以前经常会把亨得利的比赛录下来反复看，反复学。体坛：中国现在有很多学斯诺克的小孩，他们都是退学来专门投身这项运动。奥沙利文：这样？我认为教育是很重要的。当然，如果一个孩子确实对任何事都没兴趣，只喜欢斯诺克，那只要他愿意，也可以一直练习。但此外，还是必须接触其他知识，这是平衡，必须要处理好。体坛：说说现在的经济危机吧，你在英国有什么感受？奥沙利文：是的，全球现在都在经历危机，英国应该比中国更严重，其实我觉得没必要太担心，想着经济危机会怎样，这也是世界发展的自然规律吧，就像人也会生病。关键是，经济危机就算带走我们的一些金钱，但带不走我们的精神，只要有信念，一切都会过去。体坛：你在伦敦也有些生意，经济危机有影响吗？奥沙利文：我做一些地产还有店铺，这方面我倒没有特别留意，影响肯定有，但还不算大。我唯一的“生意”还是斯诺克，没比赛的时候，我才会关心一下其他产业。体坛：你觉得在哪更受欢迎，中国还是英国？奥沙利文：英国，毕竟斯诺克在英国有很悠久的历史，很多人喜欢斯诺克，也懂斯诺克，而在中国，虽然也有很多球迷问我要签名合影，但我不知道他们怎么看待斯诺克，因为我没法和他们交流。体坛：你到过北京、上海，还去了别的中国城市，最喜欢哪里？奥沙利文：中国每个城市给人的感觉都不一样。上海很时髦，现在是国际大都市，我喜欢那里的建筑，很多元化。南京环境很不错。而北京是个迷人的地方，有太多惊奇，我想夏天时带孩子来看看。体坛：每次到北京，有特别想去的地方吗？奥沙利文：餐馆，那是我一定要去的。喜欢中国菜？哦不，我不是喜欢，我是热爱，我太热爱了！我每次来北京都会去酒店附近一些粤菜馆吃海鲜，我在家也会做海鲜给孩子们吃。不过要说最喜欢的，还是广州的早茶，每次去广州，我都会吃很多样的茶点，太精致了。说到这，到了午餐时间，奥沙利文喝完咖啡说：“昨晚我去附近一家粤菜餐厅，那里的清蒸鱼很好吃，我等会儿还要再来一条。”奥沙利文笑着准备回房间，刚走了两步，又扭头回来：“哦，我的好运小牛忘拿了，不知道它会不会助我拿到比赛的冠军？”	戴维斯,沃克爵士,李婷,奥沙利文,亨得利	正向	"Dialogue with O'Sullivan: 100 meter score 9.6 snooker perfect realm? Li Ting, a reporter of this newspaper, said: Speaking of your children, you must miss them especially when you are competing outside? O'Sullivan: Of course, they are my liver and gallbladder. I will miss them very much as long as I leave home. However, they are too young now. Their daughter is three years old and their son is only one and a half years old, so they may not understand my feelings. Sports: Then why not bring the children together? O'Sullivan: In fact, I applied to the organizing committee, but the organizing committee did not agree. Later, I thought that I came to compete, so it would be better to be safe. Sports: When my father went to prison at the age of 16, it made you lose a lot of father's love. Would you like to give your child more father's love? O'Sullivan: Children's growth requires parents to give a lot of care and help, so I will always stay with them at home when I have time. Don't think I will be very busy. In fact, I only practice two or three hours a day, and then give more time to my family. However, they are too young to play together. I can play football with my son at most. Sports: I heard that your father had been briefly released from prison for the time being. Can you talk about him? O'Sullivan: He is a very positive person. No matter what situation he faces, he will not be depressed. I think this is the most important point that has influenced me. He has always been very concerned about and supportive of me. Even if we can not meet, he will know about my game. We will not alienate each other because of distance. In the past, we could only talk on the phone or meet once in several months, I believe we can be together again in the near future. Sports: I heard that your father also influenced you in running? O'Sullivan: When I was a child, my father ran every day, so did I. Later, I ran 10 kilometers every day. Now, I basically run six days a week, which can relax my body and mind, and keep a good mental state. The other thing is to keep fit. Now that I am old, I will grow meat on my stomach if I don't run. (Laugh) Do you want to show off my abdominal muscles? Sports: Six days a week, are you afraid of wind, sun, rain and rain? O'Sullivan: I'm still afraid of wind and rain, but the sun is my favorite. Look at my skin. How about it? Very smooth? Let me tell you, I use ""Sun"" brand moisturizing cream, which I recommend to you. Still, we have to get more sun. We can't see the sun when we play snooker. Running can let me bask in the sun, so I must enjoy it. Sports: What about the 100 meter score? How far did you run the farthest time? O'Sullivan: My 100 meter score is 9.6 seconds. It's very fast, isn't it? (Laugh) I'm just kidding. My 100 meter run is almost 14 seconds, so I'm a bit embarrassed. The farthest I've run is 25 kilometers, which should be the distance of a half marathon. It took an hour and a half. Normally, my fastest record for 10 kilometers is 34 minutes. Sports: You pay great attention to your figure and image. I know you are a perfectionist. O'Sullivan: Yes, the perfect state is what I hope to achieve most. I will always remind myself of this requirement. I know it is very difficult, so I will make up my mind to face it. Sports: How to understand perfection? What is perfection in snooker? O'Sullivan: Perfection is a state that you will never achieve, but you can achieve continuous high levels. This is applicable to all aspects. No matter where you continue to achieve a high level, you are the dominant person in that aspect. The perfection of snooker must be 147 points. Of course, you can't get 147 points in every game, as I just said. Perfection itself does not exist, but it is a continuous process of pursuit. I am not perfect either, but I will require myself according to this standard. Sports: So you often play badly at the beginning of the game, and it is easy to give up the game later? O'Sullivan: I really want to make every game perfect. If the beginning is not smooth, I will feel that even if I win later, the process is not what I want, which will make me lose interest in the game. However, it is not always the case, just occasionally. Sports: I remember that your ""occasional"" event took place in your match with Hendley at the 2006 British Championships. O'Sullivan: Oh, you really remember clearly. I was 1-4 behind and thought there was no hope. Instead of going on, it was better to end early. Anyway, the result could be foreseen. When I finished that game, I gave up and left. I also paid a price for that, with both fines and scores deducted, which can also be regarded as an experience lesson. I don't think I will now. Sports: You know, in order to develop snooker, the International Table Tennis Federation has made many reforms, but they are not very effective. O'Sullivan: I know that the commercial development of snooker is not smooth, but I don't understand the specifics. These have little to do with me. I am not Sir Walker. I just want to play my own ball well. If I were Sir Walker? Oh no, it's impossible. I'm just O'Sullivan, just doing what O'Sullivan should do. Sports: Can you give some suggestions for the development of snooker? O'Sullivan: Will you pay me a consulting fee? (Laugh) But in view of the fact that you have sent me gifts, I can exempt you from the consulting fee. In fact, my charge is quite high. But to be serious, the development of this sport is beyond my control. Sports: Sir Walker once said that he would consider moving the World Championships to China. Are you willing to participate in such a major event outside the United Kingdom? O'Sullivan: It's the same anywhere, just to see if you can adapt. Even if it is really like that, I will definitely make myself adapt. Don't forget, O'Sullivan is perfect, just as you said. Sports: What do you think you have brought to snooker? O'Sullivan: Speed? Passion? 147? I like people to say when they watch snooker and talk about players,"" Oh, that's O'Sullivan, my favorite player. He can play 147."" I am the best in this sport, which can attract attention and make everyone pay attention to snooker. Sports: What should young people do if they want to achieve O'Sullivan's success? O'Sullivan: They should learn from many experts. I suggest them to watch the technical videos of Hendley, Davis and other players, practice more, and focus. I also became today's O'Sullivan in the process of learning from other experts. I used to record Hendley's games and learn again and again. Sports: There are many children in China who are learning snooker. They all drop out of school to devote themselves to this sport. O'Sullivan: Like this? I think education is very important. Of course, if a child is really not interested in anything but snooker, he can also practice as long as he is willing. But in addition, we must have access to other knowledge. This is a balance and must be handled well. Sports: Talk about the current economic crisis. What do you feel in the UK? O'Sullivan: Yes, the world is now experiencing a crisis. The United Kingdom should be more serious than China. In fact, I don't think there is any need to worry too much. I think it is also the natural law of world development, just like people will get sick. The key is that even if the economic crisis takes away some of our money, it can't take away our spirit. As long as we have faith, everything will pass. Sports: You also have some businesses in London. Has the economic crisis had an impact? O'Sullivan: I do some real estate and shops. I didn't pay special attention to this aspect. There is definitely an impact, but it is not big. My only ""business"" is still snooker. When there is no game, I will care about other industries. Sports: Where do you think you are more popular, China or the United Kingdom? O'Sullivan: The United Kingdom. After all, snooker has a long history in the UK. Many people like snooker and know snooker. In China, although many fans also asked me for my signature and photo, I don't know how they view snooker because I can't communicate with them. Sports: You have been to Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese cities. Which one do you like best? O'Sullivan: Every city in China feels different. Shanghai is very fashionable. Now it is an international metropolis. I like the architecture there. It is very diversified. The environment in Nanjing is very nice. And Beijing is a fascinating place. There are too many surprises. I want to bring my children to have a look in summer. Sports: When you come to Beijing every time, do you want to go somewhere in particular? O'Sullivan: Restaurant, that's where I must go. Like Chinese food? Oh no, I don't like it. I love it. I love it too much! Every time I come to Beijing, I go to some Guangdong restaurants near the hotel to eat seafood, and I also cook seafood for my children at home. But to say the favorite, it is still the morning tea in Guangzhou. Every time I go to Guangzhou, I eat many kinds of dim sum."

纽约政府停购瓶装水【新华社北京5月6日电】为节省开支和遏制全球变暖，美国纽约州政府5日发布行政命令，所有州政府机构办公室将不再购买瓶装水供工作人员饮用。据美联社报道，纽约州州长戴维·帕特森在新闻发布会上指出：“纳税人已花了几十亿美元以确保我们的洁净饮用水供应。我们投入如此巨资，就当受其惠和用其水。”州长办公室列举数据说，美国每年生产塑料水瓶要消耗1700万桶石油，排放250万多吨二氧化碳。至于新措施能节省多少公款，州长办公室表示，由于州府各部门一直各自买水，一时还不能马上统计清楚。	戴维·帕特森	正向	"The New York government stopped purchasing bottled water [Xinhua Beijing, May 6] In order to save money and curb global warming, the New York State Government of the United States issued an administrative order on the 5th that all state government agencies' offices will no longer purchase bottled water for staff to drink. According to the Associated Press, New York Governor David Paterson pointed out at the press conference: ""Taxpayers have spent tens of billions of dollars to ensure our clean water supply. We have invested so much money that we should benefit from it and use its water."" The governor's office listed data that shows the United States consumes 17 million barrels of oil and emits more than 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide every year to produce plastic water bottles. As for how much public money the new measure can save, the governor's office said that it could not immediately count because the departments of the state government had always bought water on their own."

德国司机驾着达拉斯的梦宿命对决小牛浴火待重生新浪体育讯　2007年的暑假，德克-诺维茨基从法兰克福出发，经由迪拜，去往澳洲，62岁的导师霍尔格-格施温德尔是他唯一的旅伴。大堡礁、墨尔本、阿德莱德，他们租了辆车，五周的时间几乎跑遍整个澳洲。等到再度回到德国的时候，德克已经是满脸大胡子的野人了。这是一次心灵之旅，用德克的话，是去寻找“生命的真谛”。他需要忘记MVP的个人荣耀与小牛遭遇黑八耻辱之间的必然关联。“对我来说最艰难的是，这个MVP永远都将和小牛首轮被淘汰联系在一起，人们会说诺维茨基获奖名不符实……当我回想上赛季的时候，我想的不是MVP，而是季后赛失利，输球永远是我无法释怀的事情。”永远无法释怀的又何止是他一个人，可也正是这一次的旅行，教会了他如何去释怀。因为，放下，才能到达更远的前方。从2007年往前，他在这个联盟征战9年，他是公认的全联盟最好的五名球员之一，是新科MVP，带领小牛打出了67胜15负的绝佳战绩。可这一切又有什么用呢？这一切的荣耀在黑八面前轰然坍塌，一地的荒凉。或者，其实，命运的轮盘早就开启，在06年总决赛的一败涂地，在罚丢那该死的罚球的时候，就开启了。在南半球的丛林中，诺维茨基想过：“我在哪里？要去向何方？一个人的努力是否注定无法抗衡强大的命运？”此去经年，四年以后的今天，他重新站上总决赛的舞台，终于可以不再那么急促的呼吸，仔细的回想达拉斯这12年的前世今生。98年，老尼尔森将他从密尔沃基带到了达拉斯。熟悉他的人都会记得那张照片，干瘦干瘦的他，与同样干瘦干瘦的史蒂夫-纳什，梳着同样搞笑的发型，举起了达拉斯白色的球衣。刚满二十岁，稚嫩的不仅仅是球技，他无助彷徨却又警惕谨慎的面对这个陌生的世界。1999到2000赛季，打满82场，81场首发，老尼尔森给了他足够的信任，他用场均翻番的得分来回报。从2000到01赛季开始，小牛开始连续的杀入季后赛，而德克和纳什入选全明星，也昭示着达拉斯的崛起指日可待。梦在2004年第一次出现裂痕，止步季后赛首轮之后，纳什离开了球馆，却再也没有回来。宿命，当德克在2005年的5月，在西部半决赛中遭遇纳什所在的太阳的时候，他第一次开始相信这个词的存在。姚明第一次在球场上遭遇变成对手的弗朗西斯的时候主动请战，他说，只有打败他我才能真正的放下。德克也一样，宿命将他逼到绝境，他需要做的就是打破它！只可惜，这一年，他目送纳什和他的菲尼克斯太阳昂首迈进西部决赛，小牛再一次的打道回府。时光就这样来到了2006年的初夏，纳什和芬利的离开逐渐不再是心里的伤，愈合的伤疤成为坚守的理由，相望天涯也要为彼此赢下些什么。4比0横扫灰熊，7场大战击败马刺，西部决赛，他与纳什再相逢。前四场打成2比2，各丢一个主场。重回达拉斯，德克交出了50分，53.8%的命中率，94.4%的罚球命中率，83.3%的三分球命中率的成绩单，小牛末节打出35比20的攻击潮，一举拿下赛点。4比2，德克与纳什挥别，也与桎梏了他一整年的宿命挥别，踏上全新的舞台。那一年他28岁，最最黄金的年纪。那一年，他的身边有杰森-特里。连下两城，无限风光就在眼前，该死的宿命却在第三场再度搅局。前三节，一切都按照小牛设想的那样发展着，77-68，小牛领先9分，然而最后一节，韦德带领热火上演大翻盘。全场比赛还有9.3秒，佩顿远投中的为热火反超比分。德克进攻造犯规，可是，他最引以自豪的罚球害了他。两罚一中，韦德抢下篮板，小牛只能犯规，将胜利拱手相让。就像2005年输给太阳一样，德克低估了心理崩塌的破坏力，连输4场，让对手在自己的主场捧杯。2007年，67胜15负，联盟最佳战绩，常规赛MVP，诺维茨基却未曾想见站在自己对面的仍旧是打不破的宿命——曾经的恩师老尼尔森。金州人在老尼尔森的调教下成为真正的勇士，4比2将领头羊小牛在首轮就送回了家。如果说，总决赛的失败多少带着些安慰的话，黑八将诺维茨基彻底的打进了深渊，万劫不复。他想不明白，更弄不懂，是什么让自己走到今天的境地。明明尽了力，明明是至高无上的荣耀，却为何都变成了耻辱？软弱、伪领袖、永远悲情的配角，这一个个标签无情的贴上，就再难撕下。那时候，就连特里，也都不理解他，哪怕他们身边的人已经一个个走散在天涯。送走德文-哈里斯，迎来基德，到底是对是错？历史从来不是一天写成，一笔交易的成败也需要时间来验证。至少在2007-2008赛季，小牛被证明是失败的，面对新生代明星克里斯-保罗，基德没能给小牛带来奇迹，还是首轮游。08-09赛季，卡莱尔接过教鞭，这个被球迷亲昵的称为“金-凯瑞”的教练与小将军约翰逊是完全两个风格的。他更加的儒雅，更加的不动声色。可他沉静如水的底下是对诺维茨基坚定不移的信任。4比1击败马刺，半决赛输给掘金，这时候的西部已经不再是当年的西部了。无论是湖人、掘金还是新贵黄蜂，哪一个与小牛相比都要豪华的多，都要强悍的多。又是55胜27负，09-10赛季常规赛让小牛有足够的资本，西南赛区的头名，可还是败在了马刺的脚下。又是一笔血债，只是这一次，不知道什么时候开始的，诺维茨基的身上，整个小牛的身上，多了一份淡然。这是潜移默化的形成，这是气质的蜕变。从穿上小牛的球衣到今天，整整13年，从离开纳什开始一个人走自己的路，也已经7年。这些年是被泪水浸湿的，是被一次次从云端推落的，也是德克一口口咽下宿命苦涩的过程。我曾怀疑我走在沙漠中从不结果无论种什么梦才张开翅膀风却便沉默习惯伤痛能不能算收获可是，你要相信，只有阳光没有阴影，只有欢乐没有痛苦，这绝不是人生的常态。风平浪静造就不出坚韧不拔的水手。梦做过可能就会被忘记，可诺维茨基这个梦，是铭刻在心里的，又怎么能忘。首轮淘汰开拓者还有些步履蹒跚，西部半决赛横扫湖人更多的是让人们见识了小牛整个纵队的深度。雷霆，给小牛制造了最多麻烦的球队，也给了德克最多的机会来证明自己。24罚全中的神迹，连续两场的关键球，晋级的关键三分……他开始承担起一个真正领袖该有的担当，不是场场50+，不是一己之力拖着球队前行。他学会更多的传球，他坚持克制自己，谨慎的出手，他成全队友，换来队友对自己的成全。最重要的，在生死的那一刻，在队友信任的将球交到他手上的时候，他的眼底，没有彷徨，没有犹豫，那是一片澄澈的天空，可以任由梦想翱翔。所以，命运将热火再一次的，适时的送到他的面前。为自己正名，他有真正的宿命要打破。五年前，溺毙在漫天的热火中，五年后，他要浴火重生！庆幸的是我一直没回头终于发现真的是有绿洲每把汗流了生命变的厚重走出沮丧才看见新宇宙海阔天空在勇敢以后要拿执着将命运的锁打破冷漠的人谢谢你们曾经看轻我让我不低头更精彩的活你从来不是在跟什么人争，不是在跟一支球队争，你真正的敌人一直是你自己。2011年的6月，这个来自德国的司机，驾驶着达拉斯的梦，终究迎来了与命运再搏一把的机会。热火不再是曾经的热火，小牛也不再是曾经的小牛，诺维茨基更不再是曾经的那个德克，他始终心存愧疚，他要用铮铮铁骨，置身热火熔炉，百炼成钢！(暖暖)	德克-诺维茨基,特里,佩顿,小将军约翰逊,姚明,纳什,韦德,老尼尔森,杰森-特里,弗朗西斯,卡莱尔,德克,诺维茨基,史蒂文森,阿尔德里奇,霍尔格-格施温德尔,基德,克里斯-保罗,德文-哈里斯,金-凯瑞,芬利	正向	"The German driver drove the dream of Dallas to a fateful duel with the Mavericks. Sina Sports News In the summer of 2007, Dirk Nowitzki set out from Frankfurt via Dubai to Australia. Holger Geswein德尔, his 62 year old tutor, was his only companion. Great Barrier Reef, Melbourne, Adelaide, they rented a car and almost ran through Australia in five weeks. When he returned to Germany again, Dirk was a bearded wild man. This is a journey of the soul. In Dirk's words, it is to ""look for the truth of life"". He needs to forget the inevitable connection between the personal glory of MVP and the humiliation of the Mavericks. ""The hardest thing for me is that this MVP will always be linked with the Mavericks' elimination in the first round, and people will say Nowitzki doesn't deserve the prize... When I think back to last season, I don't think of the MVP, but the playoff defeat, and losing is always something I can't let go of."" He is not the only one who can never let go, but it is this journey that teaches him how to let go. Because, only by letting go can we reach a farther place. From 2007 onwards, he fought in this league for 9 years. He was one of the five best players in the league, the new MVP, and led the Mavericks to an excellent record of 67-15. But what's the use of all this? All the glory collapsed in the face of Black Eight, a wasteland. Or, in fact, the wheel of fate has opened long ago. When he lost completely in the 2006 finals and missed the damn free throw, it opened. In the jungle of the southern hemisphere, Nowitzki thought: ""Where am I? Where are you going? Is a person's efforts destined to be unable to compete with the powerful destiny?"" For four years, he has stood on the stage of the finals again today, and he can finally breathe less hurriedly and carefully recall the past and present life of Dallas in 12 years. In 1998, Nelson brought him from Milwaukee to Dallas. Those who know him will remember the picture. He was thin and thin, with the same funny hairstyle as Steve Nash, and he held up the white jersey of Dallas. Just twenty years old, naivety is not just ball skills. He helplessly faces this strange world with caution. In the 1999-2000 season, he played 82 games and 81 started. Nelson gave him enough trust, and he gave a return with a score that doubled. Since the 2000-01 season, the Mavericks began to continue to make the playoffs, and Dirk and Nash were selected as All Stars, which also shows that the rise of Dallas is at hand. The dream first cracked in 2004. After the first round of the playoffs, Nash left the gym and never returned. Fate, when Dirk met Nash of the Suns in the Western Conference semi-finals in May 2005, he began to believe in the existence of this word for the first time. Yao Ming volunteered to fight for the first time when he met Francis, who had become an opponent on the court. He said that only by defeating him could I really let go. Dirk is the same. Fate forces him to a dead end, and what he needs to do is to break it! Unfortunately, this year, he saw Nash and his Phoenix Suns stride forward to the Western Conference Finals, and the Mavericks once again returned home. Time came to the early summer of 2006. Nash and Finley's leaving gradually ceased to be the injury in their hearts. The healing scar became the reason to stick to. They also won something for each other in the distance. The Grizzlies were swept 4-0 and the Spurs were defeated 7-0 in the Western Conference Finals, and he met Nash again. In the first four games, they lost one home game each. Back in Dallas, Dirk handed out a score of 50 points, 53.8% shooting, 94.4% free throw, and 83.3% three-point shot, and the Mavericks scored a wave of 35-20 in the last quarter, winning the game point. 4 to 2, Dirk waved goodbye to Nash and the destiny that had shackled him for a whole year, and embarked on a new stage. He was 28 years old, the most golden age. That year, he had Jason Terry around him. Two cities in a row, unlimited scenery is at hand, but the damn destiny once again messes up in the third game. In the first three quarters, everything developed as the Mavericks had imagined. 77-68, the Mavericks were 9 points ahead. However, in the last quarter, Wade led the Heat to make a big comeback. There were 9.3 seconds left in the whole game, and Payton scored a long shot for the Heat to over score. Dirk fouled offensively, but his free throw, which he was most proud of, hurt him. One in two free throws, Wade grabbed the rebound, and the Mavericks had to commit a foul and give up the victory. Just like losing to the Suns in 2005, Dirk underestimated the destructive power of psychological collapse, and lost four games in a row, allowing his opponent to win the championship at his own home. In 2007, 67-15, the best record in the league, the regular season MVP, Nowitzki never thought that he was still standing in front of the unbreakable fate - the former teacher Nelson. The people of Jinzhou became real warriors under the tutelage of Old Nelson, and the leading Mavericks were sent back home in the first round. If the failure of the finals was somewhat comforting, the Black Eight would completely beat Nowitzki into the abyss, never to recover. He couldn't understand, let alone, what made him come to today's situation. Obviously, I have tried my best. I am the most supreme honor, but why did it all turn into shame? Weak, fake leader, eternal tragic supporting role, these labels are无情pasted up, and it is hard to tear them down. At that time, even Terry did not understand him, even if the people around him had drifted away from the ends of the earth one by one. Sending away Devin Harris and welcoming Kidd, is it right or wrong? History has never been written in a day, and it also takes time to verify the success or failure of a transaction. At least in the 2007-2008 season, the Mavericks were proved to be a failure. Facing the new generation of star Chris Paul, Kidd didn't bring miracles to the Mavericks, but it was still the first round of travel. In the 2008-09 season, Carlisle took over the coaching job. The coach who was affectionately called ""Jim Carey"" by fans was completely different from General Johnson. He is more elegant and less silent. But under the calm water, he has an unwavering trust in Nowitzki. 4-1 defeat Spurs, lost to Nuggets in the semi-finals. At this time, the West has changed from the past. Whether it is Lakers, Nuggets or the new noble Hornets, they are much more luxurious and stronger than the Mavericks. It was another 55-27 victory. The 2009-10 season regular season gave the Mavericks enough capital, the top of the Southwest District, but they still lost under the Spurs' feet. Another blood debt, but this time, I don't know when it started, Nowitzki and the whole Mavericks had more composure. This is an imperceptible formation, which is the transformation of气质. From wearing the Mavericks' jersey to today, it has been a whole 13 years, and it has been 7 years since Nash left and started to walk his own way. These years have been wet with tears, pushed down from the clouds again and again, and Dirk swallowed the bitterness of fate bit by bit. I once doubted that I walked in the desert without results. Whatever dream opened its wings, the wind was silent. I was used to pain. Can it be considered as harvest? But, you must believe that there is no shadow without sunshine, no pain without joy, and it is not the norm of life. Calm seas can not create tough sailors. Dreams may be forgotten after being dreamed, but Nowitzki's dream is engraved in his heart, how can he forget it. The first round of eliminating the Trailblazers was still staggering, and the Western Conference semifinals swept the Lakers more to show the depth of the entire纵队of the Mavericks. Thunder, the team that caused the most trouble to the Mavericks, also gave Dirk the most opportunities to prove himself. The miracle of 24 free throws, the key shots in two consecutive games, the key three points to promote... He began to shoulder the responsibility that a true leader should have. It is not a game of 50+, but the power of his own to drag"

巴萨主力后卫伤3周错过国家德比与曼联争夺拜仁边翼新浪体育讯　当地时间昨日，巴塞罗那队医对队内的法国左后卫阿比达尔进行了伤势检测，结果显示阿比达尔将因伤缺阵3个星期。在几天之前，阿比达尔应法国国家队的征召参加世预赛附加赛的比赛，在客场1-0战胜爱尔兰的比赛中，阿比达尔改打中后卫，表现中规中矩。但不幸的是，阿比达尔在比赛中受伤，赛后检测结果显示他的左脚肌肉腱膜拉伤，需要休养三周的时间。因为此次伤势，阿比达尔将错过接下来法国队与爱尔兰的第二回合附加赛比赛。按照3周的休战时间估算，阿比达尔还将错过本月底在诺坎普球场与皇家马德里队进行的国家德比。随着年龄的增大，阿比达尔的伤势逐渐增多，这已经是阿比达尔本赛季第二次因伤长时间缺阵，上赛季他的伤病次数就已经很多。在阿比达尔受伤期间，巴西后卫马克斯维尔将出任球队主力左后卫。而阿比达尔的频繁受伤，也让巴萨边后卫引援的传言再次响起。据法国一家媒体披露，拜仁后卫拉姆有意离开拜仁，巴萨、曼联、尤文图斯等豪门球队都将加入争夺当中；如果拉姆加盟巴萨，将与阿尔维斯形成左右齐飞的边后卫助攻形式。(伊雷克森)	伊雷克森,阿尔维斯,拉姆,马克斯维尔,阿比达尔	负向	The main guard of Barcelona was injured for 3 weeks to miss the national derby and Manchester United competed with Bayern for Sina Sports News, the local time yesterday.

温泉狂人肖睿哲从26岁的肖睿哲身上，你可以看到幼小的梦也能发芽、茁壮成长。这个生于80后的男孩，是近日热议的“阿里云”的一员，也是phpwind(杭州德天信息技术有限公司)的副总。工作时，他表现出超越年龄的成熟；生活里却依然顽皮如少年，依赖妈妈。他的目标是成为能力挽狂澜的“英雄式企业家”，一个企业的灵魂人物。肖睿哲每天的日程安排都很满，比如今天：上午先在酒店处理琐碎的事务性问题，中午接受采访，下午跟全体北京同事开大会，晚上继续进行产品研发，全天没一刻休息。接受采访前，肖睿哲利用短暂的半小时在健身房里跑步，他说出出汗能让他精力充沛。毕竟，这个26岁的大男孩，体内充满了能量。肖睿哲出生在武汉一个商人家庭，爸爸早期经商，所以家境殷实。但是因为一次失败的地产投资，爸爸的事业境况跌入谷底。肖睿哲从他身上看到命运无常，也埋下从逆境中扭转命运的决心。从phpwind到云计算或许来自爸爸的商人基因，肖睿哲一直有创业梦想。在高中时期他已经和同学创建过自己的游戏网站，甚至有过一些收入。但高中时期创业单凭着一种冲动，一心想吧网站做大，却不知道通过什么途径才能让网站稳步发展起来。不过那一次体验和经历，为肖睿哲后来的事业埋下伏笔。以不错的成绩考上北京交通大学后，肖睿哲却因为再次创业耽误了学业，导致没有顺利毕业。这次创业过程里，肖睿哲学到了现实操作经验。毕业前，为了证明自己的能力，他参加了毕业论文的选拔，并在评选中获得了第一名的成绩。毕业后，肖睿哲曾经在广告公司和网游公司打过工，当时他的同学王学集、林耀纳已经开始筹备创建phpwind了。2006年，应王学集之邀，肖睿哲终于找到“属于自己的归宿”，和同学一起重新打拼。刚进phpwind时，这里是只有20人的小公司，员工里一半是同学，一半是网友，公司开在大学园区里，租着3000元一个月的房子办公，办公家具和电脑都选性价比最高的。这个时期，肖睿哲已经感受到自己必须承担的责任，再不能只为个人梦想而忽视团队的存在，管理者是要对所有员工前途负责的。他开始学习江浙人的经商模式，“江浙人对成本管理得很严谨，今天花的钱一定会成为明天的产出。”正因为尽量压低成本，才使phpwind没有早早夭折。第一笔风险投资是来自王定标的300万元，这让创业中的几个年轻人信心倍增。有钱了，但几个人还是尽量压缩成本，公司搬到便宜的创业园区；每年两次到北京都事先攒好一堆出差要做的工作，借快捷酒店的折扣卡，让差旅费的价值最大化。还有一件事，让肖睿哲至今都津津乐道。那是创业期的春节，他们手里只有2万元现金给员工发奖金。拿着薄薄一沓子钱，面对30个员工，如何分配？肖睿哲恨不得写个程序出来。令他欣慰的是，同事们在春节聚会上并没有计较奖金多少，而是因为公司的发展喝了个痛快淋漓，这个春节让他记忆犹新。在phpwind的成长中，肖睿哲学会了如何管理团队，如何应对竞争。虽然公司已经发展到200人，除了杭州总部，今年又开设了北京分公司，但创业时期的同事基本没有流失。肖睿哲说：“当时管理团队都是讲感情，现在要靠激励制度和规范的管理模式，不能像以前那样感性管理了。”而产品在大规模使用后，也带来了研发上的压力。为了对产品进行升级，肖睿哲和同事3天3夜住在公司，因为没脱过鞋最终导致细菌感染。好在这些付出终于看到了回报。阿里巴巴经过半年时间考察phpwind，从他们的研发技术到人员心态，经过几轮谈判最终将phpwind收编旗下，成为阿里云计算中心的一部分。虽进入阿里云的团队，但phpwind还独立运营自己的业务，这种两条腿走路的模式使他们机会更多，也搭上IT“大佬”的顺风车。在阿里云，肖睿哲遇到了自己的偶像王坚，这个有3个博士学位的前浙大院长，40岁出头已经是技术派里的顶尖级人物，同时又有感性的一面，是那种在企业里闪闪发光的灵魂人物。成为企业里的灵魂人物，在逆境中成为力挽狂澜的英雄是肖睿哲一直以来的梦想，为此，他在20多岁时让自己尽情磨砺，或许30岁的肖睿哲，就会成为下一个马云。从创业型企业到中型企业，时间对肖睿哲来说总是不够用。但是与前辈们不同，这个80后的IT管理者更关注“人”的感受。Phpwind团队建设中很重要的是“OUTTING”，就是公司选个山清水秀的地方或者开会、或者进行培训。肖睿哲相信，玩乐和工作是可以统一结合的，虽然每次他并没有太多精力去享受山水，看着同事们能在头脑风暴后彻底放松，自己也会笑得痛快。温泉收集狂以前，肖睿哲是个电子产品的收集狂人，这与他是IT从业者有关，只要有新的电子产品发布，他第一时间买回来，还经常自己拆机改装。大到电脑主机、小到手机、数码相机，在杭州的家里已经堆了一座小山似的电子藏品。近年来，随着事业发展和个性成熟，肖睿哲对电子产品已经没那么发烧了，现在的他，算是一个温泉收集狂人，并且在心目中有属于自己的温泉排行榜。第一次泡温泉，还是在北京读书时去的小汤山九华山庄，那次经历让他失望透了。“温泉池的水很可疑，而且人又多，风景也不美。”再次泡温泉，已经是几年后在杭州做phpwind了，肖睿哲去了杭州附近的金华武义温泉，那里有个清水湾温泉度假村，里面有各种风格的温泉池，还有可爱的鱼疗设施。武义一行，让肖睿智开始迷恋上温泉。“可能因为裸体状态和在水里的时候人最放松，所以洗澡、泡温泉会让我思路更清晰，压力很快消失了。”肖睿哲很推崇黄山的醉温泉，在山里泡汤的时候，身边是郁郁葱葱的山林，晚上边喝酒边泡汤，和朋友聊天，更是惬意。北海是肖睿哲经常去的地方，他喜欢涠洲岛未开发的静僻，更喜欢那里接近大自然朴实风格的温泉。为了泡温泉，肖睿哲还去过日本北海道，“是全裸温泉，风景非常震撼，外边下着雪，我们在热乎乎的温泉里喝酒，太享受了。”只不过因为身在异地，肖睿哲觉得日本温泉虽然好，却少一分自在怡然的心情。肖睿哲心目中的第一位，是厦门的日月谷温泉，那里不仅风景美，食物好吃，温泉水更是地道的矿物质水。目前为止，肖睿哲已经去过快10处温泉了，未来还打算到欧洲的温泉感受一下，“听说古代欧洲人都是用温泉治病养生的。”和很多“啃老”的80后比，当了副总的肖睿哲是个难得的孝顺孩子，为了让商场失意的爸爸振作起来，肖睿哲把父母接到杭州自己身边，“不是怕他们不放心我，而是我不放心他们。”每天早上，肖睿哲吃完妈妈做的早饭上班，中午吃妈妈亲手做的爱心便当，晚上11点下班后，妈妈已经煮好甜汤等他，一家人聚在一起边喝汤边聊天。肖睿哲还为妈妈办了信用卡的副卡，让她随便买自己喜欢的东西，让爸爸做自己喜欢的事，这就是他表达爱的方式。“我已经有能力承担照顾这个家的责任，现在的心愿就是看着爸爸妈妈快乐，不要再操心。”其实付出爱的同时，他也感受到爱的力量。“每次出差住酒店都要自己洗衣服烫衣服，这时候就发现妈妈在身边的好。”工作上遇到困境难题，想到妈妈爸爸在家期待自己的样子，就会充满努力的勇气。这个26岁的大男孩，学会了照顾一家公司，照顾自己的家人、同事，看着自己幼小的梦想慢慢发芽、茁壮成长，庆幸着自己的青春没有被辜负。肖睿哲的温泉指南武义温泉位于浙江金华，除了传统的温泉，还设有酸奶池、咖啡池、灵芝池、丹桂池、名木池、名花池、芦荟池、酒池、武阳春雨池(茶叶温泉)、西湖池(造型像西湖，里面也同样衬有三潭印月)、鱼疗池等。黄山醉温泉位于安徽黄山景区内，共分7大主题，分别为水疗区、动感区、养颜区、美食区、温泉广场区、微粹区与木屋区，共有50多种系列60多个温泉池。醉温泉属于偏硅酸多元复合型温泉，富含偏硅酸、钾、钠、镁、溴、铁等微量元素，水质中性温和，PH值为6.6。涠洲温泉涠洲岛是我国最大最年轻的死火山岛，位于广西北海市东南面36海里处，与银滩隔海相望。它附近有一个斜阳岛，站在涠洲岛上可以观看到太阳斜照该岛的情景，这就是著名的“涠州斜阳”。岛上温泉天然纯朴，游客边品尝海鲜边泡汤，是难得的美食与温泉完美结合的地方。北海温泉位于云南腾冲，最初是简陋的露天洗浴澡塘，热水统一由一眼机井供应，水温55℃，每昼夜涌水1100立方米。经多家地质部门勘查检验，其水质是低矿化度的碳酸温泉，并含有少量对人体有益的微量元素和放射性元素，除可用作洗浴疗疾外，还可供制成非常好的饮用矿泉水，是腾冲为数不多的既可浴又可饮用的温泉之一。厦门日月谷温泉总体规划26万平方米，气势磅礴，富有浓郁东南亚异国风情，设有近百个露天温泉泡池，几十种特色温泉。日月谷温泉水源自地下200米深处，出口水温82℃，用纯正的温泉水煮出的蛋，充分吸收了泉水中的矿物质，补充人体每日所需多种营养素，有良好的保健养生功效。怒江边的温泉云南怒江傈傈族自治州泸水县，最出名的民俗是春节期间举行的“澡塘会”了。人们下到烫人的简易石砌温泉澡池中，洗去污垢，舒展筋骨，然后聚在一起谈天说地，对歌跳舞，其实也就是傈僳族的狂欢节。德宗温泉距离拉萨140公里，位于山谷之中，两旁山坡是高山牧场，绿草如茵。温泉是气泡浴，可以治很多皮肤病。池子分为男池和女池，中间隔着一堵石墙。有趣的是德宗温泉的狗，天天在那儿懒洋洋地晒太阳，看着那些赤身裸体的人。美圻/文范永恒/摄影	王学集,范永恒,王定标,林耀纳,美圻,肖睿哲,王坚	正向	"Xiao Ruijie, a hot spring maniac, can see that a young dream can also sprout and grow from Xiao Ruijie at the age of 26. The boy who was born in the 80s is a member of the recently popular ""Alibaba Cloud"", and the vice president of phpwind (Hangzhou Detian Information Technology Co., Ltd.). When working, he shows maturity beyond his age; However, he is still as naughty as a teenager in his life, relying on his mother. His goal is to become a ""heroic entrepreneur"" with the ability to save the day, a soul figure of an enterprise. Xiao Ruijie's schedule is very full every day, such as today: first, deal with trivial administrative problems at the hotel in the morning, give an interview at noon, have a meeting with all Beijing colleagues in the afternoon, and continue product development in the evening. There is no rest for a moment all day. Before the interview, Xiao Ruijie took a short half hour to run in the gym. He said that sweating could make him energetic. After all, this 26 year old boy is full of energy. Xiao Ruijie was born in a businessman's family in Wuhan. His father was an early businessman, so his family was very rich. But because of a failed real estate investment, his father's career fell to the bottom. Xiao Ruijie saw the impermanence of fate from him, and also buried the determination to reverse his fate in adversity. Maybe Xiao Ruijie has always had the dream of starting a business from phpwind to cloud computing because of his father's business genes. He has already created his own game website with his classmates when he was in high school, and even made some money. But when I started a business in high school, I just had an impulse to make the website bigger, but I didn't know how to make the website develop steadily. However, that experience laid the groundwork for Xiao Ruijie's later career. After being admitted to Beijing Jiaotong University with good grades, Xiao Ruijie delayed his studies because of starting a business again, which led to his unsuccessful graduation. In the process of this entrepreneurship, Xiao Ruijie learned practical experience. Before graduation, in order to prove his ability, he participated in the selection of graduation thesis and won the first place in the selection. After graduation, Xiao Ruijie once worked in advertising companies and online game companies. At that time, his classmates, Wang Xueji and Lin Yaona, had begun to prepare for the creation of phpwind. In 2006, at the invitation of Wang Xueji, Xiao Ruijie finally found ""his own destination"" and fought again with his classmates. When I first entered phpwind, there were only 20 people here, half of the employees were classmates and half were netizens. The company opened in the university park, rented a house for 3000 yuan a month, and chose the highest cost performance for office furniture and computers. At this stage, Xiao Ruijie has felt the responsibility he must bear. He can no longer ignore the existence of the team for his personal dream. The manager is responsible for the future of all employees. He began to learn the business model of Jiang Zhe people. ""People in Jiang Zhe are very strict in cost management. The money spent today will certainly become tomorrow's output."" It is precisely because of the efforts to reduce costs that phpwind has not died early. The first risk investment was 3 million yuan from Wang Dingbiao, which greatly increased the confidence of several young people in their careers. With money, but several people still try to reduce costs. The company moved to the cheap industrial park; Save a pile of work to be done on a business trip in Beijing twice a year in advance, and borrow the discount card of the hotel to maximize the value of the travel expenses. There is one thing that Xiao Ruijie still likes to talk about. It was the Spring Festival during the start-up period, and they had only 20000 yuan in cash to give employees bonuses. With a thin pile of money in hand, how to allocate it to 30 employees? Xiao Ruijie can't wait to write a program. To his relief, the colleagues did not care about the amount of bonus at the Spring Festival party, but drank a lot because of the development of the company, which made this Spring Festival unforgettable to him. In the growth of phpwind, Xiao Ruijie learned how to manage a team and how to deal with competition. Although the company has developed to 200 people, in addition to the headquarters in Hangzhou, this year has opened a branch in Beijing, but the colleagues in the start-up period have basically not lost. Xiao Ruijie said: ""At that time, the management team was all about feelings. Now we have to rely on the incentive system and standardized management model. We can't manage emotionally like before."" After the product was used on a large scale, it also brought pressure on research and development. In order to upgrade the product, Xiao Ruijie and his colleagues lived in the company for three days and three nights because they never took off their shoes, which eventually led to bacterial infection. Fortunately, these efforts have finally paid off. Alibaba spent half a year examining phpwind, from their research and development technology to people's mentality. After several rounds of negotiations, phpwind was finally incorporated under its jurisdiction and became part of Alibaba Cloud Computing Center. Although we have entered the Ali Cloud team, phpwind still operates its own business independently. This model of walking with two legs makes them have more opportunities and ride on the顺windof IT ""bigwigs"". At Aliyun, Xiao Ruijie met his idol Wang Jian, the former president of Zhejiang University with three doctorates. He was a top figure in technology at the age of 40. He was also a sensitive person, a shining soul figure in the enterprise. To become a soul figure in an enterprise, and to become a hero who can save the day in adversity is Xiao Ruijie's dream all along. For this reason, he let himself sharpen at his will in his twenties. Perhaps Xiao Ruijie, at the age of 30, will become the next Jack Ma. Time is always not enough for Xiao Ruijie from a start-up enterprise to a medium-sized enterprise. However, unlike his predecessors, the 80's IT manager pays more attention to the feelings of ""people"". An important part of the phpwind team building is ""OUTTING"", that is, the company selects a beautiful mountain and water place for a conference or training. Xiao Ruijie believes that play and work can be unified. Although he does not have much energy to enjoy the scenery every time, he will smile happily when he sees his colleagues completely relax after brainstorming. Xiao Ruijie used to be an electronic product collector. This is related to his being an IT worker. Whenever a new electronic product is launched, he will buy it back for the first time and often disassemble and modify it by himself. From computers to mobile phones and digital cameras, a small hill of electronic collections has been piled up in his home in Hangzhou. In recent years, with the development of his career and the maturity of his personality, Xiao Ruijie has not been so enthusiastic about electronic products. Now, he is a hot spring collector, and he has his own hot spring ranking in his mind. The first hot spring bath was at Xiaotangshan Jiu Hua Villa in Beijing, and that experience made him very disappointed. ""The water"
诺伦领先威尔士赛次轮麦克道尔居次席达利出局新浪体育讯　北京时间6月4日，在拿到个人首次角逐美国公开赛资格的四天之后，瑞典人亚历山大-诺伦(AlexanderNoren)周五在凯尔特庄园以一杆优势获得欧巡赛-威尔士公开赛次轮的领先，世界排名第五的卫冕冠军格莱姆-麦克道尔位居次席，而首次参赛的美国名将约翰-达利、莱德杯明星西蒙尼斯、罗斯-菲舍尔都被淘汰。在威尔士公开赛第二轮的比赛中，世界排名第127位的诺伦连续第二天打出67杆(-4)，以134杆(-8)的总成绩排在第1位。北爱尔兰名将麦克道尔交出68杆(-3)，以135杆(-7)的总成绩位居第2位。威尔士本土球手杰米-唐纳森(JamieDonaldson，68杆)与法国球手维克多-杜比森(VictorDubuisson，69杆)都以136杆(-6)的总成绩排在并列第3位。首轮领先者基斯-霍恩(KeithHorne，73杆)、去年莱德杯欧洲队队员彼得-汉森(72杆)、英格兰老将巴里-莱恩(BarryLane，69杆)都一道以137杆(-5)的总成绩位居并列第5位，其中，将在本月底年满51岁的莱恩有望在这里成为欧巡赛夺冠年龄最大的球手。本周一，诺伦在英格兰沃尔登-希思高尔夫俱乐部(WaltonHeathGolfClub)举行的美国公开赛欧洲区选拔赛上成功闯关，首次获得了在美国进行的大满贯赛的参赛资格。这无疑令他胸有成竹地来到凯尔特庄园。“我一直以来都梦想着参加一场美国公开赛，我非常高兴，非常高兴，这极大地增强了活力。”这位28岁的瑞典人此前只参加过两场英国公开赛，其中在2008年的英国公开赛上获得了并列第19名的佳绩。在威尔士公开赛的第二轮里，诺伦最后阶段的表现非常突出，在最后5个洞抓下4只小鸟，从而以一杆优势上升至榜首位置。由于他早上出发比赛，很早便完成了比赛，当时他还错误地预估次轮领先者的总杆数为-9或者-10。毕竟，最终夺得36洞领先的便是打出-8的诺伦本人。“球场打起来感觉很长，就像你平常要用很多挖起杆来击球，到了今天，却要换上7号铁、6号铁、5号铁来击球。你能够打得相当安全，不过你将面临着较长的推杆距离，难推的推杆，如果你想要抓下小鸟，这会非常困难。”诺伦在欧巡赛只获得了一个冠军，那就是2009年的欧米茄欧洲大师赛。麦克道尔同样在5个洞里迎来了4只小鸟，那是从8号洞开始的。然而，他本轮的亮点还有在较短的10号洞里从沙坑的边缘下打出的精彩救球。“其中一个男孩说，塞弗(塞弗-巴耶斯德罗斯)将会为那一杆感到骄傲。”麦克道尔说，“我站在喜欢的一座球场上，处于我享受的位置上。这绝对是备战美国公开赛(他两周之后也要展开美国公开赛的卫冕战)的完美时刻。我说过我只是想要进入冠军争夺战，激发灵感，现在有几分完成任务的感觉。”麦克道尔将力争成为威尔士公开赛12年历史里第一位成功卫冕的冠军。唐纳森则成为目前排名最高的威尔士本土球手，他依旧在追寻个人职业生涯的首个欧巡赛桂冠。“我打得非常好，也许我今天打得比昨天更好，不过昨天我打得相当不错。今天的比赛很艰难，因为有风，因此保持你的杆数、保住多个洞的标准杆很重要。”继苏格兰球手艾略特-索特曼(ElliotSaltman)周四在211码的17号洞打出一杆进洞之后，周五又有另外一名苏格兰人乔治-默瑞(GeorgeMurray)在17号洞打出了一杆进洞。只可惜，只有在189码的13号洞打出一杆进洞才能获得赞助商提供的汽车大奖。威尔士公开赛两轮比赛过后，晋级决赛的资格线设为144杆(+2)的总成绩，总共有65名球手入围决赛。世界排名第26位的西班牙名将、去年莱德杯欧洲队队员西蒙尼斯(73-72)、去年莱德杯欧洲队副队长之一托马斯-比约恩(69-76)、印度名将米哈辛(68-79)、2008年莱德杯欧洲队队员奥利弗-威尔逊(73-77)、三届亚巡赛奖金王通差-贾第(76-75)、去年莱德杯欧洲队队员罗斯-菲舍尔(70-79)、首次角逐威尔士公开赛的两届大满贯冠军约翰-达利(77-75)、八届欧巡赛奖金王及2010年莱德杯欧洲队获胜队长蒙哥马利(78-79)等名将都被淘汰出局。其中，世界排名第52位的菲舍尔在被淘汰之后极有可能依旧处于世界排名前50名之外，这意味着他很可能与两周后举行的美国公开赛失之交臂。浏览成绩>>(罗毅)	莱德杯欧洲队队员,麦克道尔,基斯-霍恩,约翰-达利,唐纳森,比约恩,塞弗-巴耶斯德罗斯,杰米-唐纳森,通差-贾第,杜比森,西蒙尼斯,诺伦,乔治-默瑞,米哈辛,亚历山大-诺伦,托马斯-比约恩,维克多-杜比森,达利,莱德杯明星,奥利弗-威尔逊,莱恩,彼得-汉森,巴里-莱恩,艾略特-索特曼,罗斯-菲舍尔	正向	"Noren led the Welsh round by McDowell, Daly was eliminated Sina Sports News On June 4, Beijing time. Four days after winning the qualification for the first US Open Championship, the Swede Alexander Noren (AlexanderNoren) won the second round of the Welsh Open, the world's fifth defending champion Graeme McDowell, and the first American champion John Daly, Ryder Cup star Simonis and Ross Fisher were all eliminated. In the second round of the Wales Open, Noren, who ranked 127 in the world, played 67 (-4) for two consecutive days, ranking first with a total score of 134 (-8). The famous player from Northern Ireland, McDowell, handed over 68 (-3) and ranked second with a total score of 135 (-7). Jamie Donaldson (68), a Welsh local golfer, and Victor Dubuisson (69), a French golfer, were tied for third place with a total score of 136 (-6). The first round leader Keith Horne (73), Peter Hanson (72), a member of the European team of last year's Ryder Cup, and Barry Lane (69), an English veteran, were all tied for fifth place with a total score of 137 (-5). Among them, Lane, who will turn 51 at the end of this month, is expected to become the oldest player in the European Tour Championship here. On Monday, Noren successfully passed the European selection competition of the US Open held at Walton Heath Golf Club (Walton Heath Golf Club) in England, and won the qualification to participate in the major championship held in the United States for the first time. This undoubtedly made him come to Celtic Manor with confidence. ""I have always dreamed of participating in an open tournament in the United States. I am very happy, very happy, which greatly enhances vitality."" The 28 year old Swede has only participated in two British Open Championships, including the tied 19th place in the 2008 British Open Championship. In the second round of the Welsh Open, Noren's performance in the final stage was very outstanding. He caught four birds in the last five holes, thus rising to the top position with a one stroke advantage. Since he started the game in the morning, he finished the game very early, and at that time, he wrongly forecast that the total score of the second round leader would be -9 or -10. After all, the winner of 36 hole was Noren himself, who scored -8. ""The golf course feels very long to play, just like you usually use a lot of wedges to hit the ball. Today, you have to change to 7, 6, and 5 irons to hit the ball. You can play quite safely, but you will face long putting distance and difficult putting. If you want to catch a bird, it will be very difficult."" Noren only won one championship in the European Tour, which was the 2009 Omega European Masters. McDowell also welcomed four birds from the 8th hole in five holes. However, the highlight of his round was the wonderful save from the edge of the bunker in the short 10th hole. ""One of the boys said Seve (Seve Ballesteros) would be proud of that shot,"" McDowell said. ""I stand on a court I like, in a position I enjoy. This is definitely the perfect moment to prepare for the US Open (he will also defend the US Open in two weeks). I just want to get into the championship battle and inspire, and now I feel a bit of accomplishment."" McDowell will strive to become the first champion who has successfully defended the Welsh Open in 12 years. Donaldson became the highest ranking Welsh local golfer at present, and he is still pursuing his first European Tour championship in his career. ""I played very well. Maybe I played better today than yesterday, but yesterday was quite good. Today's game is very hard because of the wind, so it is important to keep your score and par of many holes."" After Scottish golfer Elliot Soltman (Elliot Saltman) hit a hole in one on the 17th hole of 211 yards on Thursday, another Scot, George Murray (George Murray), hit a hole in one on the 17th hole on Friday. Unfortunately, only a hole in one at the 13th hole of 189 yards can win the car prize offered by the sponsor. After two rounds of the Wales Open, the qualification line for the final was set at 144 (+2), and a total of 65 players qualified for the final. The Spanish star Simonis (73-72), who ranked 26th in the world and was a member of last year's European Ryder Cup team, Thomas Bjorn (69-76), one of the deputy leaders of the European Ryder Cup team last year, Indian star Jee Ha Xin (68-79), Oliver Wilson (73-77), a member of the 2008 European Ryder Cup team, Thongchai Jati (76-75), a three-time Asian Tour prize money king, Ross Fisher (70-79), a member of last year's European Ryder Cup team, John Daly (77-75), a two-time major champion who played in the Welsh Open for the first time, and Montgomerie (78-79), an eight time European Tour prize money king and the winning captain of the 2010 European Ryder Cup, and other famous players were all eliminated.

车主为防柴油被偷每日花1小时将油抽出拎回家前晚10点多，有市民报警称一对男女拿着自制的抽油泵，正在偷南京春江街路边工程车油箱内的柴油。警方迅速赶到现场，发现是场误会，该男女就是工程车车主，最近加柴油难，小偷又频繁光顾，偷他们车里的油。他们实在被偷怕了，无奈之下才想出防偷笨招，每天将油箱内柴油抽出，拎回家过夜，第二天早晨再将油倒进油箱。虽然很折腾，但是每天回家睡觉心里踏实了。虚惊一场有人晚上偷工程车柴油南京春江街道路宽敞，道路两边慢车道成了免费停车场，一到晚间就有大量货车、吊车、工程车停靠于此。前晚10点，张先生驾车至春江街寻找空地停车时，发现一个男子拿着自制的抽油泵，正在抽取一辆工程车油箱内的柴油，抽出来的柴油全部流进一只扁平的铁皮油桶中。男子身旁有个女子一直在左顾右盼，时不时还催促一下男子抓紧抽油。很快，工程车油箱内柴油被抽光，那对男女将抽出来的柴油封存，快速塞进一辆面包车中。“最近好多加油站没有柴油，就是有柴油的加油站，车辆也排成长龙，不等个个把小时加不到油。那对男女半夜出来抽柴油，举动古怪，一看就像偷柴油的。”张先生说，他也没多想，就拨打110报警。冤枉我们是在防油被偷很快，110民警赶到春江街巡查，那对男女远远见到警车，并无躲闪之意，而是继续抽着柴油，这“肆无忌惮”的一幕让民警也觉得诧异。民警核对了男女的身份信息和车辆信息，结果发现是一场误会，这对男女不是偷油贼，他们是一对夫妇，是这辆工程车车主，抽走油箱内的油只是防止小偷下贼手偷油。虚惊背后是无奈据男子王某介绍，他在南京一家工地做工程，除了拥有两辆工程车外，他还有一辆小型吊车。这段时间柴油紧张，想到自己的三台车每天都要开工，他每天下班前都会让工人将三台车加满油。这样，早上一起来就可以出车开工，不会耽误工期。可是五天前的一个早上，王师傅吃过早餐开车出发时，却发现吊车仪表盘上显示剩余柴油不多。前一晚上刚加的油怎么就没了呢？王师傅下车检查油箱，油箱一点破损没有，可油箱见底，这时他才明白遭贼了。王师傅懊恼不已，急忙查看另外两辆工程车油箱，结果发现工程车油箱也被偷空了。“损失两千多元油费不说，工地一天的活也算泡汤了。”王师傅当时就向警方报了警。警方到场做了备案登记，并展开调查。不想事隔一天，前面的偷油案还没查出个结果，自己的吊车油箱又被贼光顾了，又损失了一箱柴油，耽误了一天工期。实在是被贼偷怕了，王师傅夫妇才想出了苦招，每天将油箱内的柴油抽出，拎回家保管，第二天再倒进油箱，好让贼扑空。不想这次抽油被人撞个正着，本是防偷油，结果被人误会成偷油贼了。无奈之举有隐患三台车抽一次油要个把小时“要不是柴油看紧，我才不愿意这么辛苦天天抽油回家储存。”王师傅说，自己在工地上干活，每天一早就要到工地，晚上6点才能收工，一家收入就全靠这三辆车子，工程车、吊车要是没油那就等同一堆废铜烂铁，自己一家的收入也就黄了。上次三辆车柴油被偷，损失了2000多元加油费，三辆车还都抛锚在路边。之后，他求爷爷告奶奶的，花了两个小时才跟同行借到了点柴油，勉强将三辆车开到附近一处加油站，到晚上才加到油，工地上的活全被耽搁了。一天活没干成，钱也没挣到，还被工地老板臭骂了一顿，这让他气愤不已。为了确保工地正常开工，王师傅每天下工时，第一件事就是加油，每次加油排队，少则三个小时，多则五个小时，辛苦加回来的柴油，要是给小偷偷走就太痛心了，所以才下定决心，就是再苦也要将油箱内的柴油抽出，然后拖回家。“三辆车油箱能装三百升柴油，全部抽出来至少要花一个小时，得6个50升的油桶才能装得下。”王师傅说，抽油是一件费事的活，刚开始，自己用皮管抽油，但是得要嘴巴吸，保不住就会喝上一口柴油，让自己直犯恶心。后来抽油方法有所改良，用上了自制的一只简易抽油泵。简易抽油泵跟以前打酱油的工具差不多，靠人力操作，非常费力。“这点苦还不算，每天抽油装入6只油桶后，还得用面包车拉回家，第二天还得再拉回头灌进油箱。”王师傅夫妇希望柴油荒早点结束，自己好不再吃这种多余的苦。王师傅每天辛苦地将柴油抽出，然后拖回家中保存，那么柴油存放在民房内会不会有危险？记者就此采访了南京消防。消防人员告诉记者，柴油易燃不易爆，大部分柴油闪点高于60℃，而且它并不在《危险化学品名录》中，因此它不属于危险化学品，但大量囤积肯定是不允许的，而用铁质容器少量存放并不属于违法行为。但是柴油毕竟是易燃物，还是具有一定的危险性，万一起火，那后果就不堪设想。所以，王师傅最好不要将柴油搬回家储存。消防人员还告诉记者，柴油虽然属重油，但有时里面混有轻油成分，特别是有些小炼油厂或个体炼油点炼制的柴油，其成分不符合标准，往往混有轻质油的成分。这些物质易挥发成气体，一旦遇到明火就会燃烧，达到爆炸极限引发爆炸，万一家中储存这种柴油，无疑就是将“定时炸弹”搬回家。　曹卢杰文/摄	王师傅,张先生,曹卢杰	正向	"Car owners spend an hour each day to drain the diesel oil out of the car in case it was stolen. At more than 10:00 p.m. last night, a citizen called the police, saying that a man and a woman were holding a self-made oil pump to steal the diesel oil in the fuel tank of the engineering vehicle on Chunjiang Street in Nanjing. The police quickly arrived at the scene and found that it was a misunderstanding. The man and the woman were the owners of the truck. Recently, it was difficult to add diesel oil, and thieves frequently visited, and stole the oil in their car. They were really afraid of being stolen, so they had no choice but to think of a stupid way to prevent theft. They withdrew the diesel oil in the tank every day, took it home for the night, and then poured the oil back into the tank the next morning. Although it was very torturing, I felt at ease when I went home to sleep every day. Someone stole diesel oil from the engineering vehicle in Nanjing Chunjiang Street last night, where the road was wide and the slow lanes on both sides of the road became free parking lots. At 10 o'clock last night, when Mr. Zhang drove to Chunjiang Street to look for a parking space, he found that a man with a self made oil pump was pumping diesel oil from the fuel tank of an engineering vehicle, and the diesel oil drawn out all flowed into a flat iron barrel. The man had a woman beside him who kept looking around and urging the man to抓紧oil from time to time. Soon, the diesel oil in the fuel tank of the engineering vehicle was drained, and the men and women sealed up the diesel oil that had been drawn out and quickly stuffed it into a minivan. ""Recently, many gas stations have no diesel oil. The gas stations with diesel oil have a long line of vehicles. They can't wait for hours to add oil. The man and woman came out at midnight to draw diesel oil, and their behavior was strange. They looked like stealing diesel oil."" Mr. Zhang said, but he didn't think much about it, so he dialed 110 to report the police. It is a misunderstanding for us to prevent oil from being stolen. Soon, the 110 police arrived at Chunjiang Street for patrol. Seeing the police car far away, the man and woman did not avoid it but continued to draw diesel oil. This ""reckless"" scene also made the police feel surprised. The police checked the identity information and vehicle information of the man and woman, and found that it was a misunderstanding. The man and woman were not oil thieves. They were a couple and the owner of the truck. The oil in the fuel tank was just to prevent the thief from stealing oil. There is no choice behind the false alarm. According to Mr. Wang, a man who works on a construction site in Nanjing, in addition to two engineering vehicles, he also has a small crane. At this time, diesel oil is in short supply. Thinking that his three vehicles have to start working every day, he will let workers fill up the three vehicles with fuel before work every day. In this way, you can leave the car in the morning to start working, which will not delay the construction period. But five days ago, when Master Wang had breakfast and started his car, he found that there was little diesel left on the crane dashboard. How did the oil just added last night disappear? Master Wang got out of the car to check the fuel tank. The fuel tank was not damaged at all, but the fuel tank was empty. At this time, he realized that he had been stolen. Master Wang was so annoyed that he hurried to check the fuel tanks of the other two engineering vehicles, only to find that the fuel tanks of the engineering vehicles had also been stolen. ""I didn't say that the loss of more than 2000 yuan for oil, but the work on the construction site was also in vain."" At that time, Master Wang reported the police. The police arrived to file a record and launched an investigation. I didn't want the day before yesterday. The oil theft case in front of me had not yet been found out, and my crane tank was visited by thieves again, losing a box of diesel oil and delaying a day's construction. It was really stealing that made Mr. Wang and his wife think of a bitter move. They withdrew the diesel oil in the fuel tank every day, took it home to keep it safe, and then poured it back into the fuel tank the next day, so that the thief could fall empty. I didn't want this oil drawing to hit someone on the spot. It was originally intended to prevent oil theft, but it was misunderstood as oil theft. There is a safety hazard of an hour's hard work for three vehicles to draw oil once ""If it were not for the tight diesel fuel, I would not be willing to work hard to draw oil back home for storage every day."" said Master Wang. He works on the construction site. He has to go to the construction site early every day. He can finish his work at 6:00 p.m. His family's income depends entirely on these three vehicles. If the engineering vehicle and the crane have no oil, they are just a pile of scrap copper and iron. His family's income is also in vain. Last time, the diesel fuel of the three vehicles was stolen, causing a loss of more than 2000 yuan for fueling. The three vehicles also broke down on the roadside. Later, he asked his grandfather and grandmother to borrow some diesel oil from his colleagues for two hours, and barely drove the three vehicles to a gas station nearby. It was not until the evening that he got the fuel. The work on the construction site was all delayed. One day, I didn't do any work or make any money, and I was scolded by the boss of the construction site. This made him angry. In order to ensure the normal start of the construction site, the first thing Mr. Wang did when he got off work every day was to refuel. Each time he refueled, it took three hours at least and five hours at most. It was really painful to give the diesel oil stolen back to the thief, so he made up his mind that he would have to drain the diesel oil in the fuel tank again, no matter how hard it was, and then drag it back home. ""The fuel tank of the three vehicles can hold 300 liters of diesel oil. It will take at least one hour to drain it all, and six 50 liter oil drums can be filled."" Said Master Wang, drawing oil is a troublesome job. At the beginning, he used a rubber hose to draw oil, but he had to suck with his mouth, which would make him drink diesel oil and make him sick. Later, the oil drawing method was improved, and a self made simple oil pump was used. The simple oil pump is similar to the tool used to beat soy sauce in the past, which relies on human power and is very laborious. ""This little hardship is not enough. After the oil is drawn and loaded into six oil drums every day, it still needs to be pulled back home by a minivan and then put back into the fuel tank the next day."" Mr. Wang and his wife hope that the diesel shortage will end as soon as possible, so that they will not have to suffer this unnecessary hardship. If Mr. Wang works hard every day to drain diesel oil and then drag it home for storage, will it be dangerous to store diesel oil in the civilian house? The reporter interviewed Nanjing Fire Department for this. Fire fighters told reporters that diesel fuel is flammable but not easy to explode. Most diesel flash points are above 60 ℃, and it is not listed in the Catalogue of Dangerous Chemicals, so it does not belong to dangerous chemicals. However, it is certainly not allowed to hoard a large number of diesel fuels, and it is not illegal to store a small amount of diesel fuels in iron containers. However, diesel is flammable after all, so it is still dangerous. If a fire breaks out, the consequences will be unimaginable. So, Mr. Wang had better not move diesel oil back home for storage. Firefighters also told reporters that although diesel oil is heavy oil, it sometimes contains light oil, especially diesel oil refined by some small oil refineries or individual oil refining points, which does not meet the standard and often contains light oil. These substances are easy to volatilize into gas. Once they encounter an open fire, they will burn and explode when they reach the explosion limit. If this diesel oil is stored at home, it is undoubtedly moving a ""time bomb"" back home. Cao Lujie/Wen/Cai"
山寨机成国产手机品质突破绊脚石□本版文、图时报记者杨章玉上周六，金立通信董事长刘立荣在深圳接受时报采访时表示，当前国产手机与洋品牌最大的差距在于品牌，并称国产手机应以品质来突破品牌差距，同时强调当前国产手机以品质突破品牌的最大障碍是山寨机的存在。针对当前手机行业竞争激烈的现状，刘立荣认为，手机行业是一个巨大的可持续行业，手机毛利率最高仍可达50%，厂家只要有优异的产品和突出的经营，仍可在市场上获利不菲。在谈及金立自身时，刘立荣强调，金立不会追求漂亮的销量数据，而是会追求利益的最大化。他透露，金立今年的销量目标锁定800万台，产品策略仍以中端为主，不会下沉到低端市场。品牌成最大差距时报记者：国产手机发展到现在，你觉得它与洋品牌的最大差距是什么？刘立荣：国产手机与洋品牌相比，最大的差距还是在品牌上。我认为国产手机非常不幸，现在很多中高端消费者根本就不去接触国产手机，他们中间买洋品牌手机的居多，其实现在很多国产手机的功能和性价比已经很不错，质量也已做上来。记者：你认为中高端消费者不去接触国产手机的原因是什么？刘立荣：主要有两方面的原因：第一，内地消费者比一些发达地区的消费者更爱面子，他们总觉得买国外品牌的手机比较有面子；第二，由于几年前洋品牌手机质量较国产手机好，吸引了很多中高端消费者，他们已经习惯了某一洋品牌的固有功能和操作界面，再换其他品牌的手机，他们会觉得不太习惯。当然，一些追求手机时尚的消费者除外。严控品质求突破时报记者：在这种情况下，国产手机应该如何扭转消费者的这种习惯，让他们改用国产手机？刘立荣：对国产手机来讲，只有一个突破口，那就是严格把关手机产品的品质，而且是要持续下去；除此之外，也要注重手机产品的人性化设计，使消费者对手机的使用能轻易上手。国产手机千万不能像国产手机行业刚起步的2001年及2002年，当时很多国内消费者改过来买国产手机试一试，可惜当时国产手机只注重销量而没有注重品质，使这批具有经济实力并第一次购买国产手机的消费者大失所望，转而转向购买质量相对较好的洋品牌手机。因此当时国产手机卖得越多，损害的消费者也越多，对国产手机的品牌损害就越大。我认为对国产手机来说，是“前人砍树，后人只能开发”，我们只能一步一个脚印走，树立自己的品牌，逐步靠时间去改变国内消费者的看法。时报记者：金立在手机品质方面有没有什么具体的要求？刘立荣：我们一直非常注重手机产品的品质，并以“金品质，立天下”来要求自己，力图使手机产品的品质不断提高，使更多的消费者使用或再次使用金立手机。	刘立荣,杨章玉	正向	"The imitation mobile phone becomes a stumbling block for the quality breakthrough of domestic mobile phones. □ This edition's text and graphics are reported by Yang Zheyu, a journalist of Times. Last Saturday, Liu Limin, chairman of Goldlog Communication, said in an interview with Times in Shenzhen that the biggest gap between domestic mobile phones and foreign brands is the brand, and that the quality of domestic mobile phones should be used to break through the brand gap. He also stressed that the biggest obstacle for domestic mobile phones to break through brands at present is the existence of imitation mobile phones. In view of the current fierce competition in the mobile phone industry, Liu Limin believes that the mobile phone industry is a huge sustainable industry, and the gross profit margin of mobile phones can still reach 50% at most. If manufacturers have excellent products and outstanding operations, they can still make considerable profits in the market. Speaking of Gionee itself, Liu Limin stressed that Gionee will not pursue beautiful sales figures, but will pursue the maximization of interests. He revealed that Gionee's sales target for this year is locked at 8 million units, and the product strategy is still mainly in the mid-end, not in the low-end market. Times reporter: Now that the domestic mobile phone has developed, what do you think is the biggest gap between it and the foreign brand? Liu Limin: Compared with foreign brands, the biggest gap of domestic mobile phones is still in brand. I think it is very unfortunate that many middle and high-end consumers do not come into contact with domestic mobile phones at all. Most of them buy foreign brand mobile phones. In fact, many domestic mobile phones have very good functions and cost performance, and the quality has also been improved. Reporter: What do you think is the reason why middle and high-end consumers do not touch domestic mobile phones? Liu Limin: There are two main reasons: first, the mainland consumers are more face-saving than consumers in some developed areas. They always think that it is more prestigious to buy mobile phones of foreign brands; Second, because foreign brand mobile phones were better than domestic mobile phones several years ago, it attracted many middle and high-end consumers. They were used to the inherent functions and operation interface of a foreign brand. If they switched to other brands of mobile phones, they would feel uncomfortable. Of course, consumers who pursue mobile phone fashion are not included. Times reporter: In this case, how should domestic mobile phones reverse this habit of consumers and make them switch to domestic mobile phones? Liu Limin: There is only one breakthrough for domestic mobile phones, that is, to strictly control the quality of mobile phone products, and it should continue; In addition, we should also pay attention to the人性化design of mobile phone products, so that consumers can easily get started with mobile phone use. Domestic mobile phones must not be like the domestic mobile phone industry in 2001 and 2002, when it was just starting. At that time, many domestic consumers tried to buy domestic mobile phones. Unfortunately, at that time, domestic mobile phones only focused on sales but not quality, which made a large number of consumers with economic power and the first purchase of domestic mobile phones disappointed, and then turn to buy foreign brand mobile phones of relatively good quality. Therefore, at that time, the more domestic mobile phones were sold, the more consumers were damaged, and the greater the damage to the brand of domestic mobile phones. I think that for domestic mobile phones, ""the foresters cut down trees, and the later generations can only develop"", we can only take one step at a time, establish our own brand, and gradually change the views of domestic consumers with time. Times reporter: Does Gionee have any specific requirements for mobile phone quality? Liu Limin: We have always been very concerned about the quality of mobile phone products, and we have been demanding ourselves with ""gold quality, building the world"", striving to continuously improve the quality of mobile phone products and make more consumers use or reuse Gionee mobile phones."

A-share part of the whole day's trading volume shrank sharply to only about 16 billion yuan (RMB, the same as A-share); The trading volume of H-share part also shrank significantly to about 17.1 billion yuan (Hong Kong dollars, the same as H-shares). The expectation of interest rate hike has not been ""responded"" by the regulatory authorities, and financial stocks generally return. Bank of China (601988-CN; 03988-HK) disclosed the convertible bond plan of 40 billion yuan of A-shares and sought shareholders' authorization to issue A+H shares. The market worries that the launch of its financing plan or the prelude of peers' ""water pumping"" fell by 0.5% and 2.1%; The premium rate of A+H shares (considering the latest exchange rate factor: 1 Hong Kong dollar can be exchanged for 0.87833 yuan) slightly shrinks to 24%. Oil stocks also fell slightly in line with the trend of international oil prices. Metal resources, power and other stocks of A are strong and H is weak; Highway, maritime, building materials and environmental protection stocks mostly rose in H and fell in A, expanding the price spread rate of the two cities. There are considerable losses in the two cities of aviation stocks. Attached are the top ten listed stocks with the lowest premium rate of A+H shares after today's closing: abbreviated name and code of listed stocks-------------------AH premium rate of China Pacific Insurance (601601-CN; 02601-HK)-----(-10.51%) China Ping An (601318-CN; 02318-HK)------(-9.37%) China Life Insurance (601628-CN; 02628-HK)------(-6.14%) Ansteel Shares (000898-CN; 00347-HK)------(-4.25%) China Shenhua (601088-CN; 01088-HK)------(-1.67%) ICBC (601398-CN; 01398-HK)------(-1.43%) Qingdao Beer (600600-CN; 00168-HK)------(-1.36%) China Railway Construction (601186-CN; 01186-HK)------(-1.23%) Conch Cement (600585-CN; 00914-HK)--------1.36% China Merchants Bank (600036-CN; 03968-HK)--------1.75%"

It has its own product line, and the development of any new project will give customers a reason to buy, focusing on meeting customer needs as the core of the whole design plan, and establishing the core selling point of the product, that is, product, quality and integrity. Vanke's ""Golden"" series of boutique residences are committed to creating a sense of belonging to a mature cultural atmosphere by forging refined life details, and guiding the new fashion of urban living with a more avant-garde and modern central living concept. This time, in the west city, North City, the Vanke Group undertook the construction of the west city population evacuation and resettlement housing, and together with the main residence, it took 550000 square meters of land in the resettlement housing area in the east of Shangdi to create a large project - the main residence Vanke · Jinyuhuafu. Vanke sets it as a ""golden"" product, mainly to create a special mansion for IT elites in Zhongguancun and Shangdi areas, to improve their living environment and alleviate the housing pressure in these areas. According to the 2010 statistics, the supply of residential buildings in the core area of Zhongguancun was only 4.5 million square meters, with scarce land resources and too small release, and ""pure"" residential projects were extremely scarce. However, the environment in the East Shangdi area is relatively quiet, suitable for living, and not far from Zhongguancun, with convenient transportation. Subway Line 13, Line 8 and Changping Line can all reach the core business districts such as Zhongguancun, Guoao and Financial Street. If you drive by yourself, you can also reach the above places via Jingzang Expressway and Jingbao Expressway, which is called ""three tracks, double heights and stereo traffic"". Vanke's leader even called the project of the main residence Vanke · Jinyuhuafu ""a thunderbolt in the real estate market"". In his view, the project is located in the East Shangdi area near the Zhongguancun Shangdi Industrial Park and the high-level university area, accommodating many international famous high-tech industries such as Lenovo, Baidu and Founder, and close to the Xicheng school district in the East Shangdi, which can enjoy the high-quality education of Xicheng. It fully reflects the two advantages of the IT circle layer and education supporting facilities in the Beijing North Region. Moreover, there are two major brands of Mainstay and Vanke to escort the project, and the quality of the project itself also perfectly interprets the life of urban elites. The project follows the consistent hard decoration delivery standards of Vanke, with flexible space and high utilization. A unique ""dual core"" spatial planning and landscape design are adopted, which organically combines architecture with landscape. The distance between buildings is 130 meters. Moreover, in the landscape design, a special path is opened up to create a growth paradise for children. There will be graffiti walls, glass word posts,弟子规, Galaxy Solar System, world maps, Three Character Classics and other entertaining facilities for children's play. Of course, there are also facilities suitable for leisure and entertainment of people of different age groups, which shows concern for the whole life cycle. Here, in the midst of noise, we can get a corner of silence and enjoy a quiet life in the midst of prosperity, striving for a beautiful and comfortable living environment. The project has many high-quality medical resources, such as the 309 Hospital of the PLA, the Huilongguan Hospital, and the Qinghe Hospital, which is convenient for medical treatment and physical examination. There are also good places to eat, drink and play. The project is surrounded by large commercial places such as Yong旺International Shopping Center, Xingmei Shopping Center, Xidan Shopping Center Huilongguan Shopping Center, and Huajing Building. The Phase I of the Mainstay Vanke · Jinyuhuafu project mainly promotes two houses and three houses of 85~105, with 1000 sets of houses released at one time. The model room and garden demonstration area have opened. The opening in June is imminent, and the loan can be combined. The reception center is located 500 meters northwest of Huilongguan Bridge, Badaling Expressway. I want to comment on the real estate navigation:"

广东大翻盘让阿联高呼骄傲杜比超强能力令他感叹新浪体育讯　北京时间4月18日消息，在结束了NBA的常规赛之后，易建联立刻马不停蹄的赶回了国内，并且向国家队的主教练邓华德报道，并且和邓华德进行了一次神秘会谈。不过易建联并不会马上和国家队会合一起训练，接下来他将休息半个月，而在这半个月当中，为自己曾经效力的广东队助威总决赛也成为了他日程中最为重要的事情。昨晚，广东队在新疆客场一度落后18分的情况下在第四节上演了惊心动魄的大翻盘，已经抵达北京的易建联也在电视机旁关注了这场比赛。“我看了第二场。”易建联说，“对广东来说，他们打得非常不错，我为他们感到骄傲。昨天的比赛他们第二节一度落后16分，第三节的时候甚至落后了18分，但大家在困难时刻都没有放弃，最后还是赢回来了。我希望他们后面的比赛能够打出更好的表现。”谈到广东队总决赛上的对手新疆队，易建联表示：“新疆队这个赛季确实实力提高了很多，包括内援方面、外援方面，还有替补的实力。应该说总决赛对双方来说都会是一个很大的挑战。”在关注了总决赛前两场之后，阿联也为昆西-杜比超强的得分能力而感叹。他说：“杜比在新疆队确实扮演了一个非常重要的角色，第一场让他拿了53分，确实是对他这一点控制得不太好。第二场让他拿到36分，这就是他常规赛一直保持的一个正常水平，所以对他的控制应该说还是有所提高吧。后面的比赛，防守杜比仍然会是球队的重点任务。”当记者提出让易建联预测一下总决赛的比分时，阿联笑了表说：“预测我还没有想过，因为我会有偏爱，广东是我以前效力的球队，我肯定会更加支持广东。”虽然不愿意对比分做出具体的预测，但阿联还是对后面的比赛进行了展望，他说：“从实力上看，谁能拿最后的总冠军还要看双方的发挥和临场的表现。现在两支球队都各输了一个主场，后面的每一场比赛对双方来说都非常重要。”最后，阿联也对广东队本赛季的表现做出了总结。易建联说：“这个赛季广东队经历了很多的困难，包括朱芳雨和王仕鹏几个老将身上一直有伤，而且大外援(哈里森)也在赛季刚刚开始就受伤了，应该说他们常规赛打得非常不容易，但这这种困难的情况下他们还是打出了非常不错的表现。”接下来，易建联将会前往东莞，观看本赛季的CBA总决赛第四场，并为自己的母队——广东队加油。(贾磊)	朱芳雨,贾磊,哈里森,昆西-杜比,邓华德,易建联,王仕鹏,杜比	正向	"The great turnaround of Guangdong made Alian call him proud. Duby's super ability made him sigh. Sina Sports News On April 18, Beijing time, after the end of the NBA's regular season, Yi Jianlian immediately returned to China without stopping, reported to the head coach of the national team, Deng Huade, and had a mysterious talk with Deng Huade. However, Yi Jianlian will not immediately join the national team for training. In the next half month, he will have a rest. During this half month, cheering for the Guangdong team, where he once played, in the finals has also become the most important thing on his schedule. Last night, the Guangdong team once fell behind by 18 points in the away game in Xinjiang, and staged a thrilling comeback in the fourth quarter. Yi Jianlian, who had arrived in Beijing, also followed this game on TV. ""I watched the second game."" Yi Jianlian said, ""For Guangdong, they played very well, and I am proud of them. Yesterday's game, they fell behind by 16 points in the second quarter, and even fell behind by 18 points in the third quarter, but everyone did not give up at the moment of difficulty, and finally won back. I hope they can play better in the future."" Speaking of Xinjiang team, the opponent of Guangdong team in the finals, Yi Jianlian said: ""Xinjiang team has indeed improved a lot this season, including internal and external aids, and the strength of substitutes. I think the finals will be a big challenge for both sides."" After paying attention to the first two games of the finals, A Lian also感叹Quincy - DuBy's super scoring ability. He said: ""Duobi did play a very important role in Xinjiang. In the first game, he scored 53 points. It was really not good to control him. In the second game, he scored 36 points, which was his normal level in the whole season, so his control should have been improved. In the future, defending Duobi will still be the focus of the team."" When the reporter asked Yi Jianlian to predict the score of the finals, A Lian smiled and said: ""I haven't thought about prediction, because I will have a preference. Guangdong is the team I used to play for, so I will definitely support Guangdong more."" Although he was unwilling to make a specific forecast of the score, A Lian also looked forward to the future game, and he said: ""In terms of strength, who can win the championship will depend on the performance of both sides and their performance on the spot. Now both teams have lost a home court, so the next game is very important for both sides."" Finally, A Lian also summed up the performance of Guangdong Team this season. Yi Jianlian said: ""This season, the Guangdong team has experienced a lot of difficulties, including the fact that several veterans, such as Zhu Fangyu and Wang Shipeng, have been injured all the time, and the major foreign aid (Harrison) was also injured at the beginning of the season. They played very hard in the regular season, but they still played very well under this kind of difficulty."" Next, Yi Jianlian will go to Dongguan to watch the fourth game of the CBA finals this season and cheer for his mother team - Guangdong Team. (Jialei)"
topview：股市将如何发展指南针姜都锋昨日中国股市经历了从跌3%到涨3%的逆转，全球股市也在各国救市的利好前提下出现了好转，香港恒生指数大涨10%，新加坡海峡时报指数大涨5%，英国融时报指数大涨8.26%，德国DAX30种股价指数大涨11.%。而美国道琼斯指数更是创下历史最高单日上涨点数，上涨了936点，涨幅11%。在全球股市普涨的局面下，我国又会向何处出发展呢？通过指南针赢富数据显示，上周周五基金大举建仓，当日建仓资金净流入24.81亿。资产管理机构也将一味的做空变成了少量的调仓。应该说这一动作说明阳光机构对后市是比较乐观的。从指南针动态TOP显示，本周一主力资金仍在大举的建仓中国股市，加之大盘连续下跌，昨日大盘发生惊天大逆转也就是正常了。指南针TOP板大盘风向标显示资金的进场数量和持续性都达到了近期的巨量。可以看到，大盘风向标中显示资金已经达到了1天、3天、5天、10天全部做多的状态。那么当全球股市全部大涨，中国股市资金大举介入的时候，未来大盘的方向将怎么走呢？应该说盲目的乐观是不应该的。我们应该看到当前行情的主要趋势是震荡行情，行情趋势的改变首先是要有资金的改变。通过指南针动态TOP软件的显示，今日(周二)大盘风向标出现了主力资金却在大涨之后出逃的迹象，看来主力对未来的行情并不是十分看好。才出现了今天主力逢高派发的动作。	姜都锋	正向	Topview: The stock market will develop. The指南compass Jiang Dufeng experienced a reversal from a 3% decline to a 3% increase yesterday. The Chinese stock market also improved under the good conditions of saving the market in various countries. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index surged 10%, the Singapore Strait Times Index surged 5%, and the British Rong Financial Times Index surged 8.26%. The German DAX30 stock price index soared 11%. The Dow Jones Index in the United States even hit a record high of 936 points, up 11%. In the face of the general rise of the global stock market, where will our country go for development? According to the data from the Compass Yingfu, the fund made a huge position on Friday last week, with a net inflow of 2.481 billion yuan on the day. Asset management institutions have also turned shorting into a small amount of adjustment. It can be said that this move shows that the Sunshine Organization is optimistic about the future market. From the dynamic TOP display of the compass, the main force is still building a position in the Chinese stock market on Monday, coupled with the continuous decline of the market, it is normal that the market made a huge reversal yesterday. The top board of the compass's top board shows that the amount and continuity of funds entering the market have reached a huge recent volume. It can be seen that the money in the market has reached the state of being long for 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 10 days. Then, when the global stock market is all up and the Chinese stock market funds are making a big intervention, how will the future direction of the market go? It should not be blindly optimistic. We should see that the main trend of the current market is the volatile market, and the change of the market trend should first be changed by funds. Through the display of the dynamic TOP software of the Compass, the market trend indicator (Tuesday) showed that the main force was fleeing after a sharp rise, which seems that the main force is not very optimistic about the future market. It was only today that the main force took the action of distributing at a high level.
猛龙新秀挤走功勋老臣马刺领衔5球队追求欧洲之王新浪体育讯　北京时间6月28日，据《环球邮报》消息，猛龙在选秀大会上挑走了德马尔-德罗赞后，队中元老安东尼-帕克已经没有了位置，他离队的可能性很大。目前已经有多支球队追逐帕克。帕克在7月1日即将成为自由球员，他已经34岁，是一位经验丰富的得分后卫。帕克上一份3年1200万的合同今年到期，他希望在职业生涯的晚期，得到一份尽可能大的合同。一位内部人士透露，至少有5支球队向猛龙就帕克进行了询价，包括马刺，凯尔特人，太阳，骑士和雷霆。就现在的情况看，帕克找到新东家不是难事。猛龙已经向新秀德罗赞许诺了出场时间，他们还向德尔菲诺开出报价合同。另外帕克回到欧洲联赛的可能性也很大。帕克在最初几个NBA不成功的赛季，前往欧洲淘金，却在以色列联赛取得生工，入选欧洲联赛50大巨星，并连续两赛季拿到MVP，被称为欧洲之王。(迪哥)	安东尼-帕克,德尔菲诺,德马尔-德罗赞,迪哥,帕克	正向	Raptors' rookie squeezed out the meritorious old minister Spurs led 5 teams to pursue the King of Europe Sina Sports News On June 28, Beijing time, according to the Globe Post, after the Raptors picked DeMar DeRozan in the draft, the team's veteran Anthony Parker had no place, and it was very likely that he would leave the team. At present, many teams have been chasing Parker. Parker will become a free agent on July 1, he is 34 years old and an experienced shooting guard. Parker's last contract of $12 million for 3 years expired this year, and he hoped to get a contract as large as possible in the late stage of his career. An insider revealed that at least five teams, including the Spurs, the Celtics, the Suns, the Cavaliers and the Thunder, had asked the Raptors about Parker. Judging from the current situation, it is not difficult for Parker to find a new job. The Raptors have promised the rookie DeRozan playing time, and they have also offered a quote contract to Delfino. Besides, Parker is likely to return to the European League.

新疆警方：高考招生5大陷阱需设防6月27日，乌鲁木齐市公安局发出预警提醒高考考生和家长：警惕五大陷阱、谨防上当受骗。一、招生陷阱针对家长都希望自己的孩子能进名校就读的心理，骗子往往设置4类陷阱：“名校”变“民办”。骗子通常许诺可以让高三毕业生到名校学习，但在接受“关系费”、“赞助费”后，却将学生安排到交钱就能上的民办高校；“艺校”变“艺班”。骗子吹嘘可以帮助考生进入艺校，从而骗取高额“好处费”，最后却将学生送进私人开办的艺术辅导班。“军校”特招。骗子以部队首长亲属、朋友的身份自居，或者干脆自称高级军官，谎称手中握有某某军校的特招生名额，在收受钱财后溜之大吉。“点招”吸引。骗子利用考生和家长对试点高校“点招”政策不了解的弱点，极力渲染其中的“黑幕”，以帮助毕业生取得“点招”名额为名，实施诈骗。二、招工陷阱一些考生在高考之后即外出打工，针对这类学生，骗子常常以职业介绍所、职业中介人名义设置3类陷阱。收费不介绍：骗子收取毕业生高额打工介绍费后逃之夭夭；预留试用期：承诺给予高薪，以试用的名义廉价利用毕业生的劳动力；乱收费：编造各种名义收取费用，如风险抵押金、培训费、置装费、建档费等。三、网络陷阱学生参加高考后，上网的时间多了，但对是非的辨别、对不良信息的抵制能力相对较弱，易沉迷于网络色情。四、“哥们儿”陷阱现在的高三毕业生多为“90后”，具有强烈的好奇心，易冲动，高考后，管理上也处于“放羊”状态。此时，一些高三毕业生误交不良社会青年，并为了“哥们儿”义气，做出寻衅滋事、聚众斗殴等违法行为。五、传销陷阱骗子往往以高三毕业生的亲朋好友或老乡面目出现，鼓动毕业生利用等待录取通知书的时间赚大钱，以高额回报、快速致富为诱饵，进行诱骗。针对这五种情况，公安机关在加强打击违法犯罪分子的同时，提醒广大家长、考生：首先，要通过正常渠道报考高校，不给不法分子以可乘之机；其次，要认真甄别各类中介的真伪，不要“病急乱投医”；最后，家长要加强对考生的监管，防止其上当受骗及违法犯罪。		负向	"Xinjiang police: five traps in the college entrance examination recruitment need to be guarded against. On June 27, the Public Security Bureau of Urumqi City issued a warning to remind college entrance examination candidates and parents: beware of five traps and be careful not to be cheated. 1. The招生trap targets the psychology of parents who hope their children can study in famous schools. Scammers often set four traps: ""famous schools"" change to ""private"". Scammers usually promise to let高三graduates study in famous schools, but after receiving ""relationship fees"" and ""sponsorship fees"", they arrange students to go to private universities where they can pay; ""Art School"" changes to ""Art Class"". Scammers boast that they can help candidates enter art schools in order to get huge ""benefits"", but finally send students to privately run art tutoring classes. ""Military Academy"" special recruitment. Scammers often claim to be relatives, friends or simply senior officers of military leaders, lying that they have special student quotas in their hands of a certain military academy, and then run away with money. ""Point recruitment"" attraction. Scammers take advantage of the weakness of candidates and parents that they do not know the ""point recruitment"" policy of pilot universities, and尽力render the ""black curtain"" in it in order to help graduates get the ""point recruitment"" quota, and then commit fraud. 2. Job recruitment trap Some candidates go out to work after the college entrance examination. For these students, scammers often set three traps in the name of vocational introduction offices and vocational intermediaries. No introduction for charging: The scammer runs away after charging graduates a high job introduction fee; Reserve probation: Promise to give high salary and use graduates' labor at a low price in the name of probation;乱Charge: Fabricate various names to collect fees, such as risk mortgage, training fees, dressing fees, file building fees, etc. 3. Network trap After students take the college entrance examination, they have more time to surf the Internet, but they have relatively weak ability to distinguish right from wrong and resist bad information, and they are easy to be addicted to online sex. 4. ""Buddy"" trap The current graduates of Grade 3 are mostly ""post 90s"", with strong curiosity and impulsiveness. After the college entrance examination, the management is also in a state of ""sheep releasing"". At this time, some高三graduates make friends with bad young people in society, and in order to ""buddy"" righteousness, they commit illegal acts such as provoking troubles and fighting. 5. Pyramid selling trap Scammers often appear as relatives, friends or fellow townspeople of the高三graduates, inciting graduates to make money while waiting for the admission notice, using high returns and rapid wealth as bait to lure. In view of these five situations, while the public security organ is strengthening the fight against criminals, it also reminds parents and candidates: first, they should apply for universities through normal channels, so as not to give criminals any chance; second, they should carefully identify the authenticity of various intermediaries, and do not ""give doctors in a hurry when they are seriously ill""; Finally, parents should strengthen their supervision of the examinees to prevent them from being deceived and committing crimes."
京城高中“出国班”开设中国文化课北京考试报讯在京城部分示范高中国际班上，学生除了学习国际课程，中国文化课也是很重要的一部分。据悉，在京城的高中“出国班”几乎都开设了中国文化课。北大附中国际部国际课程与中国文化课并重，除国际课程外，中国语言及文学、中国历史及政治等课程，学生也要学。十一学校国际部的学生同样要学历史、地理等课程。首师大附中中美实验班的学生可在艺术、语言与文学、人文与社会等五大学习领域选修申请美国大学所需课程。“出国学生要了解世界文化艺术的基本常识，但不能忘记中国历史、地理的基本知识。”在四中、八中等示范高中的“出国班”里，为了让学生更有针对性地准备出国考试，学校特意为学生量身定做了相关课程。学校除安排数学、语文等基础课、会考课程外，还额外开设中西艺术鉴赏、中国历史和地理等课程。十一学校国际部副主任周斌说，中国文化是学生的根。国际部要招收“志在出国”的优秀学生，把他们培养成国际型人才。同时，学生只有学习中国文化，将来走出国门后，才能更好传播祖国优秀文化。连自己国家、民族的历史、文化都不了解，出国何以立足。业内人士认为，高中开展中外合作教育，适应了时代发展的需要。再过几年，一流人才应是具有“国际化背景、世界眼光、中国灵魂”的人物。据了解，示范高中里的“出国班”有两种，一种是根据学生和家长需求，在高三时为留学生单独设置，班上的高三生基本只参加会考申请国外高校；另一种是国际班。高中与国外中学合作或引进国外中学课程。学生从高一便学习国外课程，高三毕业直接申请国外高校。部分高中两种班兼有。(记者：马海丽)	马海丽,周斌	正向	"The ""going abroad class"" of Beijing High School opened a course on Chinese culture Beijing Examination News In some model senior high schools in Beijing, in addition to learning international courses, students also pay attention to learning Chinese culture. It is reported that the ""going abroad class"" of high schools in Beijing has almost opened Chinese culture courses. The international department of the International Department of Peking University attaches equal importance to the international curriculum and Chinese culture. In addition to the international curriculum, students also need to learn Chinese language and literature, Chinese history and politics. Students in the International Department of No. 11 School also need to learn history, geography and other courses. The students of the China-US experimental class of the High School Attached to Capital Normal University can choose the courses required by American universities in five major fields of study, such as art, language and literature, and humanities and society. ""Students going abroad should know the basic common sense of world culture and art, but they should not forget the basic knowledge of Chinese history and geography."" In the ""going abroad class"" of model high schools such as No. 4 Middle School and No. 8 Middle School, in order to make students better prepared for the examinations abroad, the school has tailored relevant courses for students. In addition to arranging basic courses such as mathematics and Chinese, and examination courses, the school also provides additional courses such as Chinese and Western art appreciation, Chinese history and geography. Zhou Bin, deputy director of the International Department of No. 11 School, said that Chinese culture is the root of students. The international department should recruit excellent students who are ""aiming at going abroad"" and train them into international talents. At the same time, only by learning Chinese culture, students can better spread the excellent culture of the motherland after going abroad in the future. If you don't know the history and culture of your own country and nation, how can you stand out in going abroad. Industry insiders believe that the development of international cooperation education in high schools is in line with the needs of the times. In a few years, first-class talents should be people with ""international background, global perspective and Chinese soul"". It is understood that there are two kinds of ""going abroad classes"" in model high schools, one is set up separately for students in the third year of high school according to the needs of students and parents. The students in the class basically only participate in the examination to apply for foreign universities; The other is the international class. High schools cooperate with or introduce foreign secondary school courses. Students start learning foreign courses from senior high school and apply directly to foreign universities when they graduate from senior high school. Some high schools have both classes.

南钢四大主力仍拒绝续约高层辟谣：从没想拖合同作为南钢五虎将之一，4日晚上，杨力与俱乐部草签了新赛季合同。于是，网上传言，南钢剩余主力队员行将就范，本周内俱乐部将一一搞定所有合同。昨天，经过本报记者多方采访，得出的结果却与网上传言大相径庭，俱乐部与剩余四将的博弈仍在继续，双方都无让步迹象。这样下去，唐正东、胡雪峰、易立和孟达四大主力缺席新赛季首场与东莞的比赛不无可能。博弈继续球员没有妥协的意思昨天某网站报道，江苏几大主力球员已经准备向南钢俱乐部妥协，并引用了一名球员的话：“就这样一份合同放在你面前，你签不签？都到这时候了，你说我们还能怎么办？”文章说，俱乐部此前采取的“各个击破”和“消耗战”都在联赛开始前一周起到了效果，“都到这份上了，能不签吗？”在这样一种情况下，球员的无奈可想而知。文中还引用了南钢俱乐部总经理王敏的话：“目前就剩下三位主力的合同还没有签订，但我们谈得不错，应该说这两天全部球员就能够签约了。”文章称，无论球员有多么不情愿，他们黑笔写下的大名最终还是要落在那份在他们看来的“不平等条约”上。实际情况真的如网文说的那样吗？昨晚，记者分别拨通了几位当事球员的电话，得到的回答同样的斩钉截铁：“我们没有妥协的意思，如果不能与俱乐部就一些细节达成一致，新赛季的第一场比赛我们很可能不打了。”主力队员孟达的话代表了几位主力的态度：“我们也等着俱乐部来跟我们沟通，现在整个工资盘子已经定了，薪水我们也就不争论了。但比如伤病等不可抗拒因素的细节问题还要等待俱乐部的明确，成绩指标上我们也有分歧，如果大唐真得不打了，第三名的成绩指标我们肯定不能接受。”记者了解到，由于几位主力球员的态度比较坚决，南钢俱乐部相关领导昨天放弃了去南钢宾馆与球员谈判。而一些媒体报道的易立和胡雪峰基本接受俱乐部合同一说，并不确切。胡雪峰、易立和孟达三人与俱乐部关于合同的博弈仍在继续，如果劳资双方各不让步，几大主力缺席新赛季首场比赛不无可能，当然，这是我们极不情愿看到的一幕。高层喊冤王敏：“从没想过拖合同”昨天，网上的一篇文章激怒了南钢俱乐部总经理王敏，这篇网文说，俱乐部总经理王敏是一种胜利者的姿态，“我们争取这两三天与他们签约，我想一定会有一个不错的结果的。”该文还称，俱乐部方面多次找球员谈实际上就是个幌子，俱乐部的说法是，“你们签不签无所谓，最后大家还是可以做朋友的。”实际上就是给球员某种“高处不胜寒”的感觉。对于这种不负责任的说法，王敏予以了强烈谴责：“首先我要申明，俱乐部与球员包括教练组关于合同谈判的态度是诚恳的，合同拖到现在没有解决，俱乐部非常着急，根本不像一些媒体说的，俱乐部无所谓，等比赛开打了，球员自然签合同。“其次，我昨天下午还与易立、胡雪峰进行了沟通，尽管一些细节双方还有分歧，但俱乐部的态度很积极。球员的一些顾虑我们也理解，俱乐部内部也在协商，争取早日解决合同问题，毕竟联赛马上开打，再拖下去，势必影响南钢新赛季的成绩。最后，俱乐部接下来几天肯定要重点解决合同的问题，决不会任凭事情发展到影响首场比赛的程度。”明天，南钢俱乐部将举行新赛季新闻发布会，王总的期望是：“争取在发布会之前解决合同问题，让所有队员全身心地投入到新赛季中去。”本报记者刁勇	唐正东,刁勇,易立,胡雪峰,杨力,王敏,孟达	负向	"The four main players of Nansteel still refused to renew their contracts. The top management discredited the rumors. As one of the five tigers of Nansteel, Yang Li signed the new season contract with the club on the evening of the 4th. As a result, the Internet rumor has it that the remaining main players of Nansteel will be disciplined, and the club will get all the contracts done within this week. Yesterday, after the reporter of this newspaper interviewed many people, the result was quite different from the rumors on the Internet. The game between the club and the remaining four players was still going on, and neither side gave in. If this goes on, it is possible that the four main players, Tang Zhengdong, Hu Xuefeng, Yi Li and Mengda, will be absent from the first game of the new season with Dongguan. The game continued and the players did not mean to compromise. Yesterday, a website reported that several major players in Jiangsu were ready to compromise with the Nansteel Club, and quoted a player as saying: ""Put a contract in front of you, will you sign it or not? At this point, what can we do?"" The article said that the ""divide and conquer"" and ""war of attrition"" adopted by the club had an effect in the week before the start of the league. ""At this point, can we not sign it?"" Under such circumstances, the helplessness of the players can be imagined. The article also quoted Wang Min, the general manager of Nansteel Club as saying: ""At present, the contracts of three main players have not been signed, but we have a good talk, and I think all the players will be able to sign the contracts in the past two days."" The article said that no matter how unwilling the players were, their names written in black would eventually fall on the ""unequal treaty"" in their view. Is the actual situation really like what the online text says? Last night, the reporter dialed the telephone of several players concerned, and got the same answer: ""We have no intention of giving in. If we can not reach an agreement with the club on some details, we may not play in the first game of the new season."" The words of Mengda, the main player, represent the attitude of several main players: ""We are also waiting for the club to communicate with us. Now the whole salary plate has been set, so we will not argue about the salary. However, the detailed problems such as irresistible factors such as injuries still need to wait for the club's clarification. We also have differences on performance indicators. If Datang really doesn't play, we will never accept the performance indicators of the third place."" The reporter learned that the leaders of Nansteel Club gave up going to Nansteel Hotel to negotiate with the players yesterday because several main players were very firm in their attitude. However, the media reports that Yili and Hu Xuefeng have basically accepted the club's contract, which is not accurate. Hu Xuefeng, Yi Li and Mengda's game with the club about the contract is still going on. If the capital and labor do not give in to each other, it is possible that the main players will be absent from the first game of the new season, which is certainly a scene we do not want to see. The top leadership shouted injustice to Wang Min: ""I never thought of dragging the contract"" Yesterday, an online article infuriated Wang Min, the general manager of Nansteel. This article said that the general manager of the club, Wang Min, was a winner. ""We will try to sign contracts with them in these two or three days, and I think there will be a good result."" The article also said that the club's repeated attempts to find players to talk about was actually a bluff. The club said, ""It doesn't matter whether you sign or not. We can still be friends in the end."" In fact, it gives players a sense of ""high places are not cold"". Wang Min strongly condemned the irresponsible remarks: ""First of all, I would like to state that the club, including the coaching group, is sincere about the contract negotiation with the players. The contract has not been solved up to now, and the club is very anxious. It is totally different from what some media say. The club doesn't care. When the game starts, the players will naturally sign a contract."" Secondly, I also communicated with Yi Li and Hu Xuefeng this afternoon, and although there were some differences between the two sides on some details, the attitude of the club was very positive. We also understand some concerns of the players, and the club is also negotiating internally to solve the contract problem as soon as possible. After all, the league will start soon. If we delay further, it will inevitably affect the performance of Nansteel in the new season. Finally, the club must focus on solving the contract problem in the next few days, and will never let things develop to the point of affecting the first game."" Tomorrow, Nansteel Club will hold a press conference for the new season, and President Wang hopes: ""To solve the contract problem before the press conference and let all the players fully devote themselves to the new season.""

网帖曝高校女生留宿男友宿舍近1年本报讯(记者罗义实习生刘菲黄金)近日，一名为“武汉某高校惊现厚脸女！与其男友在宿舍共住近一年，已逼走两位室友！”的帖子在国内各大网站论坛疯狂转载。该帖中提到，武昌某重点高校男生宿舍内，一男生的女友不仅擅自留宿长达一年，甚至在男生宿舍内开起了“夫妻网店”。由于两人“交往甚密”，“逼走”了另外两名本应在该寝室住宿的男生，在校内造成了很坏的影响。天涯网曝光帖4天点击58万次帖子中描述，该女子与其男友“晚睡晚起，相拥而眠”，每天的“主业”是在淘宝网开网店和为某网络游戏开私服。据该帖内容反映，留宿女子的男友基本不去上课，不出门活动，考试作弊，而留宿女子更是被发帖人列举了包括“直接在男生寝室上厕所”在内的十多条罪状。此外，该帖还附有两人在寝室睡觉时的照片，但照片十分模糊，从角度看，均是在门外偷拍的。发帖人称，其辅导员和书记都曾找当事人谈话，但没有效果。网上发帖是因为实在没有办法，想公之于众以解决问题。该贴经国内众多网站论坛转载，其中仅天涯论坛该帖4天来的点击率就超过58万次。在网友回复中记者看到，绝大多数网友对留宿女子和其男友的行为表示鄙视，甚至要求“人肉”该女子，有近三分之一的网友对该校宿舍管理水平表示质疑。也有部分网友认为，人们应该理性些，不要苛责学校，更不要辱骂当事的学生，“给他们改过自新的机会吧”。自称当事人校内BBS发帖澄清昨日下午，记者浏览该学校BBS发现，署名为“xiangjuzi”的网友在18日凌晨发帖称，“作为当事人之一，有几个问题我必须澄清。”该帖子对这对学生情侣身份进行了证实，以当事人的身份，对“武汉某高校惊现厚脸女！与其男友在宿舍共住近一年，已逼走两位室友！”帖子中部分有出入的观点进行了反驳后表示，“其余与事实相符”。“事件男主角已经承诺向我们道歉，可能就在近期将出去租房，女生已于近日回山东老家。”“xiangjuzi”表示，“我们三个当事男生未能及时表明立场，致使事件恶化，对此我们也负有一定的责任。”他希望，此事不要影响到学校声誉，并强调，“毕竟有点挑战道德底线的感觉，但是绝对没有部分网友臆测的那些不堪行为，请各位自重。”“女孩20多天前已搬走”昨日下午1时许，在该校4号男宿舍楼栋管理员处记者了解到，帖中所提及的男宿舍不在4号楼，而是7号楼306室。随后记者来到7号楼宿舍，楼栋管理员告诉记者，“那个女孩20多天前就已经搬走了。”该管理员承认帖子中提到的女生曾住在306男生宿舍的事实，但她称，“那个女生时来时不来，并非帖中所述的那么长时间。”管理员称，该事发生后，学校相关领导已对这对学生情侣做过工作，该宿舍原本住有4名男生，面积相对十分宽敞。搬出去住的两名学生是自愿外出租房，并非被这对学生情侣“逼”走。链接网帖细数“厚脸女”罪状原文1.直接在男生寝室上厕所；2.半年来没见过女的洗衣服、做饭、做清洁；3.没见过该女有任何underwear(内衣)晾晒在寝室附近；4.夏天在男生寝室楼解决洗澡问题；5.不参加所有期末考试；6.半年里离开男生宿舍的总时间估计不到200小时；7.几乎从不跟除她男友以外的人说话；8.两人从来都是在一张床上睡，也不拉个帘子；9.霸占他人电脑，主人回来盯着电脑也毫无感觉，继续霸占；10.辅导员找其男友谈话时仍然能够如入无人之境地上网；11.跟辅导员表示以后再也不来之后的第三天继续恢复原来的一切；12.两个室友不堪滋扰搬走后丝毫没有任何表示；13.还有很多……	罗义,刘菲	负向	"A recent post entitled ""Amazing thick skinned woman appears in a university in Wuhan! She has lived with her boyfriend in the dormitory for nearly a year, and has forced two roommates away!"" has been疯狂ly reprinting on major websites and forums in China. The post mentioned that in the dormitory of male students of a key university in Wuchang, a male's girlfriend not only stayed for a whole year without permission, but also opened a ""couple's online shop"" in the male dormitory. Because the two ""interact very closely"", ""forced away"" two other boys who should have lived in the dormitory, causing bad influence in the school. Tianya Net Exposure Post 4 has been clicked 580000 times. The post describes that the woman and her boyfriend ""sleep late and get up late, hugging each other to sleep"", and their ""main business"" every day is to open an online shop on Taobao and open a private server for a certain online game. According to the post, the boyfriend of the woman who stays overnight basically does not go to class, does not go out to activities, and cheats in exams, while the woman who stays overnight is listed by the poster, including ""going to the toilet directly in the boys' dormitory"". In addition, the post also attaches a photo of the two sleeping in the dormitory, but the photo is very blurred, and it is secretly shot at the door from the perspective. The poster said that his tutor and secretary had talked with the parties concerned, but it was ineffective. The reason for posting online is that there is really no way to make it public to solve the problem. The post was reprinted by many domestic websites and forums, and the click rate of the post on Tianya Forum alone has exceeded 580000 in the past four days. In the reply of netizens, the reporter saw that the vast majority of netizens expressed contempt for the woman who stayed overnight and her boyfriend, and even asked for ""human flesh"" of the woman. Nearly one third of netizens questioned the management level of the school's dormitories. Some netizens also believe that people should be more rational, not to blame the school, or to insult the students involved, ""give them a chance to repent"". The self proclaimed party posted on the school BBS yesterday afternoon to clarify. At about 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the reporter learned from the administrator of the male dormitory building No. 4 of the school that the male dormitory mentioned in the post was not building No. 4, but Room 306, building No. 7. Later, the reporter came to the No.7 building dormitory, and the building administrator told the reporter, ""The girl moved away more than 20 days ago."" The administrator admitted that the girl mentioned in the post had lived in the male dormitory of 306, but she said, ""The girl did not come when she did, not as long as the post said."" The administrator said that after the incident, the school leaders had done a lot of work with the student couple, and the dormitory originally had four male students, which was very spacious. The two students who moved out to live were willing to rent a house outside, not ""forced"" by the student couple. Link: The original text of the online post lists the crimes of ""Thick Face Girl"" 1. Go to the toilet directly in the boys' dormitory; 2.

Sun Xiaowen, a reporter of this newspaper/figure who became famous for his play such as ""Days with Youth"" and ""Struggle"", has become the spokesman of ""post-80s"". However, off the screen, he is a family man who is troubled by buying a house and supports his wife and daughter. Yesterday, the article appeared in Shanghai with the crew of the TV play ""Snail House"". Speaking of the fact that many people in ""Snail House"" face marriage problems, he said seriously: ""My marriage is not a problem."" The reason why he said so in public is that there are rumors recently that the article and his wife Ma Yili have ""marriage change"". In this regard, the article sneered: ""I don't care about these inexplicable fake news."" The article said that his married life was very happy. At home, he is in charge of the outside world, and Ma Yili is both in charge of the outside world and the inside world. Once upon a time, he was too busy. His daughter didn't want him to see him, so he specifically reflected on himself and arranged more time to accompany his wife and children. When a reporter asked him if he thought he was a good father, he confidently answered: ""I hope you have a chance to ask my daughter this question, and she will say I am a good father."" The article said that his understanding of ""post-80s"" men is that they dare to challenge themselves and take responsibility. He admitted that his roles have their own shadow and his view on love. In ""Snail House"", his girlfriend who loved him to death faces the temptation of interests in reality and eventually abandons him. The article shows understanding of ""her"": ""Everyone may not get married and have children after going through a love affair. They can grow old and white as long as they persist in their hearts. I believe that after experiencing such a setback, they will meet more suitable people."" Recently, the article has just finished shooting the film ""Ocean Paradise"" with Li Lianjie. That was Li Lianjie's first film of ""abandoning Wu from Wen"", which was filmed by Du Kefeng and starred by Wen, Gwei Lunmei and others. However, speaking of this film, the article has a little regret: ""Every young actor will dream of having a nice fight with Li Lianjie, but unfortunately, this is a literary film without fighting.""

骗子花700元办假证骗走朋友80万现金骗人者已被警方刑拘本报吉林讯（记者姜彦艳通讯员高明众刘义平）用700元办的假证，从朋友手里骗来80万现金。磐石市公安局日前破获了一起特大合同诈骗案。受骗人老张是磐石市一家餐饮服务公司的法人代表。2008年12月，老张的好友找到老张，并介绍给他一位自己的朋友。好友说，这个开公司的朋友叫王显奎，是经营农用物资的，公司名叫吉林省磐石市伯洋农业科技有限公司，因资金周转问题想向老张借点钱，并提出支付利息。老张碍于情面应了下来，并提出用对方位于磐石市富太镇的房产做抵押。王显奎开始表示为难，后来也应允了下来。老张拿到王显奎公司的房屋产权证和土地使用证后，分别于2008年12月和2009年1月两次共借给了王显奎现金80万元。今年8月中旬，还款日期到了，老张准备向王显奎要钱。可他不但没要到钱，反而得到了伯洋农业科技有限公司的房产已被王显奎卖掉的消息。老张纳闷，“房产证、土地证都在我手里，房子怎么被卖掉？”再打电话联系王显奎，却发现对方已经关机了。老张这才觉得，自己受骗了。他先拿出王显奎抵押给自己的房产证、土地证来到了磐石市房产交易中心，经核实自己手里的房产证编号都对，可证件是假的，而此房产也真的被转让给沈阳市一家公司的磐石分公司了。证实受骗后，老张向磐石市公安局报了警。磐石警方在接到老张的报警后，迅速组织警力展开侦破工作，当天便将犯罪嫌疑人王显奎抓捕。经讯问，王显奎交代，近年来由于经营不善欠下大量外债，基本靠着拆东墙补西墙维持脆弱的资金链，在通过朋友向老张借钱时得知老张需要自己公司的房产作为抵押后，便到长春市通过做假证件的以350元一个的价格花了700元分别制作了假的房屋产权证和土地使用证，以此假证在老张处骗来80万现金。目前，王显奎已被磐石警方刑事拘留，案件在进一步审理当中。	姜彦艳,高明众,王显奎,刘义平,老张	负向	"The liar spent 700 yuan on a fake certificate to defraud a friend of 800000 yuan. The liar has been detained by the police. Jilin News (Reporter Jiang Yan Yan, Correspondent Gao Mingzhong Liu Yiping) used a 700 yuan fake certificate to defraud 800000 yuan in cash from his friend. The Public Security Bureau of Panstone recently cracked a huge contract fraud case. Zhang, the victim, is the legal representative of a catering service company in Baoji City. In December 2008, Mr. Zhang's friend found Mr. Zhang and introduced him to one of his friends. The friend said that the friend who opened the company was called Wang Xuanqiu. He was engaged in agricultural materials. The company was called Jilin Panstone Boyang Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. Because of the problem of capital circulation, he wanted to borrow some money from Mr. Zhang and proposed to pay interest. Zhang was caught in a dilemma and agreed, and proposed to use the property of Futaizhen, Panstone City as a mortgage. Wang Xuanqiu first said it was difficult, and later agreed. After Mr. Zhang got the house property certificate and land use certificate of Mr. Wang Xuanqiu's company, he lent Mr. Wang Xuanqiu 800000 yuan in cash twice in December 2008 and January 2009 respectively. In mid August of this year, the repayment date was due, and Mr. Zhang was ready to ask Wang Xuanqiu for money. But he didn't get the money, but he got the news that the property of Boyang Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. had been sold by Wang Xuanqiu. Zhang was puzzled. ""How can the house be sold when I have the property certificate and land certificate in my hands?"" When he called Wang Xuanqiu again, he found that the other party had turned off his mobile phone. At this moment, Mr. Zhang realized that he had been cheated. He first took the property certificate and land certificate mortgaged by Wang Xuanqiu to the Panstone City Real Estate Trading Center. After verification, the property certificate number in his hand was correct, but the certificate was fake, and the property was really transferred to the Panstone Branch of a company in Shenyang. After confirming that he had been cheated, Mr. Zhang reported it to the Public Security Bureau of Baoji City. After receiving the alarm from Mr. Zhang, the Baoji police quickly organized police forces to launch an investigation. On the same day, they arrested the criminal suspect Wang Xuanqiu. After interrogation, Wang Xuanqiu confessed that in recent years, due to poor management, he owed a large amount of foreign debts, and basically relied on dismantling the east wall to make up for the fragile capital chain. When he learned from his friend that Mr. Zhang needed the property of his company as a mortgage while borrowing money from Mr. Zhang, he went to Changchun to make fake documents and spent 700 yuan at 350 yuan each to make fake house property certificates and land use certificates respectively, and used this fake certificate to defraud 800000 yuan in cash from Mr. Zhang. At present, Wang Xuanqiu has been criminally detained by the police in Panstone City, and the case is under further trial."
北京晚报：网瘾者免责是天大误解11月8日，我国首部《网络成瘾诊断标准》通过专家论证，将由解放军总后勤部卫生部报批国家卫生部后，在全国各大医院，特别是三甲级医院的精神科推广使用。该标准将网络成瘾分为网络游戏成瘾、网络色情成瘾、网络关系成瘾、网络信息成瘾、网络交易成瘾五类，网络成瘾被纳入精神疾病范畴。根据《诊断标准》的描述，网瘾最直观的一项量化标准是平均每日连续使用网络时间达到或超过6个小时，且符合症状标准已达到或超过3个月。其他标准还有对网络有强烈渴求或冲动；减少或停止上网时会出现周身不适、烦躁、易激怒、注意力不集中、睡眠障碍等戒断反应；因使用网络而减少或放弃了其他的兴趣、娱乐或社交活动等。负责该课题的北京军区总医院医学成瘾科主任陶然表示，这个标准是他们4年来对3000多人进行研究之后得出的结论。如果该标准获得最终确认，我国就将是全世界第一个将网瘾列为精神疾病的国家。“中国戒除网瘾第一人”陶宏开教授公开反对《诊断标准》。根据自己对5000多个案例的研究，陶宏开表示：“网瘾不是病，更不是犯罪。我坚决反对把网瘾青少年当做精神病人治疗，给患网瘾的孩子扣上‘精神病’的帽子。”在网友中，支持者认为：“网瘾被定性为一种疾病，只代表我们以后会更专业更正式更全面地去考虑上网所引起的行为障碍，对于网络所带来的消极后果有更科学的方法去预防以及控制。”而反对者认为，“精神病的帽子能随便这么乱扣吗？那网吧岂不成了疯人院？”有网友自嘲地说：“我现在才知道，原来我是精神病啊。”“网瘾是精神病的话，那他们抢劫杀人不是都没有罪了？”网友“无知”的留言代表了不少人的观点。这个医学上的争论突然和司法问题联系在一起。在人们的印象中，精神病人犯罪可以不负法律责任，那么网络成瘾被纳入了精神病范畴，是不是意味着网络成瘾患者也不用对自己的行为承担法律责任呢？社会的质疑在现实中马上得到印证。11月10日下午，一份精神鉴定申请寄往四川省高级法院，《网络成瘾诊断标准》的第一次适用居然是以司法审判的方式出现的。21岁的四川射洪县青年胡安戈沉迷网络游戏。去年3月，他自称要做水产生意，让父母出资赞助。父亲给了他5万元钱，可胡安戈却将这些钱全用来买游戏装备。无颜面对父母的胡安戈突然有了一个荒唐的想法：“我辜负了父母的期望，不如结束他们的生命，让他们彻底解脱。”去年7月14日，他买了20包毒鼠强，放在家中的剩菜里。为了制造不在场的证据，他开车离开了家。父亲吃了掺有毒药的饭菜后中毒，所幸抢救及时，脱离了危险。	胡安戈,陶然,陶宏开	负向	"Beijing Evening News: On November 8, the first ""Diagnosis Standard for Internet Addiction"" in China was passed by experts. It will be promoted and used in the spirit departments of major hospitals across the country, especially in the top three hospitals, after being approved by the Ministry of Health of the General Logistics Department of the PLA to the Ministry of Health of the state. The standard divides Internet addiction into five categories: online game addiction, online sex addiction, online relational addiction, online information addiction and online trading addiction. Internet addiction is included in the category of mental diseases. According to the description of the ""Diagnostic Criteria"", the most intuitive quantification criterion for Internet addiction is that the average daily continuous network use time reaches or exceeds 6 hours, and the symptom criteria have reached or exceeded 3 months. Other criteria include strong desire or impulse for the Internet; When reducing or stopping the Internet, there will be withdrawal reactions such as malaise, irritability, irritability, inattention, sleep disorders, etc; Such as reducing or giving up other interests, entertainment or social activities due to the use of the Internet. Tao Ran, director of the Department of Medical Addiction of the General Hospital of Beijing Military Region, who is responsible for this subject, said that this standard was the conclusion of their four years' study of more than 3000 people. If the standard is finally confirmed, our country will be the first country in the world to list Internet addiction as a mental disease. Professor Tao Hongkai, the first person in China to quit Internet addiction, publicly opposed the Diagnostic Criteria. Based on his study of more than 5000 cases, Tao Hongkai said: ""Internet addiction is not a disease, let alone a crime. I firmly oppose treating Internet addicted teenagers as mental patients and labeling children with Internet addiction as ""mental illness"". "" Among netizens, supporters believe that ""Internet addiction is defined as a disease, which only means that we will consider the behavioral disorders caused by the Internet in a more professional, formal and comprehensive way in the future, and have more scientific methods to prevent and control the negative consequences caused by the Internet."" However, opponents believe that ""Can the hat of mental illness be so chaotic? Isn't the Internet cafe a lunatic asylum?"" Some netizens mock themselves: ""Now I know, I'm crazy."" ""If Internet addiction is a mental illness, then they are not guilty of robbery and murder?"" The留言of netizen ""Ignorance"" represents the views of many people. The medical controversy suddenly became connected with judicial problems. In people's impression, the mentally ill can escape legal responsibility for their crimes. Now that Internet addiction has been included in the category of mental diseases, does it mean that people with Internet addiction do not have to bear legal responsibility for their behavior? The social doubt was immediately confirmed in reality. On the afternoon of November 10, an application for mental identification was sent to the Sichuan Provincial High Court, and the first application of the ""Internet Addiction Diagnosis Standard"" was actually in the form of a judicial trial. Hu Ange, a 21 year old young man from Shehong County, Sichuan Province, is addicted to online games. Last March, he claimed that he wanted to do aquatic products business and asked his parents to sponsor him. His father gave him 50000 yuan, but Hu Ange used the money to buy game equipment. Hu Ange, who had no face to face with his parents, suddenly had an absurd idea: ""I have failed my parents' expectations. It is better to end their lives and let them completely解脱."" On July 14 last year, he bought 20 packets of rat poison and put them in the leftover food at home. In order to create evidence of absence, he drove away from home. Father Hu was poisoned after eating the food with poison. Fortunately, he was rescued in time and escaped from danger."

梁文博成丁俊晖后中国男二号他好比未经雕琢的钻石新浪体育讯　2009年威尔士公开赛资格赛最后一轮，梁文博将与本土选手戴尔争夺一个正赛席位。在开赛之前，我们对梁文博进行一番全方面的实力评估。中国选手梁文博出生于1987年，年仅21岁的他去年年终世界排名第40位，临时排名第21位。他大胆进攻的打球风格使他赢得了勇敢无畏的这样的评价，而在世锦赛中因为搞错主持人意思提前出场的他也被媒体冠了一个外号“是去是留”。梁文博在职业赛最好的成绩是08年世锦赛的八强，这也是中国内地选手在世锦赛的最好成绩。2006年多哈亚运会，代表中国参赛的他获得了个人项目的亚军以及团体冠军，同时他也是2005年IBSF21岁锦标赛的冠军。总体评价：梁文博确立中国男二号地位默默无闻的梁文博在08年世锦赛一路过关斩将闯入八强令世人惊叹，而他强势的进攻风格也赢得谢菲尔德球迷的青睐。他首轮击败了前世界冠军达赫迪，随后决胜局险胜经验丰富的老将斯威尔，在与最终的冠军奥沙利文的对决中，梁文博也给对手造成了不小的麻烦。在赛季首个排名赛北爱尔兰的比赛中，梁文博5-0横扫前世界冠军艾伯顿闯入16强。在本赛季巴林锦标赛资格赛5-1战胜古尔德的比赛中，梁文博轰出了职业生涯的第一个147分，并且打出139分以及115分两个高分杆将对手淘汰出局。如今，梁文博已经成为中国军团排在丁俊晖之后的第二号人物。实力分析：有能力闯入前16成为明星级球员梁文博有着令人惊叹的远台进攻能力，他击球的速度以及毁灭性也令人称道。他在比赛中所表现出来淡定的态度也证明他可以处理好自己身上的压力，而他的幽默感也使得观众对这个来自东方的少年颇为喜爱。用英国媒体的话来说，如果梁文博能够闯入前16名，他完全可以成为一个明星级的球员。弱点分析：打法激进恐成其软肋在某种程度上，他激进的打法同样是他的软肋所在。梁文博无畏的进攻打法很有可能给他带来难以收拾的局面，希金斯就曾经指出，如果梁文博的球风总是这么开放，那么他在面对顶尖球手的时候是很难获得胜利的。因此，在进攻时机的选择上多加斟酌对梁文博有益无害，其次，安全球质量的提高对于他来讲也是当务之急。前景分析：天赋毋庸置疑仍需脚踏实地梁文博好比一颗未曾雕琢的钻石，毫无疑问他是一名很有天赋的选手，但是他一定要踏踏实实的做一名比赛型的选手而不是昙花一现的球员。巴林锦标赛就是一个很好的例子，在打出满分杆横扫古尔德之后，梁文博随后2-5输给了乔治。老一辈球员总告诫年轻球员要戒骄戒躁，对于梁文博来讲也是一样。经过大赛的磨炼以及自身的努力，梁文博今后会有闪光的一天。作为一名刚刚跨入职业赛的年轻选手来说，梁文博的前途一片大好，但是如何在群雄并起的年代闯出属于自己的一片天地，梁文博要学习的还有很多。临近赛季末，威尔士公开赛对于他来讲是个抢分绝佳的时机。(Matt)	丁俊晖,达赫迪,艾伯顿,奥沙利文,古尔德,戴尔,希金斯,斯威尔,梁文博	正向	"Liang Wenbo became the second number one in China after Ding Junhui.

In the 5-1 victory over Gould in the Bahrain Championship qualification match of this season, Liang Wenbo scored the first 147 points of his career, and he scored 139 points and 115 points to eliminate his opponent. Now, Liang Wenbo has become the second most important figure of the Chinese army after Ding Junhui. Strength analysis:有能力to break into the top 16 and become a star player, Liang Wenbo has amazing long-term offensive ability, and his speed and destructiveness are also praiseworthy. His calm attitude in the game also proves that he can handle the pressure on himself, and his sense of humor also makes the audience love this teenager from the East very much. In the words of the British media, if Liang Wenbo can break into the top 16, he can completely become a star player. Weakness analysis: Radical play may be his weakness. To some extent, his radical play is also his weakness. Liang Wenbo's fearless attacking style is likely to bring him an uncontrollable situation. Higgins once pointed out that if Liang Wenbo's playing style is always so open, it will be difficult for him to win when facing top players. Therefore, it is beneficial for Liang Wenbo to choose the opportunity to attack carefully. Secondly, the improvement of the quality of safety balls is also an urgent task for him. Prospect analysis: There is no doubt that talent still needs to be down-to-earth. Liang Wenbo is like an unpolished diamond. There is no doubt that he is a very talented player, but he must be a game player instead of a fleeting player. The Bahrain Championship is a good example. After scoring a full score and sweeping Gould, Liang Wenbo lost 2-5 to George. The old players always warn the young players to guard against pride and impetuousness, which is the same for Liang Wenbo. After being tempered by the competition and his own efforts, Liang Wenbo will have a promising future. As a young player who has just entered the professional game, Liang Wenbo has a bright future. However, how to make his own way in the era of rising warlords, Liang Wenbo still has a lot to learn. At the end of the season, the Welsh Open is a great opportunity for him to grab points. (Matt)"

瑞银大幅调降金银现货31个月目标价瑞银宣布，将黄金现货3个月平均目标价下调7.1%，至1950美元/盎司，将1个月平均目标价下调9%，至1775美元。与此同时，将白银现货3个月平均目标价下调30%，至35美元/盎司，将1个月平均目标价下调30.4%，至32美元。瑞银在研究报告中指出：“我们看好黄金的基本立场没有改变，投机仓位较轻对金价是一个重大有利因素。但是，鉴于近来贵金属市场动势萎缩，我们早先设定的未来1个月和3个月目标价显得过于激进。”瑞银还称，未来几个月中，鉴于自己预计黄金的表现将更好，金/银价比率将进一步走升。(严郑/编译)本文系译者授权新浪财经独家使用，任何媒体未经授权均不得转载。若需授权必须经新浪财经与译者本人取得联系并获得书面认可。如果私自转载本文，译者保留一切追诉的权力，直至追究私自转载者的法律责任。	严郑	正向	"UBS sharply cut the 31-month target price of gold and silver spot.

河南女工被冒名顶替上班10年行政机关帮助造假本报通讯员曾庆朝梅安生江维本报记者　邓红阳公民的姓名权是宪法和法律赋予每个公民的特定的人身权利，非依法定程序，任何人不得冒名顶替、篡改和使用。然而，在河南省南阳市，一名女工的姓名不仅被人冒名顶替，而且在此过程中，县教委有关人员帮助冒名顶替者伪造假档案、公安局户籍警帮助篡改姓名，使一个假身份女工，冒名顶替上班10年，变成了一名人民教师。由此，引发了一场全国罕见的侵害姓名权案。近日，此案在南阳市中级人民法院审结。冒名顶替者王爱珍、串通换档案的方城县教育体育局、篡改户籍的南阳市某区公安分局被判败诉，并向女青年尚玉冉赔礼道谦，赔偿精神抚慰金4万元。有法律专家告诉《法制日报》记者，此案中，赔偿是次要的，更重要的是相关造假者已构成徇私舞弊罪、伪造公文罪。身份信息被冒名顶替十年尚玉冉于1975年8月5日出生于南阳市方城县古庄店乡，1993年9月7日由古庄店乡迁到南阳市新华街。2007年12月17日申领居民身份证。女青年王爱珍，1971年2月30日出生于方城县杨楼乡房山村。1993年夏天，经史福长的介绍，王爱珍通过尚玉冉之父尚国富的身份关系，以尚玉冉之名报考南阳师专实用人才培训班，1995年毕业，毕业证及档案上的名字仍为“尚玉冉”，在曾用名一栏中注明为王爱珍。1997年方城县政府决定招1995年南阳师专实用人才毕业生进入教育系统工作，其中就有“尚玉冉”。1998年4月7日，方城县人劳局调“尚玉冉”等13人到教育系统上班。1998年9月4日，方城县教委分配“尚玉冉”等5人到小史店乡教办室工作，“尚玉冉”被分配到小史店第二初级中学任教，2007年9月“尚玉冉”调入小史店镇第一初级中学任教。而真正的尚玉冉则于1994年被南阳某印刷厂招为全民合同制工人，该厂自1997年开始，生产陷入停产状态，2008年6月27日申请破产，2009年8月10日被宣告破产。据法官介绍，在已称为“尚玉冉”的王爱珍被调入教育系统工作的过程中，王爱珍借用了尚玉冉的招工档案。1998年3月26日，方城县人劳局向方城县经贸委发出通知，调“尚玉冉”到教委工作。1998年3月28日，方城县印刷厂将“尚玉冉”的介绍信通知给县经贸委，1998年4月，方城县人劳局通知方城县教委为“尚玉然”办理劳动手续。2006年9月16日，王爱珍办理了姓名及身份证信息为“尚玉冉”，头像为王爱珍的二代身份证。2007年11月25日，王爱珍又办理了姓名为“尚玉然”，人口基本信息及头像为王爱珍的二代身份证。2007年11月份，真正的尚玉冉持户口本到辖区派出所办理二代身份证，但经户籍民警查证，尚玉冉身份证已办出。尚玉冉发现自己的身份证信息被王爱珍冒用后，即向有关部门举报。随后，方城县有关部门责令方城县人劳局、方城县印刷厂、方城县经贸委、方城县教体局及某公安分局对此事写出书面答复。2008年4月25日，方城县人劳局取消王爱珍的职工身份，尚玉冉仍属印刷厂。2008年8月26日，公安机关作出决定，撤销了“尚玉然”的户口。2008年9月5日，王爱珍取得临时身份证，姓名仍为王爱珍(同目前王爱珍的身份证号)。2008年10月9日，方城县教体局决定取消王爱珍顶替他人所取得的有关证书和证件。受害者起诉讨要姓名权2009年5月21日，尚玉冉以侵害姓名权为由将王爱珍诉至方城县人民法院，要求判令王爱珍、区公安分局、方城县教育体育局、方城县小史店镇第一初级中学立即停止侵权，向原告赔礼道歉，并连带赔偿原告工资损失79338元，交通费662元，精神损害7万元，共计15万元。据查，尚玉冉为高中毕业，未参加南阳师范专科学校的学习，无教师资格证；目前，尚玉冉名单在印刷厂破产后的工人名单中。2010年7月1日，方城县人民法院经审理后认为：王爱珍冒名尚玉冉的事实存在，其行为违反了法律的强行性规定，构成了对尚玉冉姓名权的侵权，在王爱珍招工录用的过程中，王爱珍使用尚玉冉的招工档案，亦构成了对尚玉冉的侵权。但因印刷厂自1997年起生产处于停滞状态，从事实上说，王爱珍的侵权并未对尚玉冉造成实质损害后果。王爱珍在办理二代证的过程中，有意涂改“然”为“冉”，主观上存在故意，也构成对尚玉冉姓名权的侵害，虽造成了尚玉冉2007年11月份不能办证的后果，但得到公安机关的及时纠正，并未给尚玉冉造成实质上的损害。因此，王爱珍侵害尚玉冉姓名权事实成立，但尚玉冉未参加教育系统工作，且自2005年起已以印刷厂下岗职工的身份享受了社会低保，因此，尚玉冉要求王爱珍赔偿其工资79338元的请求，法院不予支持，王爱珍侵犯尚玉冉的姓名权，对尚玉冉的精神造成了一定的伤害，酌定赔偿精神损害抚慰金10000元，并向尚玉冉赔礼道歉。方城县教体局在办理招生及招工的过程中审查不严，存在严重过错，在客观上同王爱珍共同实施了侵害尚玉冉姓名权的行为，依法应承担民事责任，酌定方城县教体局向尚玉冉赔偿精神损害抚慰金20000元，并赔礼道歉。南阳某公安分局在办证的过程中出现错误，但事后立即收缴并进行了更正，未造成事实上的损害，因此公安局不应承担责任。王爱珍分配到小史店二初中工作并非现在的一初中，因此小史店一初中不应承担责任。此外，尚玉冉要求王爱珍赔偿其信访路费662元，法院不予支持。尚玉冉诉求令王爱珍立即停止侵权，因公安分局已注销了“尚玉然”及头像为王爱珍、人口基本信息为尚玉冉的身份证，且方城县人劳局已注销了王爱珍冒名尚玉冉在方城县教体局的职工身份，方城县教体局也注销了王爱珍冒名尚玉冉的相关资格证书，且尚玉冉的工作关系也已被恢复到印刷厂，因此，其诉求已经得到了实际解决。二审获赔4万元精神损失费一审判决下发后，尚玉冉认为王爱珍不但侵犯了她的姓名权，也侵犯了劳动就业权，造成她十几年没有工作，无法获得报酬。在王爱珍侵权的过程中，某公安分局、教体局、一初中帮助出谋划策，共同完成侵权行为，构成共同侵权，公安分局、小史店镇一初中亦应承担民事连带赔偿其各项损失共计15万元。为此，尚玉冉提出上诉。“我使用尚玉冉姓名参加师专的实用人才培训班，是尚玉冉父亲默许并亲自操作的，没有盗用及恶意冒名的故意，不应承担赔偿精神抚慰金责任，尚玉冉在印刷厂工作在先，我进入教育系统工作在后，两人的劳动就业权利未受影响，而且由于尚玉冉起诉我，使我失去了工作，现无赔偿能力。”由此，王爱珍同时也提起上诉。方城县教体局则以“主观上没有过错，不应承担赔偿和连带责任”为由，也提起上诉。12月3日，南阳市中级人民法院二审公开审理后认为：王爱珍以尚玉冉之名报考南阳师专实用人才培训班，此后又利用尚玉冉的招工档案，获取了全民合同制教师资格，从事教育活动。王爱珍虽声称给尚玉冉之父尚国富说过并知晓，但不能认定尚玉冉本人同意使用尚玉冉姓名，侵犯了尚玉冉享有的姓名使用权，对此应承担主要过错责任；南阳某公安分局为王爱珍办理了“尚玉然”的身份证存在审查不严过错，客观上给王爱珍创造了条件，也构成了对尚玉冉的姓名侵权，应承担相应民事责任。方城县教委在招录人员时未严格按照条件审查相应的证件手续，导致王爱珍冒用尚玉冉姓名获取招生资格，日后又为其办理了调动手续，亦存在明显的过错行为，应对此承担相应责任。小史店一初中作为接收单位，主观上不存在过错，亦没有审查王爱珍冒用尚玉冉姓名的法定职责，没有侵犯尚玉冉姓名的故意和过失，对此不承担民事责任。基于以上责任认定，法院判决王爱珍向尚玉冉口头赔礼道歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金20000元。南阳市某公安分局向尚玉冉口头赔礼道歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金10000元。方城县教体局向尚玉冉口头赔礼道歉并赔偿精神损害抚慰金10000元。案外人语依法行政是我国依法治国战略对每个行政机关的根本要求。依照相关条例和2009年7月12日中央发布实施的《关于实行党政领导干部问责的暂行规定》的相关规定，当地纪检监察部门、组织部门，按照干部管理权限应对相关人作出免职、引咎辞职、责令辞职的行政问责，作出组织处理，以警示后人，杜绝类似事件发生。同时，单位承担民事责任外，案中相关人员已构成刑法中规定的徇私舞弊罪，也应依法追究刑事责任。	史福长,尚国富,王爱珍,尚玉冉,邓红阳,曾庆朝梅安生江维	负向	"A female worker in Henan Province was substituted for 10 years. The administrative department helped to create fake news. Our newspaper communication correspondent Zeng Qing Chaomai Ansheng Jiang Wei Our newspaper reporter Deng Hongyang The name right of citizens is a specific personal right given to each citizen by the constitution and the law. Without the legal procedure, no one shall be allowed to take the name of another person, alter or use it. However, in Nanyang City, Henan Province, a female worker's name was not only taken in her name, but also in the process, the relevant personnel of the County Education Commission helped the fake archive to be taken in her name, and the public security bureau's household registration police helped to change her name, so that a female worker with a false identity took her name to work for 10 years, and became a people's teacher. As a result, a rare national case of infringing the right of name emerged. Recently, this case was heard and concluded by the Intermediate People's Court of Nanyang City. Wang Aizhen, who took the name of others, and the Fangcheng Education and Sports Bureau, which connived with the change of archives, and the Public Security Branch of a certain district in Nanyang, which tampered with the household registration, were sentenced to lose the case, and they apologized to the young woman Shang Yuran and compensated her with 40000 yuan for mental comfort. A legal expert told the reporter of the Legal Daily that in this case, the compensation was secondary, and more importantly, the relevant falsifiers had committed the crimes of malfeasance and falsifying public documents. Shang Yuran, whose identity information was taken in her name for ten years, was born in Guy Zhuangdian Township, Fangcheng County, Nanyang City on August 5, 1975, and moved to Xinhua Street, Nanyang City from Guy Zhuangdian Township on September 7, 1993. On December 17, 2007, he applied for a resident identity card. The young woman Wang Aizhen was born in Fangshan Village, Yanglou Township, Fangcheng County on February 30, 1971. In the summer of 1993, through the introduction of Shi Fuchang, Wang Aizhen, through the identity relationship of Shang Yuran's father Shang Guofu, applied for the training course of practical talents of Nanyang Normal College in the name of Shang Yuran, graduated in 1995, and the name on his graduation certificate and file was still ""Shang Yuran"", which was marked as Wang Aizhen in the column of his former name. In 1997, the Fangcheng County Government decided to recruit graduates of Nanyang Normal College of Practical Talents in 1995 to work in the education system, including ""Shang Yuran"". On April 7, 1998, the People's Labor Bureau of Fangcheng County transferred 13 people, including ""Shang Yuru"", to the education system to work. On September 4, 1998, the Education Commission of Fangcheng County assigned five people, including ""Shang Yurun"", to the teaching office of Xiaoshid store town. ""Shang Yurun"" was assigned to teach in the second junior middle school of Xiaoshid store. In September 2007, ""Shang Yurun"" was transferred to teach in the first junior middle school of Xiaoshid store town. However, the real Shang Yuran was recruited by a printing factory in Nanyang in 1994 as a worker under the contract of all people. Since 1997, the factory has been in a state of production suspension. On June 27, 2008, it applied for bankruptcy and was declared bankrupt on August 10, 2009. According to the judge, in the process of transferring Wang Aizhen, who has been called ""Shang Yuran"", to work in the education system, Wang Aizhen borrowed Shang Yuran's recruitment file. On March 26, 1998, the People's Labor Bureau of Fangcheng County issued a notice to the County Trade and Economic Commission to transfer ""Shang Yuran"" to the Education Commission for work. On March 28, 1998, the Fangcheng County Printing Factory notified the County Trade and Economic Commission of ""Shang Yuran""Introduction letter. In April 1998, the People's Labor Bureau of Fangcheng County notified the Education Commission of Fangcheng County to arrange labor procedures for ""Shang Yuran"". On September 16, 2006, Wang Aizhen applied for the second generation ID card with the name and ID card information of ""Shang Yuran"" and the portrait of Wang Aizhen. On November 25, 2007, Wang Aizhen applied for the second generation ID card with the name of ""Shang Yuran"", the basic population information and the portrait of Wang Aizhen. In November 2007, the real Shang Yuran took his household registration book to the police station in the jurisdiction to apply for the second generation ID card. However, after verification by the household registration officer, Shang Yuran has got his ID card. After Shang Yuran found that his ID card information was misused by Wang Aizhen, he immediately reported it to the relevant departments. Later, the relevant departments of Fangcheng County ordered the People's Labor Bureau of Fangcheng County, the Printing Factory of Fangcheng County, the Trade and Economic Commission of Fangcheng County, the Education and Sports Bureau of Fangcheng County and a public security branch to write a written reply on this matter. On April 25, 2008, the People's Labor Bureau of Fangcheng County cancelled Wang Aizhen's employee status, and Shang Yuran still belonged to the printing factory. On August 26, 2008, the public security organ made a decision to cancel the household registration of ""Shang Yuran"". On September 5, 2008, Wang Aizhen obtained a temporary identity card, which was still Wang Aizhen (the same as Wang Aizhen's ID number at present). On October 9, 2008, the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau decided to cancel the certificates and documents obtained by Wang Aizhen in place of others. The victim sued for his right of name. On May 21, 2009, Shang Yuran sued Wang Aizhen in the Fangcheng County People's Court for infringing his right of name, and asked the court to order Wang Aizhen, the district public security bureau, the Fangcheng County Education and Sports Bureau, and the No. 1 Junior Middle School of Xiaoshid Store Town, Fangcheng County, to immediately stop infringing his rights, apologize to the plaintiff, and pay 79338 yuan, 662 yuan, 70000 yuan for wage loss, traffic expenses, and 70000 yuan for mental damage, totaling 150000 yuan. According to the investigation, Shang Yuran graduated from high school, did not attend the study of Nanyang Normal College, and had no teacher qualification certificate; At present, Sh"

渤海证券：政策刺激带来结构性机会证券通周边市场的大幅反弹为国内市场的继续上涨提供了良好的外部环境，截止上周五，上证综指收于2374.44点，上涨93.35点，涨幅达4.09%；而深证成指则收于8994.15点，上涨346.64点，涨幅达4.01%。指数上涨的同时两市成交量继续放大，全周共成交11106.4亿元，较前一周放大近三成。就本周市场走势来看，由于权重板块银行股的启动，确实为市场向上的突破增加了动力与信心，再加上目前市场热点轮动较为顺畅，预计本周股指突破前高2402点的可能性较大。但特别需要注意的是，此波股指的反弹虽然量能随着上涨出现放大，但创新高时量能也应创出新高，特别是在银行、地产等权重板块发力的情况下，量能更应明显放大，否则不排除为诱多行情的可能。市场热点方面，随着消息面的变化，银行、新上海、太阳能、钢铁等板块明显受到场外资金的关注，而有色金属板块上周更是放量大幅震荡。我们坚持对金融危机下世界需求严重萎缩与前期涨幅巨大的有色金属保持高度警惕的观点，而短线看好兼具世博会、国际金融中心、国际航运中心等多种利好预期的新上海板块。		正向	Bohai Securities: policy stimulation brings structural opportunities. The sharp rebound of the surrounding market provides a good external environment for the continued rise of the domestic market. As of last Friday, the Shanghai Composite Index closed at 2374.44, up 93.35, or 4.09%; The Shenzhen Composite Index closed at 8994.15, up 346.64, or 4.01%. While the index rose, the trading volume of the two cities continued to expand, with a total trading volume of 1110.64 billion yuan for the whole week, nearly 30% higher than the previous week. In terms of the market trend this week, due to the launch of the weighted banking sector, it really adds momentum and confidence to the market's upward breakthrough. In addition, the current market hot spot rotation is relatively smooth, so it is expected that the stock index will have a greater possibility of breaking the previous high of 2402 this week. But it is worth noting that although the rebound of this wave of stock indexes has increased with the increase, the energy should also reach a new high when it hits a new high, especially in the case of the weighted sectors such as banking, real estate, etc., the energy should be significantly increased, otherwise, it is not ruled out that there may be an induced multi market. In terms of market hot spots, with the change of the news, the banking, new Shanghai, solar energy, steel and other sectors have obviously received the attention of off-site funds, while the nonferrous metal sector last week released a large volume of shocks. We insisted on being highly vigilant about the serious shrinkage of world demand under the financial crisis and the huge increase in nonferrous metals in the earlier period, and we were optimistic about the new Shanghai sector, which has a variety of favorable expectations such as the World Expo, the international financial center and the international shipping center, in the short term.

乔治克鲁尼受够被逼婚扬言不再出席记者会新浪娱乐讯北京时间2010年1月1日消息，据台湾媒体报道，好莱坞男星乔治-克鲁尼受够了每次受访都得回答一些记者提出“何时要结婚？”之类的蠢问题，决定新年开始不再参加记者会，只接受少数经过滤后的访问。爱搞笑的乔治-克鲁尼虽然常以幽默耍宝的方式面对媒体提问，但经常被问些他不愿回答的无聊事，他受不了。日前他在接受权威的《娱乐周刊》访问时表示：当你在事业上已具有一席之地，别人也知道你是谁，这就够了，“我不想变得更有名。更何况电影卖座往往是靠影片本身，与我没什么关系。”他坚持不再出席电影记者会，就连最近推出的新片《直上云霄》都把宣传受访的工作交给其他演员。不过乔治-克鲁尼并未因此自绝于观众，他笑着说，“我还是会参加红地毯活动，但记者会就谢谢啦。我只把重点放在少数聪明的访问，让每个能够访问到我的人都觉得很难得。”或许因为推掉不少宣传记者会，乔治-克鲁尼在最近和女友伊莉莎贝塔-卡娜丽斯(ElisabettaCanalis)及朋友们在墨西哥度年假，享受轻松的热带假期。(俐俐/文)	伊莉莎贝塔-卡娜丽斯,乔治克鲁尼,俐俐,ElisabettaCanalis,乔治	正向	"George Clooney is fed up with being forced to get married and threatens not to attend press conferences.

According to Taiwan media reports, Hollywood actor George Clooney is tired of having to answer some silly questions such as ""When to get married?"" asked by journalists every time he is interviewed. He decided not to attend press conferences at the beginning of the new year, but only to accept a few filtered interviews. George Clooney, who loves to joke, often faces media questions in a humorous way, but he can't stand being asked some boring questions that he is unwilling to answer. Recently, when he was interviewed by the authoritative ""Entertainment Weekly"", he said: When you have a place in your career and others know who you are, it is enough. ""I don't want to be more famous. Moreover, the success of a film often depends on the film itself, which has nothing to do with me."" He insisted on not attending the film press conference, and even handed over the publicity and interview work to other actors for the new film ""Straight to the Sky"" recently launched. However, George Clooney did not cut himself off from the audience. He said with a smile, ""I will still attend the red carpet activities, but thank you for the press conference. I only focus on a few smart visits, so that everyone who can visit me feels very rare."" Perhaps because he has rejected a lot of publicity press conferences, George Clooney recently spent his New Year's holiday with his girlfriend Elisabetta Canalis and his friends in Mexico to enjoy a relaxing tropical holiday.

Many fashionable young consumers are extremely enthusiastic about this new consumption mode. At present, a ""group buying tide"" is gradually rising in online shopping, and more and more consumers hope to join the online group buying and enjoy the benefits of ""wholesale price"". Although group buying has not become the mainstream consumption model, its explosive power has gradually become apparent. As a progressive enterprise, this information cannot be ignored. With the further popularity of the network, network group buying will be more common, the market will continue to expand, and the prospects are limitless. If you want to expand the market share, you can't take the channel of online group buying lightly! Today, there are many successful cases of online group buying, which is still going on in a big way. It can be said that the development momentum is good. Carefully analyzing group buying, the online shopping model mainly used by merchants now is mainly to gather scattered consumers with the same purchase intention through the Internet platform, and then purchase in large quantities from the manufacturer. Its core advantage lies in the more preferential commodity price. The price is more favorable, and the profit naturally decreases, which is the main reason why many manufacturers and merchants are unwilling to participate in online group buying! For this problem, the window and door enterprises have given a good answer! The success or failure of group buying is inextricably linked with the preparation of merchants in the early stage, and the price strategy is the most important part of it! Group buying prices must be discounted, but how to discount them and how to attract consumers to purchase on the basis of keeping profits is a problem that businessmen should consider deeply. After all, businessmen are the first ones who have the initiative in the face of prices! Some agents also shared their successful experience in group buying, such as how to formulate clever and effective price strategies, how to create a group buying atmosphere, and so on. At the same time, the agents believe that group buying is the general trend. With people's growing dependence on the Internet, the first thing they think of is to surf the Internet when they want to buy something! On the other hand, group buying by merchants is also an effective way to attract people's attention, improve brand popularity and influence! The consumption mode of online group buying has become an irreversible trend. Manufacturers should follow and promote the development of this trend, seize the business opportunity and seek new breakthroughs!"
美就业刺激计划推涨大宗商品煤飞色舞机会再现记者彭浩编者按：百转千回，被喻为变相的第三次量化宽松(QE3)——美国4470亿美元的就业刺激方案最终出台。回顾前两轮宽松的货币政策不难发现，全球流动性过剩和投资需求增强是大宗商品价格上涨的主力。而与大宗商品走势密切联动的煤炭和有色板块，在刺激政策的提振下，A股市场“煤”飞“色”舞则是老戏码。美国刺激计划被喻为变相QE3百转千回，被喻为变相的第三次量化宽松(QE3)——美国大规模的就业刺激方案最终出台。美国总统奥巴马在本周四(北京时间)迫不及待地向外界透露了即将推出的4470亿美元刺激计划，远超出市场预期的3000亿美元。本周五(北京时间)，奥巴马会公布刺激计划的详细内容。但对于资本市场而言，投资人关心的并不是详细内容，而是关心这笔钱究竟从哪里来？这是一个变相的QE3吗？在美国时间周四，即北京时间周五晚上，不仅仅奥巴马会详细阐述这个刺激计划，美联储主席伯南克也会在当天发表讲话。听听伯南克怎么说，就知道这4470亿究竟是不是变相的QE3了。早在8月10日，美联储便指出，美国经济的增长率明显低于预期，预计未来经济的复苏将更为缓慢，就业增长将颇为疲软，目前美联储正在讨论其他的政策工具。外加奥巴马连番“预告”的经济刺激计划，这使人不得不推测，变相的QE3已经开始启动。国务院发展研究中心企业研究所副所长张文魁最近表示，美国和欧洲是通过凯恩斯主义的方法来拉动经济，以前是靠金融体系、靠央行、靠美联储来刺激，这样会导致美国的QE3或者是变相的QE3一定会推出的。资金重返大宗商品市场对于奥巴马出炉的就业刺激计划，市场的反应比较乐观。投资者纷纷重返股市和大宗商品市场，其中一些投资者选择卖出黄金等避险资产、买入高风险资产。美国时间9月7日，美国三大股指上涨，交投最活跃的12月黄金期货结算价跌幅3%。纽约石油近来已经有一个反弹，也是对于量化宽松的憧憬。所谓量化宽松，是指央行通过购买国债等中长期债券，增加基础货币供给。例如前两次量化宽松，都是美联储自己印钞票，然后买美国政府发行的国债，美国政府拿到钱后去刺激经济。其关键点在于，这个世界平白无故地多了很多的美元，美元泛滥将导致通胀。回顾前两轮宽松的货币政策，投资者可以发现，全球流动性过剩和投资需求增强是大宗商品价格上涨的主导力量。美国于2010年11月宣布实行规模为6000亿美元的第二轮量化宽松货币政策(QE2)。美联储在执行QE2过程中投放的大量流动性并没有完全进入实体经济，而是有很大一部分进入了国际大宗商品市场，特别是涌入资源性产品市场和部分农产品市场，从而推动价格上涨。而与大宗商品走势密切相关的煤炭和有色板块，在刺激政策的提振下，A股市场“煤”飞“色”舞则是老戏码。旺季来临煤炭“起飞”煤炭股去年9至10月曾?升，当时受到季节性、通胀预期、QE2、节能减排年底结束等因素所刺激。此时，煤炭股再次受到同样的季节性及美国就业刺激计划等因素的提振。中金公司9月6日发布煤炭行业研究报告，表示煤炭股季节性行情有望逐步启动，期待显著的相对收益。动力煤价格有望企稳反弹，原因是下游行业补库存需求和9、10月份通常是电厂冬季备煤时段。焦煤价格则随钢铁业步入旺季而有望小幅反弹。“由于欧债危机恶化、国内经济放缓和紧缩政策持续等原因，短期煤炭板块仍面临一定压力，但良好的盈利确定性和即将到来的季节性行情将使煤炭板块有望跑赢大盘。”中金公司指出，如果欧债问题取得进展或美国推出经济刺激计划，煤炭板块有望出现可观行情。在具体投资标的方面，中金公司推荐中国神华(601088)、兖州煤业(600188)、中煤能源(601898)、潞安环能(601699)和兰花科创(600123)。其实，目前煤炭板块估值已处于较低水平。统计数据显示，截至目前，申万煤炭开采板块的平均市盈率为15.42倍，自2000年以来的平均值为28.92倍；市净率为3.43倍，自2000年以来的平均值为4.78倍；预测市盈率方面，煤炭板块2011年、2012预测市盈率分别为13.87倍、11.72倍。有色随大宗商品“舞动”回顾去年，在美联储推出第二轮数量宽松政策后，资本市场更是开始了新一轮的大涨，尤其是大宗商品市场。放眼当下，投行摩根士丹利称，在周五和周六的G7财长和央行行长会议上，主要经济体可能联手采取一系列的救市行动。大摩预计，美、欧、日和英国央行可能在周末的会议上宣布联手放松货币政策，比如降息或是加大量化宽松。大摩的分析师表示，当前经济增长疲软以及资产价格持续大跌间形成的恶性循环，使得各国更有可能采取联合的货币政策干预行动。此前，有外媒引述知情人士的话报道称，各国可能在这次G7会议上维持刺激性的货币政策，并在允许的情况下，放慢一些国家的财政收紧步伐。对于股市而言，预期先行，也就是流动性可能在达到极致后迎来的放松边际，对持续受压制的有色板块当然是大利好。另外，美国即将推出的4470亿美元刺激计划为大宗商品市场走强注入强心针。此前，受累于美国评级下调，欧债危机爆发，有色商品价格下跌，导致国内的有色板块出现连续暴跌，不少品种短期跌幅超20%，在相关利好预期刺激下，从历史经验来看，跌幅较大的板块短期面临较大的反弹空间。近期磷矿资源类个股表现出色，有望重新激发市场对同属稀缺资源的有色板块的热情。重点公司云海金属(002182)云海金属董事长梅小明在9月7日的网上说明会上表示，公司年初至今接订单较去年同期有增长，明年公司计划铝镁合金销售规模进一步提高，并以效益为中心，通过多种方式量化成本控制。同时，云海金属董秘吴剑飞表示，目前公司暂无股权激励计划。公司将集中精力做好现有业务，暂无战略性并购重组的想法。对于未来经营情况，公司预计，2011年1-9月归属于上市公司股东的净利润比上年同期下降幅度小于50%。对于业绩变动的原因，公司称铝合金销售量增长不如预期，以及财务费用比较高。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流入2724万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流入2920万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流入2551万元。株冶集团(600961)“企业用电受到限制，但总产量却不降反增，这是创新发展方式的结果。”株冶集团负责人近期谈到，仅电力成本一项，今年前7个月，株冶集团就增加成本5000万元。在铅锌主产品盈利空间低的情况下，我们利用现有的优势，从冶炼废弃物中提高金、银等有价金属的回收率。今年1-8月份，株冶完成销售收入80多亿元，比去年同期增长8.5%，铅锌总产量39.5万吨，预计全年产量60万吨，全年销售收入达110亿元。记者发现，株冶集团增产却不增收，今年上半年还处于亏损状态。尽管业绩不尽人意，但前期连续调整的株冶集团表现有所回暖，该股本周涨幅已经接近10%。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流出302万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流入1096万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流出1069万元。兰花科创(600123)对于兰花科创亚美大宁矿可能在9月份启动复产的传闻，兰花科创证券部工作人员回应称，现在还处于换证阶段，具体进度还不好说，但年内复产肯定是没问题的。兰花科创方面表示，目前双方正在积极办理亚美大宁公司采矿权许可证、安全生产许可证和其他证照的换发，延期、年检、更新等工作，推动亚美大宁公司尽快复产。根据多家机构的预测，以兰花科创原有36%的持股比例计算，若山西亚美大宁近期恢复产能至200万吨，可为兰花科创贡献每股收益近0.4元；该矿目前可具备500至600万吨产能；若2012年产量达到500万吨，则全年可为公司贡献每股收益近1元。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流入263万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流出1754万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流出4338万元。昊华能源(601101)根据公告，京东方计划投资220亿元到内蒙古鄂尔多斯投资5.5代AM-OLED有机发光显示器件生产线，当地政府将配置呼吉尔特矿区巴彦淖井田总量不低于10亿吨储量的煤矿，京东方将向昊华能源转让能源项目的控股股权，与昊华能源共同开发该煤炭资源。昊华能源目前拥有储量约25亿吨(其中位于鄂尔多斯的高家梁和红庆梁煤矿储量合计21.8亿吨)，权益储量19亿吨。长江证券分析，该项投资完成后公司的权益储量新增至少27%。预计该煤矿的设计储量达到800万吨左右，2015年有望建成投产。该机构预计，2011年、2012年和2013年昊华能源的每股收益将分别为1.449元、1.727元和1.807元。资金流向：E投资金融终端显示，昨日主力资金净流出175万元，而最近5个交易日录得资金净流出1929万元，最近10个交易日录得资金净流出3496万元。《投资快报》发自广州	吴剑飞,彭浩,梅小明	正向	"The US employment stimulus package pushes up the opportunity of coal flying and color dancing again. Peng Hao, the editor in charge of the reporter, wrote: After a thousand turns, the US employment stimulus package, which is referred to as the disguised third quantitative easing (QE3) - the US employment stimulus package of 447 billion dollars finally came out. Looking back on the two rounds of loose monetary policy, it is not difficult to find that the main force behind the rise of commodity prices is the excess of global liquidity and the increase of investment demand. And the coal and nonferrous metal sectors, which are closely linked with the trend of commodities, are the old play in the A-share market under the boost of the stimulus policy. The US stimulus package is referred to as the disguised QE3, which has been referred to as the disguised third quantitative easing (QE3) - the massive employment stimulus package of the United States has finally come out. US President Obama could not wait to reveal the $447 billion stimulus package to be launched on Thursday (Beijing time), far exceeding the market expectation of $300 billion. On Friday (Beijing time), Obama will announce the details of the stimulus package. But for the capital market, what investors are concerned about is not the details, but where the money comes from? Is this a disguised QE3? On Thursday in the United States, that is, Friday night in Beijing, Obama will not only elaborate on the stimulus package, but also Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will give a speech on the same day. Listening to what Bernanke said, I know that this 447 billion is not a disguised QE3. As early as August 10, the Federal Reserve pointed out that the growth rate of the U.S. economy was significantly lower than expected, and it is expected that the future economic recovery will be slower and employment growth will be weak. At present, the Federal Reserve is discussing other policy tools. In addition, Obama's repeated ""preview"" of the economic stimulus plan, it is inevitable to speculate that the disguised QE3 has started. Zhang Wenge, deputy director of the Institute of Enterprise Development of the Development Research Center of the State Council, recently said that the United States and Europe are pulling the economy through Keynesian methods. In the past, the financial system, the central bank and the Federal Reserve were used to stimulate the economy, which will lead to the fact that the QE3 or the disguised QE3 of the United States must be launched. The return of funds to the commodity market In response to Obama's employment stimulus plan, the market responded optimistically. Investors have returned to the stock market and commodity markets, and some of them have chosen to sell safe haven assets such as gold and buy risky assets. On September 7, the three major stock indexes in the United States rose, and the most active December gold futures settlement price fell by 3%. New York oil has also rebounded recently, which is in anticipation of quantitative easing. Quantitative easing refers to the central bank's purchase of medium and long-term bonds such as treasury bonds to increase the supply of base money. For example, the previous two rounds of quantitative easing were that the Federal Reserve printed its own money and then bought the treasury bonds issued by the U.S. government. The U.S. government took the money to stimulate the economy. The key point is that there are a lot of dollars in the world for no reason, and the flooding of the dollar will lead to inflation. Looking back on the two rounds of loose monetary policy, investors can find that the main force behind the rise of commodity prices is the excess of global liquidity and the increase of investment demand. The United States announced in November 2010 that it would implement a second round of quantitative easing monetary policy (QE2) with a scale of 600 billion US dollars. A large amount of liquidity released by the Federal Reserve in the process of implementing QE2 did not fully enter the real economy, but a large part of it entered the international commodity market, especially the resource product market and some agricultural product markets, which pushed up prices. The coal and nonferrous metal sectors, which are closely related to the trend of commodities, have been a recurring play in the A-share market under the boost of the stimulus policy. The peak season is coming. Coal ""takes off"". Coal shares rose in September and October last year, stimulated by seasonal factors, inflation expectations, QE2, the end of energy saving and emission reduction at the end of the year and other factors. At this time, coal stocks were once again boosted by the same seasonality and other factors such as the US employment stimulus plan. China International Capital Corporation released a coal industry research report on September 6, saying that the seasonal trend of coal stocks is expected to gradually start, and we look forward to significant relative returns. Thermal coal prices are expected to stabilize and rebound, because the downstream industry needs to replenish inventories, and September and October are usually the time for power plants to prepare coal for winter. Coking coal prices are expected to rebound slightly as the steel industry enters the peak season. ""Due to the reasons such as the deterioration of the European debt crisis, the slowdown of the domestic economy and the continuation of the tightening policy, the coal sector still faces some pressure in the short term, but the good profit certainty and the coming seasonal trend will make the coal sector outperform the market."" CSIC pointed out that if progress is made in the European debt issue or the United States launches an economic stimulus plan, the coal sector is expected to have a considerable market trend. In terms of specific investment targets, CICC recommends China Shenhua (601088), Yanzhou Coal Industry (600188), China Coal Energy (601898), Lu'an Huaneng (601699) and Lanhuakexin (600123). In fact, the valuation of the coal sector has been at a low level at present. Statistics show that up to now, the average PE ratio of Shenwan Coal Mining Sector is 15.42 times, and the average value since 2000 is 28.92 times; The average PB ratio is 3.43 times, and the average value since 2000 is 4.78 times; In terms of expected P/E ratio, the expected P/E ratio of the coal sector in 2011 and 2012 was 13.87 times and 11.72 times respectively. Nonferrous metals ""dance"" with commodities Looking back on last year, after the Federal Reserve launched the second round of quantitative easing policy, the capital market started a new round of substantial growth, especially the commodity market. Focusing on the present, Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, said that at the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting on Friday and Saturday, major economies may join hands to take a series of rescue actions. Morgan Stanley expects that the central banks of the United States, Europe, Japan and the United Kingdom may announce joint easing of monetary policy at the weekend, such as interest rate cuts or quantitative easing. Morgan Stanley's analysts said that the vicious cycle formed between the current weak economic growth and the sustained sharp decline in asset prices makes it more likely for countries to take joint monetary policy intervention actions. Earlier, foreign media quoted insiders as saying that at this G7 meeting, countries may maintain stimulative monetary policies and, if allowed, slow down the fiscal tightening of some countries. For the stock market, expectations come first, that is, the marginal relaxation of liquidity that may reach the extreme is of great benefit to the有色sector that has been continuously suppressed. In addition, the $44.7 billion stimulus package to be launched by the United States in the near future injects a strong shot into the commodity market. Earlier, due to the downgrade of the United States, the outbreak of the European debt crisis and the decline of nonferrous commodity prices, the domestic nonferrous sector experienced a continuous slump, and many varieties fell more than 20% in the short term. Stimulated by relevant favorable expectations, from the perspective of historical experience, the sectors with large declines are facing a large rebound space in the short term."

iPhone收家中遭窃影像华裔工程师高科技擒贼据美国《星岛日报》报道，高科技工具的设计是帮助和方便使用者，圣荷西一名华裔居民就懂得利用手上的iPhone，在办公室遥控发现家中正被两名窃匪爆窃，报警将两窃匪拘捕。31岁圣荷西华裔居民PeterChen是一间高科公司的工程师，对高科技事物相当熟识，感恩节前在女朋友的汽车被人偷窃车内物品后，他以280元购买了一个Logitech700e监视摄影机，在自己圣荷西长青区的家中安装，以防家中亦被爆窃。他并将监视摄影机系统连接到他的iPhone中，而该系统正好在上周发挥作用。11月29日下午2时，当陈彼德在办公室工作时，他发现有电邮传到他的iPhone中，电邮是由他在家中安装的防盗监视摄影系统传来的，因为该系统开启后拍摄到家中有物体移动，即将拍摄到的照片电邮到他的iPhone,而发出警报。他在安装后亦曾收到该系统传来的照片，但发现移动的物体是家中的猫后，便将照片删除，但今次他发现照片是家中出现一名男子和一名青少年，他怀疑家中正被人爆窃，立即用iPhone打911报警。两名圣荷西交通警员SteevePayne警长和JeffreyFielder警员刚在陈家附近巡逻，接报后立即赶抵陈彼德的家，发现两名相信是窃匪的男子在屋内爆窃，将屋内的现金和电子游戏机放入袋中，即将两人拘捕。当陈彼德从办公室赶回家察看时，两警正将两窃匪送入警车。被捕两窃匪分别是26岁的GabrielHernandez和一名17岁的男孩，两人已被警方落案控以入屋爆窃罪名。圣荷西警方发言人RonnieLopez警长表示，该案正好显示警民合作的最好例子。事主利用高科技帮助警方拘捕爆窃匪徒。事主陈彼德则表示，“我当时亦十分紧张，因为过程有如电影情节，看见匪徒正在我的家中，但我又不能亲手拘捕他们，只有报警。”他说，“我花近3百元购买该防盗系统，现发现很值得。今后我会更小心查核iPhone收到该系统传来的照片，但考虑在家中安装更多的监视摄影机。”(张耀鋈)	张耀鋈,陈彼德,SteevePayne,JeffreyFielder,GabrielHernandez,RonnieLopez,PeterChen	正向	"The iPhone at home was stolen from the image of a Chinese engineer. The high-tech criminal catcher reported by the US ""Sing Tao Daily"" was designed to help and facilitate users. A Chinese resident in San Jose knew how to use his iPhone to remotely find that his house was being burgled by two thieves in his office and called the police to arrest them. Peter Chen, a 31 year old Chinese resident in San Jose, is an engineer of a high-tech company. He is quite familiar with high-tech things. After his girlfriend's car was stolen on Thanksgiving Day, he bought a Logitech 700e surveillance camera for 280 yuan and installed it in his home in the Evergreen District of San Jose to prevent his home from being burgled. He also connected the surveillance camera system to his iPhone, and the system happened to work last week. At 2 o'clock on November 29, when Chen Peter was working in the office, he found that an email was sent to his iPhone. The email was sent from the anti-theft surveillance camera system he installed at home, because the system took pictures of moving objects in the house after it was turned on, and then emailed the pictures to his iPhone to give an alarm. After installation, he also received photos from the system, but he deleted the photos when he found that the moving object was a cat at home. This time, however, he found that the photo was a man and a teenager who appeared at home, so he suspected that his home was being burgled and immediately called 911 with his iPhone. Steeve Payne, a police officer of San Jose Traffic Police, and Jeffrey Fielder, a police officer, were just patrolling near Chen's home. After receiving the report, they immediately arrived at Chen Peter's home and found that two men believed to be thieves were breaking into the house and putting cash and electronic games in the house into bags, and then arresting them. When Chen Peter hurried home from his office to have a look, the two police officers were just sending the two thieves to the police car. The two arrested thieves were Gabriel Hernandez, 26, and a 17 year old boy. Both of them have been prosecuted by the police for burglary. Ronnie Lopez, a spokesman for the San Jose Police Department, said that the case just showed the best example of police civilian cooperation. The victim used high technology to help the police arrest the burglars. Chen Peter, the victim, said, ""I was also very nervous at that time, because the process was like a movie plot. I saw the gangster in my home, but I could not arrest them by myself. I could only call the police."" He said, ""I spent nearly 300 yuan on the anti-theft system, and now I found it was worth it. In the future, I will be more careful to check the photos sent by the iPhone from the system, but I will consider installing more surveillance cameras at home."" (Zhang Yaoyi)"
约翰尼-德普新片探班“头破血流”幸无事(图)新浪娱乐讯北京时间2009年4月14日讯，波多黎各当地时间4月13日，约翰尼·德普(JohnnyDepp)在新片《莱姆酒日记》(TheRumDiary)拍摄现场。约翰尼·德普从一辆经典款菲亚特中钻出头来，他脸上有几处淤青，耳朵后面和头上有几处还留下血迹，庆幸的是只是剧中角色受了伤，德普本人没有事。据悉德普在片场粉丝巨多，热情的影迷总会走上来和他打招呼，人缘好他也十分亲切地回应，有时候是一路打招呼下来的，不过这也多少影响了拍摄进度。约翰尼·德普在《莱姆酒日记》中饰演上世纪50年代波多黎各一名终日酗酒的报纸记者保罗·坎普。图库供稿		正向	"Johnny Depp's new film, ""Head Broken Blood"", was lucky (picture) Sina Entertainment News On April 14, 2009, Beijing time, on April 13, Puerto Rican local time, Johnny Depp (JohnnyDepp) was at the shooting scene of the new film ""The Rum Diary"".

机构跑步出场午后延续调整姚茂敦昨夜，美股小幅收高。这让近期的死多头高兴不已，以为今天又是个大好日子。的确，A股早盘双双高开，但随后的几波跳水杀跌，表明忍耐多日的空方开始发威。其实，针对昨天的放量滞涨。笔者已经在收评《空方猛烈反击，强势调整将持续几日！》中有过分析，并认为：昨天的盘中调整其实并不充分，因此，这种调整可能还将持续几日。从早盘情况看，笔者的判断完全正确。从消息面看，今日好消息居多。其中，最重要的当然是：船舶工业振兴规划昨天如期出台，五大措施支持造船业；石化业规划昨天没上会，最快下周审议；证监会严把新股上市质量关，IPO近期难重启。但一条2月大小非日均减持4，33亿元，规模创一年来新高的利空消息，还是让市场感受了丝丝凉意。从机构资金流向看，本周连续3天跑步出场后，今日早盘机构继续出逃。根据统计，早盘沪市，机构资金净流出竟高达31亿左右。此举表明，经过一轮大幅反弹之后，机构对后市发展开始变得谨慎，并纷纷拉高出货，从而将风险留给拼命入场的中小投资者。从技术上看，目前，大盘多种技术指标已处于短期超买状态。特别是KDJ指标高位刚刚死叉向下，MACD红柱开始缩短，说明大盘的调整可能需要一定时间。不过，由于中短期均线勾头向上，底部不断抬高，已经对后市构成强大技术支撑。也就是说，经过必要的回调之后，大盘还有上攻动能。综上所述，尽管昨天沪指测试了2300点，并继续站在2245点之上，但从机构加速减仓来看，也表明大盘短期回调风险较大。再加上外围市场反复无常，也使得大盘必须要经过充分调整，消化掉部分获利盘和套牢盘之后，才有足够动能继续上攻。早盘，沪指跌破5日均线，量能萎缩，表明大盘将进入短期休整阶段。展望午后，继续震荡可能性比较大。	姚茂敦	正向	The institutional running out in the afternoon continued to adjust Yao Maodun last night. The U.S. stock market closed slightly higher. This has made the recent bears very happy, thinking that today is another good day. Indeed, A-shares opened high in the morning, but the subsequent diving and killing waves showed that the empty side that had been tolerated for many days began to exert its power. In fact, in response to yesterday's volume expansion and stagnation. The author has analyzed in the review《The strong adjustment of the empty side will last for several days! 》, and I think: yesterday's in-trading adjustment is actually insufficient, so this adjustment may continue for several days. Judging from the morning trading situation, the author's judgment is completely correct. From the perspective of news, today's good news is the most important. Of course, the most important thing is: the revitalization plan of the shipbuilding industry was issued as scheduled yesterday, and five measures were taken to support the shipbuilding industry; the petrochemical industry plan did not go to the conference yesterday, and it will be reviewed as soon as next week; the CSRC strictly controls the quality of new shares listing, and it is difficult to restart IPO in the near future. However, the bad news that the average daily reduction of non-tradable shares in February was 4.33 billion yuan, a record high in a year, still made the market feel a little cool. From the perspective of institutional fund flow, after three consecutive days of running out this week, institutions continued to escape this morning. According to statistics, the net outflow of institutional funds in the morning market in Shanghai was as high as 3.1 billion yuan. This move shows that after a huge rebound, institutions have become cautious about the future development and have begun to pull out and deliver goods at a high level, leaving risks to small and medium-sized investors who are desperately entering the market. Technically, at present, a variety of technical indicators of the market have been in a short-term overbought state. In particular, the KDJ index has just died and forked downward at a high level, and the MACD red column has begun to shorten, indicating that the market adjustment may need some time. However, since the medium short moving average hooks up and the bottom rises continuously, it has formed a strong technical support for the future. That is to say, after the necessary adjustment, the market still has the momentum to attack. In summary, although the Shanghai Stock Index tested 2300 points yesterday and continued to stand above 2245 points, the fact that institutions are accelerating their reduction of positions also shows that the market has a high risk of short-term adjustment. In addition, the repeated changes in the surrounding market also make it necessary for the market to undergo full adjustment and digest some profitable chips and trapped chips before it has enough kinetic energy to continue to attack. In the morning trading, the Shanghai Stock Index broke through the 5-day moving average, and the trading volume shrank, indicating that the market will enter a short-term consolidation stage. Looking forward to the afternoon, there is a great possibility of continued volatility.

Ma Yunpeng of ICBC International announced that CSCL's third quarter results were poor, with a net loss of 951 million yuan, compared with a net profit of 2.2 billion yuan in the same period last year. The unaudited net loss from January to September was about 1.6 billion yuan, exceeding our estimated annual loss of 1.2 billion yuan. We have respectively reduced the freight rates of American and European routes in 2011 by 20% and 13%, and after revising the profit forecast, we expect the net losses in 2011 and 2012 to be 2.7 billion yuan and 2.9 billion yuan respectively. CSCL's current valuation of 0.6 times the expected price earnings ratio in 2011 and 2012 is far lower than the past average level of 1.0 times. In view of the low valuation, we maintain the ""hold"" rating, with a target price of HK $1.95, equivalent to 0.7 times the expected price earnings ratio for 11 years. Disappointing performance in the third quarter. CSCL announced that its performance in the third quarter was poor, with a net loss of 951 million yuan, compared with a net profit of 2.2 billion yuan in the same period last year. We previously expected that the trade volume and freight rates in the third quarter peak season would fall year on year due to the weakness of the global trade environment, but CSCL's performance in the third quarter was worse than expected. The unaudited net loss from January to September was about 1.6 billion yuan, exceeding our estimated annual loss of 1.2 billion yuan. The total trade volume in the third quarter decreased by 0.1% year on year, of which the trade volume of American and European routes decreased by 25% and 0.3% respectively, and the income decreased by 47% and 45% respectively. The prospects are still uncertain. The average Shanghai Export Container Freight Rate Index (SCFI) in the third quarter fell by 2% in the first half of the year, of which the American and European routes fell by 23% and 7% respectively. We believe that the debt crisis solution reached at the European summit may stimulate the rise of freight rates in the short term. However, we believe that there is little chance of improvement in the fourth quarter performance and the outlook for next year will be worse due to the uncertainty of the global economic prospects, especially the trade volume and freight rates in Europe. CSCL ordered more new ships. The company ordered 12 new ships with a total container capacity of 1000 TEU, with a total investment of US $1.1 billion. Since the company has only 8 ships of the same type at present, we believe that the new ship will enhance the company's competitiveness in European and American routes. At the same time, we believe that the fierce competition in the European route has forced the company to order large ships, because only ships with a standard box capacity of 1000 can make money in the present weak market. Given that the price of new ships is still low at present, and the debt ratio of CSCL is about 40%, we believe that CSCL will not have liquidity problems in the short term. Valuation and rating. Due to the weakness of the shipping market in the first half of the year, we have respectively reduced the volume and average freight rate forecasts of American and European routes, and correspondingly reduced the 2011 profit forecast to a net loss of 2.7 billion yuan (previously 1.2 billion yuan). CSCL's current valuation is 0.6 times the expected price earnings ratio in 2011, far lower than the past average level of 1.0 times. We maintain the ""hold"" rating, with the target price adjusted from HK $2.1 to HK $1.95, equivalent to 0.7 times the expected price earnings ratio for 11 years, one standard deviation lower than the average level in the past, because we believe that the shipping market is in a declining cycle."

国泰君安：匹克业绩符合预期维持收集国泰君安国际彭港祥得益于销售同比增速达到24.7%，净利润增长22.1%至人民币4.23亿元（占市场和我们全年预测的42.5%和41.9%）。销售增速和2011年一二季度的25%和24%的订货会增速吻合。由于鞋类和服装类产品平均零售单价上涨，整体毛利率同比上涨了2.2个百分点到39.9%。销售和行政管理费用占销售比例从2010年上半年的15.1%增加到17.6%,主要是由于宣传推广费用、行政人员费用、研发费用的上升以及新增的城建税。公司上半年净增加395个零售网点，令公司的零售店铺数量达到为7,619家。公司2012年第一季度的订货会订单增长20.5%，仍然较快。2012开始的批发折扣调整有助于进一步改善公司的毛利率水平。我们维持公司2011-13年每股盈利预测分别为人民币0.482/0.573/0.679元。匹克目前的估值是6.9倍2011年预测市盈率。鉴于市场担忧体育用品行业的过度竞争和不明朗因素持续，我们维持收集评级但是下调目标价至4.70港元，对应2011年8倍预测市盈率。催化剂：订单增长强劲。风险：存货上升。欢迎发表评论我要评论	彭港祥	正向	Guotai Junan: Peak's performance meets expectations to maintain Guotai Junan International Peng Hongxiang, benefiting from the sales growth rate of 24.7% year on year, and the net profit increased by 22.1% to 423 million yuan (42.5% and 41.9% of the market and our annual forecast). The sales growth rate and the order growth rate of 25% and 24% in the first and second quarters of 2011 coincide. Due to the increase of the average retail unit price of footwear and clothing products, the overall gross profit margin rose 2.2 percentage points year on year to 39.9%. Sales and administration expenses increased from 15.1% in the first half of 2010 to 17.6%, mainly due to the increase of publicity and promotion expenses, administrative personnel expenses, research and development expenses and the new urban construction tax. The company's retail stores increased by 395 in the first half of the year, reaching 7619. The company's order growth for the first quarter of 2012 was 20.5%, still fast. The wholesale discount adjustment starting from 2012 will help further improve the company's gross margin level. We maintain the company's earnings forecast for 2011-13 at RMB 0.482/0.573/0.679 per share respectively. Peak's current valuation is 6.9 times the 2011 forecast earnings per share. In view of the fact that the excessive competition and uncertainty in the sports industry continue to worry the market, we maintain the rating of collection but cut the target price to HK $4.70, which corresponds to 8 times the forecast earnings per share in 2011. Catalyst: Strong order growth. Risk: Inventory rises. Welcome to comment I want to comment
反弹受阻3000点附近或再次蓄势德邦证券上周市场的走势基本验证我们上周的周策略报告，即市场短期反弹空间已经有限，难言系统性机会。从上周的走势看前三个交易日市场震荡小幅度上扬，不断趋近市场的关键技术阻力位，在周四达到重要的技术点位即3100点(沪指)时市场即出现明显压力，当天市场出现较大幅度回调，同时受到短期获利盘的抛压，导致当天市场放量大跌，成交量创了近期的天量，沪市成交量达1467亿元，深市也达到1157亿元。市场在关键技术点位受阻导致市场的反弹暂时夭折，从市场表现看，我们偏向于认为市场再次蓄势概率增加，同时市场的向好在等待政策的进一步明朗。从上周总体情况看，基本面偏于平静，政策面偶有因为两会的召开而刺激个别板块和行业的情况，而市场难有大的起落：上周沪深两市成交量分别6499亿元和4922亿元，较前一周均出现了超过20%的放量，但是受到关键点位的压制，同时短期获利了结的涌出市场出现下幅度回调，沪指下跌20.88点，幅度为-0.68%，而同期深圳指数下跌0.76%，市场再次蓄势的态势明显。从行业的表现看，上周仅有两个行业指数出现逆势上涨，其他所有行业指数均出现一致性的回调。两个上涨的版块分别为水电指数和建筑业指数，两者分别上涨了1.16%和0.09%；而下调的行业指数整体跌幅大多温和，下跌超过2%的行业为采掘指数，下跌为2.53%。而两外的指数多数下跌幅度在-0.5%到-1.5%之间，因此整体上市场处于温和调整状态。另外市场概念性的热点主要由政策利引导和推动，包括产业转移、区域振兴、新能源、节能环保、等均属于政策性的概念性交易机会。而本周将公布经济数据，而宏观调控政策明朗之前市场缺乏足够的做多动能。本周我们认为蓄势的概率较大，未来再次上行很可能将以明朗的政策信号为契机。同时坚持认为3月份仍然为调整的月份，二季度的行情仍然值得期待。因此短期看，我们认为市场再次上涨之前需要再次蓄势，而市场的很可能围绕着3000点附近进行，投资者立足于长远可以适当关注年报存在高分配预期的优质公司，同时重点关注具有明显的区域政策受益的中西部概念板块的交易性机会。但总体上依然注意仓位控制。就市场政策面看，虽然整体政策依然强积极的财政政策和适度宽松的货币政策，但从地产政策的调控来看结构微调可能会超出市场的预期，而地产调控政策的细化可能依然导致地产类股票的反弹的进度，从而整体上延后市场的系统上扬。正值两会的召开的当下，许多提案直指房产的高价，而各商业银行对地产的房贷政策的收紧很可能导致成交量难以出现实质性好转。而房地产业波及的行业板块较广，因此政策尚不明朗依然市场难有持续上扬的机会的重要因素。此外市场的流动性在二季度之前恐怕难有好转，一方面政策打击突击放贷，另一方面资本市场，特别是IPO市场持续分流资金这将对二级市场形成一定抑制。另外从基本面看，市场已经预期到了09年行业公司业绩大幅度回升的事实，但是对于10年依然存在诸多不确定因素，特别是国家宏观政策尚未明朗之前，各行业的业绩前景依然不过清晰，这是制约市场持续反弹的又一基本面的因素。因此我们认为短期市场恐难有系统性的机会，加之海外主权债务危机以及英镑的贬值等因素可能导致外围市场更加动荡，特别是近期美国贸易保护主义的愈演愈烈之势可能严重影响到中国外贸形势，因此国际上的不确定性是市场担忧的另一重要因素。所以总体来看，虽然年报出来的公司的业绩依然不断利好，但是市场各方面的担忧依然制约市场持续反弹，而且目前的A股估值水平出现了一定的结构性泡沫，特别是中小盘股的估值泡沫已经透支了其具有的增长能力，而政策对资产价格泡沫表现出严重关注，同时对通货膨胀都保持警惕。综合政策、资金和基本面的分析市场目前尚不具备持续上涨的动力，短期依然持保守态度。从技术角度来看，上周大盘反弹在关键技术位3100点(沪市)受阻，由此引发大盘可能再次回到3000点附近形成蓄势态势，同时也将形成市场二次筑底的形态。首先从形态看，市场经过持续反弹后已经反弹到前期三重头部的颈线位置即沪市的3100点，而上周四刚过3100点市场即引发了一次较为剧烈的下跌，因此市场再次回调蓄势甚至可能形成二次筑底的走势，而上周上涨受阻的位置同时是半年线位置，也是120周线位置，因此技术上属于关键的点位，该点位的技术压力明显，担起难以有效突破前期的技术颈线。其次从量能看，经过连续两周放量反弹后本周在关键位置出现放量回调，因此，这种量价的背离一定程度表前期的阶段性底部依然不扎实，市场有再次蓄势的必要，而超短期周五的走势看，量能再次显著萎缩，沪市从1400多亿元的成交快速萎缩到1000余亿元的成交表明当前杀跌力量也快速减弱。因此量能上分析市场当属于回调蓄势走势，本周在3000点附近蓄势的概率显著增加。最后，从技术指标看，虽然MACD指标依然处在0轴线之下的弱势阶段，但是，中短线显示持续上扬之势，两者均在持续向0的位置靠拢。而RSI、ADR和KDJ指标已经进入强势区间，飒三者的走势更趋于强势后的回调确认。因此，综合而言，我们认为市场回调蓄势的概率更高，一旦市场政策等因素明朗，大盘仍将震荡上扬。		正向	The rebound was blocked near 3000 or again Debon Securities Last week's market trend basically verified our weekly strategy report last week, that is, the short-term rebound space of the market was limited and it was hard to say systematic opportunities. From the trend last week, the market fluctuated slightly in the first three trading days, constantly approaching the key technical resistance level of the market. When it reached the important technical point of 3100 (Shanghai Stock Index) on Thursday, the market showed obvious pressure. The market showed a substantial callback on the same day, and it was hit by the short-term profit making, resulting in a substantial decline in the market on that day, and the trading volume reached a recent sky high, with the trading volume of Shanghai Stock Exchange reaching 146.7 billion yuan, and Shenzhen Stock Exchange also reached 115.7 billion yuan. The market's rebound was temporarily aborted due to the blocking of the key technical point, and from the market performance, we tend to think that the probability of the market's resuming its strength is increasing, and the market's goodwill is waiting for the further clarification of policies. From the overall situation last week, the fundamentals were quiet, and the policy side occasionally stimulated individual sectors and industries because of the NPC and CPPCC, but the market was hard to have big ups and downs: last week, the trading volume of Shanghai and Shenzhen markets was 649.9 billion yuan and 492.2 billion yuan respectively, both of which were more than 20% higher than the previous week. However, due to the suppression of key points, the market showed a downward adjustment when short-term profits were settled, and the Shanghai Stock Index fell 20.88 points, with a magnitude of -0.68%, while the Shenzhen Index fell 0.76% in the same period, and the market showed a clear tendency to resume its strength again. From the perspective of industry performance, only two industry indexes rose against the trend last week, and all other industry indexes showed consistent adjustments. The two rising sectors were hydropower index and construction industry index, which rose 1.16% and 0.09% respectively; While the industry index of adjusting the industry as a whole mostly fell moderately, the industry of mining and restructuring index fell more than 2%, down 2.53%. While the other indexes mostly fell between -0.5% and -1.5%, the market as a whole was in a mild adjustment state. In addition, the conceptual hot spots of the market are mainly guided and promoted by policy benefits, including industrial transfer, regional revitalization, new energy, energy saving and environmental protection, which are all policy conceptual trading opportunities. However, the market lacks sufficient motivation to do more before the macro control policy is clarified. This week, we believe that there is a high probability of resuming, and the future upward movement is likely to take the opportunity of a clear policy signal. At the same time, we believe that March is still the month of adjustment, and the market in the second quarter is still worth looking forward to. Therefore, in the short term, we believe that the market needs to resume again before it rises again, and the market is likely to focus around 3000 points. Investors can pay proper attention to high quality companies with high distribution expectations in the annual report, and focus on the trading opportunities of the central and western concept sectors which benefit from regional policies. But still pay attention to position control in general. In terms of market policy, although the overall policy is still strong positive fiscal policy and moderate loose monetary policy, from the perspective of real estate policy regulation, structural fine tuning may exceed market expectations, and the detailed real estate regulation policy may still lead to the rebound of real estate stocks, thus delaying the overall rise of the market. At the moment of the convening of the NPC and the CPPCC, many proposals pointed to the high price of real estate, and the tightening of mortgage policies on real estate by commercial banks is likely to lead to a substantial improvement in the trade volume. The industry sector involved in the real estate industry is wide, so the policy is still an important factor that the market is hard to have a continuous rise. In addition, the market's liquidity is unlikely to improve before the second quarter. On the one hand, the policy strikes a sudden lending, and on the other hand, the capital market, especially the IPO market, continues to divert funds, which will have a certain inhibitory effect on the secondary market. In addition, from the basic point of view, the market has expected the fact that the performance of industry companies will rebound substantially in 2009, but there are still many uncertainties in 2010, especially before the national macro policy is clarified, the performance prospects of various industries are still unclear, which is another basic factor that restricts the market from continuing to rebound. Therefore, we believe that the market is unlikely to have systematic opportunities in the short term. In addition, factors such as the overseas sovereign debt crisis and the depreciation of the pound may lead to more volatility in the peripheral market, especially the recent escalation of trade protectionism in the United States may have a serious impact on China's foreign trade situation. Therefore, international uncertainty is another important factor worrying the market. Therefore, in general, although the performance of companies that have released annual reports is still good, the market is still constrained by various worries, and the current valuation level of A-shares has shown a structural bubble. In particular, the valuation bubble of small and medium-sized stocks has overdrawn its growth potential, and the policy is seriously concerned about the asset price bubble, and it is also alert to inflation. In view of the comprehensive analysis of policies, funds and fundamentals, the market is not yet fully prepared for continuous growth, and it is still conservative in the short term. From a technical perspective, the rebound of the main market was blocked at the key technical level of 3100 (Shanghai Stock Exchange) last week, which triggered the possibility that the main market would return to the vicinity of 3000 to form a potential trend, and it will also form a pattern of secondary bottom building in the market. First of all, from the perspective of shape, the market has rebounded to the neckline position of the previous triple head, that is, the 3100 o'clock of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, after a sustained rebound. The market triggered a sharp decline on Thursday just after 3100 o'clock, so the market is likely to show a trend of resuming its potential or even forming a secondary bottom. The location where the market rose last week was blocked, and it was also the position of the line for half a year, and it was also the position of 120 weeks, so technically, it was a key point. The technical pressure of this point was obvious, and it was difficult to effectively break through the technical neckline of the previous period. Secondly, in terms of energy consumption, after two weeks of continuous trading rebound, there was a trading back adjustment at the key position this week. Therefore, the divergence of this kind of price indicates that the phased bottom in the early stage is still not solid, and it is necessary for the market to resume its potential again. The sharp decline of the current killing force on Friday also shows that the current killing force has also declined rapidly. Therefore, the market should belong to the trend of adjusting the potential in terms of energy consumption, and the probability of accumulating potential near 3000 this week is significantly increased. Finally, from the perspective of technical indicators, although the MACD indicator is still in the weak stage below the 0-axis line, the short-term and medium-term indicators show a sustained rising trend, both of which are moving towards the position of 0. The RSI, ADR and KDJ indicators have entered the strong range, and the trend of the three is more positive after the adjustment is confirmed. Therefore, in general, we believe that the market has a higher probability of resuming its potential. Once the market and other factors are clear, the market will still rise and fluctuate.
分析：WiMAX“屈尊”加入3G混战本报记者黄沙10月19日，国际电信联盟ITU在日内瓦举行无线通信RadioAssembly全体会议，与会国家通过投票正式通过，无线宽带技术WiMAX正式成为3G标准。WiMAX论坛在白皮书中称，将移动WiMAX加入到3G家族，为运营商升级网络提供了一条新的途径。“移动WiMAX正式成为3G技术之后，服务提供商在部署网络和推出服务时可以获得更多选择和更大灵活度。例如，它们可以在人口稀少的地区提供接入服务，或者在人口密集的地区提供增强接入服务。此外，全球开放标准有助于提升不同设备之间的互用性，降低设备成本，从而服务提供商将从中获益。”WiMAX的尴尬作为一项被认为是高于现有3G标准的“准4G”标准，WiMAX从诞生之日起就一直夺人眼目。WiMAX，即IEEE802.16x，全称叫做“微波存取全球互通技术(WorldwideInteroperabilityforMicrowaveAccess)”。和传统的TD-SCDMA、WCDMA和CDMA2000几个3G标准相比，WiMAX的最大传输半径达到了50公里上下，接近前者的两倍。而在传输速度上，WiMAX也让其他3G标准望尘莫及。在10公里范围内，WiMAX网络的带宽可以达到70Mbps，甚至超过了ADSL等有线网络的技术，而主流的无线GPRS最高传输速度是115Kbps，3G标准中的TD-SCDMA和WCDMA则均为2Mbps.随着技术的升级，WiMAX从2005年开始更分化出了802.16D和802.16E两个版本。802.16D为固定无线网络，能够作为wifi的升级直接与现有固定有线网络结合，受到了世界各地的欢迎。而移动无线网络802.16E却和移动运营商的现有网络发生了直接的对抗。然而就是这样一个含着金钥匙出生的标准，在提升移动性的同时却发现面临着没有频谱资源的严重问题。要在移动通讯领域争夺市场，最重要的一点就是要有一个全球统一的频段。但由于早在2001年4月，ITU就将最合适的频段都已经分配给全球三大3G标准WCDMA、CDMA2000和中国提出的TD-SCDMA.更要命的是，由于提交3G方案的截止日期早在1998年就已到期，按照ITU的惯例，3G标准已经冻结，不得其门而入的WiMAX面临着没有频段的尴尬。而没有频段，这项无线宽带技术完全无法实现区间漫游，而这对移动通讯网络来说是致命的。抵制在全球的4G标准迟迟没有确立，而3G网络建设如火如荼的情况下，WiMAX阵营坐不住了。从今年起，美国政府和WiMAX阵营的各家厂商展开了强大的公关游说工作，希望将WiMAX“降格”加入3G标准，在现有的市场上分一杯羹。据相关专家透露，从今年初起国际电联开始研究“OFDMATDDWMAN(802.16e，WiMAX的移动模式)”空中接口技术成为IMT-2000标准的可能性。但对于WiMAX申请加入3G标准，代表了此前3G三大阵营WCDMA和CDMA2000和TD-SCDMA的爱立信、高通和TD三方进行了强力抵制，而德国和中国等国家也表示了反对。展讯通信有限公司副总裁曹强博士认为，相比TD-SCDMA和其他3G标准，尽管WiMAX在造价、建网速度以及业务接入能力等方面存在着不可比拟的优势，但是WiMAX也存在着先天不足的尴尬局面。WiMAX支持移动性方面系统信令开销过大，小区边缘能力低；MobileWiMAX和FixedWiMAX在物理层面不兼容；标准化不全面，仅集中在L1和L2，缺少射频规范；标准化机制不健全，频繁的投票机制难以保证其完整性考虑；过多的选项导致系统开销增加和不稳定性，此外还存在着产品互通性差等问题。妥协与博弈但在各大利益集团的相互游说和妥协下，WiMAX阵营与政府、运营商、设备供应商和其他技术寻求合作，形成了一套“远交近攻”的频谱战略。目前3G无线网络的频段分为FDD(频分双工FrequencyDivisionDuplex)和TDD(时分双工TimeDivisionDuplex)两类，WCDMA、CDMA2000分享了FDD的频段，而TD-SCDMA则独占了TDD频段，而WiMAX在上述两种频段都能够使用。为了获得WCDMA、CDMA2000阵营的支持，WiMAX方面最终放弃了FDD频段。而对于支持TD-SCDMA的中国，WiMAX阵营也进行了紧锣密鼓的宣传攻关，连续2年将高规格的“WiMAX全球峰会”放在北京召开。在强大的公关下，WiMAX势如破竹地获得了多数阵营的支持。今年1月底，国际电信联盟8F工作组在喀麦隆举行会谈，着重讨论WiMAX成为3G中的一员；6月初ITU日本京都会议上，WiMAX技术顺利地通过了工作组级别的讨论；到了10月19日，ITU正式宣布，已经批准WiMAX成为ITU移动无线标准，即与WCDMA、CDMA2000和TD-SCDMA并列成为全球3G标准。在最终的方案中，ITU将WiMAX列为时分双工TDD(TimeDivisionDuplex)技术，和TD-SCDMA分享这一频段，TD-SCDMA阵营则成了最大的输家。“WiMAX成为3G标准堵死了TD国际化道路。”资深通信专家项立刚认为，WiMAX对于其他几个3G标准而言是竞争者，会瓜分掉部分市场，但对我国提出的TD标准而言，是一次重大打击。不过，WiMAX虽已被接纳为3G标准，但还在等待ITU为其指派频谱资源，博弈还在继续。	曹强,项立刚,黄沙	正向	"Analysis: WiMAX ""degrades"" to join the 3G melee. Huangsha, a reporter of this newspaper, On October 19, the International Telecommunication Union ITU held a plenary meeting of the RadioAssembly of the Geneva International Telecommunication Union. The participating countries voted formally to approve that the wireless broadband technology WiMAX officially became the 3G standard. The WiMAX Forum said in the white paper that adding mobile WiMAX to the 3G family provides operators with a new way to upgrade the network. ""After Mobile WiMAX officially became a 3G technology, service providers can get more choices and greater flexibility when deploying networks and launching services. For example, they can provide access services in sparsely populated areas, or provide enhanced access services in densely populated areas. In addition, global open standards help to improve interoperability between different devices and reduce device costs, so that service providers will benefit from it."" As a standard regarded as a ""quasi 4G"" standard higher than the existing 3G standard, WiMAX has been eye catching since its birth. WiMAX, also known as IEEE802.16x, is called ""Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access"". Compared with the three 3G standards of TD-SCDMA, WCDMA and CDMA2000, the maximum transmission radius of WiMAX is up to 50 kilometers, almost twice that of the former. In terms of transmission speed, WiMAX also makes other 3G standards inaccessible. Within 10 kilometers, the bandwidth of WiMAX network can reach 70Mbps, even exceeding the technology of wired networks such as ADSL, while the mainstream wireless GPRS has the highest transmission speed of 115Kbps, and TD-SCDMA and WCDMA in 3G standards are 2Mbps. With the upgrading of technology, WiMAX has been more divided into 802.16D and 802.16E since 2005. 802.16D is a fixed wireless network, which can be combined with the existing fixed wired network as a direct upgrade of wifi, and has won popularity around the world. However, the 802.16E mobile wireless network has a direct confrontation with the existing network of mobile operators. However, this is a standard born with a gold key. While improving mobility, it finds that it is facing the serious problem of having no spectrum resources. To compete for the market in the field of mobile communications, the most important thing is to have a global unified frequency band. But as early as April 2001, the ITU had allocated the most suitable band to the world's three major 3G standards, WCDMA, CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA proposed by China. More deadly is that the deadline for submitting 3G proposals has expired as early as 1998. According to the tradition of ITU, the 3G standard has been frozen, and WiMAX faces the embarrassment of having no band. Without bands, this wireless broadband technology can never realize interval roaming, which is fatal to mobile communication networks. In the case of 4G standards not being established globally and 3G network construction is in full swing, the WiMAX camp can't sit still. Since this year, the US government and various manufacturers of the WiMAX camp have carried out a strong public relations and lobbying campaign, hoping to ""downgrade"" WiMAX to join the 3G standard and get a share of the existing market. According to relevant experts, since the beginning of this year, the International Telegraph and Telephone Union has started to study the possibility of ""OFDMATDDWMAN (802.16e, mobile mode of WiMAX)"" air interface technology to become the IMT-2000 standard. However, Ericsson, Qualcomm and TD, which represent the three major camps of WCDMA and CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA, have strongly resisted WiMAX's application to join the 3G standard, and Germany, China and other countries have also expressed opposition. Dr. Cao Qiang, vice president of Spreadtrum Communications Co., Ltd., believes that compared with TD-SCDMA and other 3G standards, although WiMAX has incomparable advantages in terms of cost, network construction speed and service access capabilities, WiMAX also has the embarrassment of being congenitally insufficient. WiMAX has too large system signaling overhead in supporting mobility and low cell edge capability; Mobile WiMAX and Fixed WiMAX are not compatible at the physical level; Standardization is not comprehensive, focusing only on L1 and L2, and lacks RF specifications; The standardization mechanism is not sound, and the frequent voting mechanism is difficult to guarantee its integrity; Too many options lead to increased system overhead and instability, and there are problems such as poor product interoperability. However, under the mutual lobbying and compromise of major interest groups, the WiMAX camp has sought cooperation with the government, operators, equipment suppliers and other technologies to form a spectrum strategy of ""far diplomacy and near attack"". At present, the frequency band of 3G wireless network is divided into FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) and TDD (Time Division Duplex). WCDMA and CDMA2000 share the FDD band, while TD-SCDMA is exclusive to the TDD band, and WiMAX can use the above two bands. In order to win the support of WCDMA and CDMA2000 camps, WiMAX has finally abandoned the FDD band. For China, which supports TD-SCDMA, the WiMAX camp also launched a tight publicity campaign, and held the high-specification ""WiMAX Global Summit"" in Beijing for two consecutive years. Under the powerful public relations, WiMAX has won the support of most camps like a broken bamboo. At the end of January this year, the ITU 8F working group held talks in Cameroon, focusing on WiMAX becoming a member of 3G; At the ITU meeting in Kyoto, Japan in early June, WiMAX technology successfully passed the discussion at the working group level; On October 19, the ITU officially announced that it had approved WiMAX as the ITU mobile wireless standard, that is, it became the global 3G standard parallel to WCDMA, CDMA2000 and TD-SCDMA. In the final proposal, ITU lists WiMAX as a time division duplex TDD (Time Division Duplex) technology, sharing this band with TD-SCDMA, and the TD-SCDMA camp has become the biggest loser. ""WiMAX becomes a 3G standard to block the international road of TD."" Xiang Ligang, a senior communication expert, believes that WiMAX is a competitor to other 3G standards, which will take away some of the market, but it is a huge blow to the TD standard proposed by China. However, although WiMAX has been accepted as the 3G standard, it is still waiting for ITU to assign spectrum resources to it, and the game is still going on."
科比坐板凳把手感坐凉一打五暴扣仍难敌群狼发威新浪体育讯　北京时间11月6日，洛杉矶湖人队坐镇主场，迎战同城对手快船。这不过是湖人本赛季的四场比赛，但已经是第二次洛城德比了。湖人之前战胜掘金迎来三连胜，而在休整了几天之后，紫金军团又要上路了。一周前的第一场洛城德比，快船遭遇惨败，而今天拜伦-戴维斯希望复仇，也渴望拿下他来快船后的第一场胜利。而跟第一战不同的是，昔日联盟最佳防守球员坎比今天也首发出场，双塔对拼也是一大看点。快船对湖人，当第一节结束而分差在5分之内的时候，第二节会发生什么？毫无疑问，湖人会马上取得领先，因为他们有一帮活力四射的替补杀手。第二节的替补时刻是湖人的常规节目，拉马尔-奥多姆带着一帮替补，外加拜纳姆镇守内线，法玛尔和武贾西奇两个白人小个提供外围火力，这样的阵容果然奏效，第二节开始不过5分钟就把比分反超了5分。当然这跟两队上一场相遇时的情况有些不同，那次湖人他替补们的表现更加恐怖，不过反超比分总算是他们完成了任务。第二节还剩6分钟湖人重新派上科比加索尔，但小飞侠在板凳上坐了半天手感受到了影响，几次尝试自己进攻都没能命中。双方陷入苦战，得分都变得异常艰难。而在湖人用罚球连续得到4分之后，快船卷土重来了。戴维斯漂亮的抢断加索尔发动快攻轻松拿分，接着又是外线射手发炮，比分瞬间被反超。而科比则陷入低迷，他想要站出来接管比赛，但一次投篮在干扰之下弹筐而出，一次更是被逼到篮板后面投出三不沾。	戴维斯,科比,坎比,法玛尔,拜纳姆,加索尔,奥多姆,武贾西奇	正向	Kobe's bench cooled his hands and five dunks were still hard to beat the raging wolves. Sina Sports News On November 6, Beijing time, the Los Angeles Lakers played at home against their local rivals, the Clippers. This is only four games of the Lakers this season, but it is the second time that the Lakers have played against the Lakers. The Lakers had just won three consecutive games after defeating the Nuggets, and after taking a few days off, the Purple and Gold Army had to go on the road again. In the first Los Angeles derby a week ago, the Clippers suffered a惨defeat, and today Byron Davis hoped to take revenge and win his first victory since he came to the Clippers. However, unlike the first battle, the best defensive player in the league, Camby, also made his first appearance today, and the double tower fight was also a highlight. When the Clippers played against the Lakers, what would happen in the second quarter when the first quarter ended and the score difference was within 5 points? There is no doubt that the Lakers will take the lead immediately because they have a group of energetic substitute killers. The second quarter's substitution moment is the Lakers' regular program. Lamar Odom brings a group of substitutes, plus Bynum to guard the interior line. Farmar and Wujacic, two white little figures, provide peripheral firepower. This lineup really works. It took only five minutes at the beginning of the second quarter to overtake the score by 5 points. Of course, this is somewhat different from the situation when the two teams met last time. At that time, their substitutes performed more terrorly, but they have completed their task by over scoring. With 6 minutes left in the second quarter, the Lakers sent Kobe Gasol back, but the little flying saucer had been sitting on the bench for a long time, and his hand was affected. Several attempts to attack on his own failed to hit. Both sides were trapped in a hard fight, and scoring became abnormally difficult. After the Lakers scored four consecutive free throws, the Clippers came back again. Davis made a nice steal, Gasol launched a fast attack to score easily, and then the outside shooter launched a shot, and the score was instantly exceeded. Kobe fell into a slump. He wanted to stand up and take over the game, but one shot bounced out under the interference of the rim, and the other was forced to make three shots behind the backboard.
考研专业课最后十天冲刺：把握书本分析真题我们都知道这样一个规律：一般来说，公共课的复习效果不及专业课的复习效果快，投入相同的时间，成绩的增长量却并不相同。公共课像政治和英语，即使你花费再多的精力，在考试中也有可能很难获得很高的分数。因此，万学•海文建议众学子们：考研复习后期，在保证一定量政治、英语的复习时间上，在保证通过学校最低分数线的基础上，应多投入时间到专业课复习上。专业课的高分意味着你通过初试的几率增大。因此，提高专业课成绩，是提高考研总分的唯一途径。在距离考试的这最后十天的时间里，关于专业课的复习，希望大家注意以下两点：把握书本有些考生使用的是其他版本的专业课参考书，如果是这样，我建议您在考试前看一遍指定参考书。指定参考书是考试出题的依据，里面的一些内容是其他版本的参考书上没有的，或者比其他版本的参考书阐述的更全面，考生要熟悉这些新内容。考生可以看着指定参考书的目录，回想自己对某一章节的掌握程度，当发现某些知识遗忘了或者模糊时，打开书熟悉巩固一下。考试是有重点的，什么是重点，什么是非重点，可以根据历年考题，课后习题，课堂笔记，辅导班讲义等判断。考生应该花较多的时间在经常考的重点内容上。当然也不能忽视一些小字内容，一些不常考的知识,应该投入小部分时间在这些内容上,确保知识的完整性。分析真题理科考生的专业课考试中往往涉及很多计算。如果以前已经做过很多题目，现在可以不必埋头做很多新题目，可以花一些时间看以前做过的题目，想题目的解题思路、解题技巧、注意事项等。如果在以前的复习中，大部分时间都花在看书上，题目做的很少，现在就需要做一些题目。因为读懂了书，并不意味着能快速做题，能做对题目。通过现在的做题，检测一下自己对某些知识的掌握程度。做题过程中，发现自己的不足后，应及时寻找解决办法。比如做题粗心，就应该试着细心；忘记公式，就应重背公式。做的题目不应很难，花半天时间做对一道题目是的不值得的，抓基础和重点才是关键。考生如有历年试卷，应仔细研读试卷中的题目，试卷是一面镜子，在一定程度上能反映今年的考题。甚至在专业课考试中，不同的年份，会有相同的考题出现。做往年试题时，要试着把握出题重点，掌握出题规律，熟悉做题方法。对于考本专业的同学，一定要充分重视自己的专业学习，不能以为自己学了四年就一定比别人强，不然很可能阴沟里翻船。专业课最容易得分也最容易失分，如果你答错或答偏了一个大题，可能一下就和别人拉开了近10分的距离。除了看考试用书外，要注意多阅览与本专业相关的论文，最重要的是，本专业的学生在复习时要学会用一种专家的眼光看待业内的一些问题，甚至包括自己的复习用书，要敢于审问、质疑。这样在答题时才会有新思路，不人云亦云，这是专业课得高分的关键。当然大家要注意掌握分寸，不要发挥得太离谱。对于跨专业的同学来说，应该早点去听所考专业的课程，这有两个好处：一是早点积累专业知识，培养专业感觉；二是通过听专业老师的授课，尽早自己要考哪个老师的研究生，可以直接向老师表明心迹，让老师熟悉你、了解你，这样一方面自己的专业学习能够有人指导，另一方面会让自己的复试时心里有底，顺利很多。不过，最后的这几天可能说这个已经为时已晚，希望能给2010年考研的同学一个参考吧。最后，希望大家利用这最后的十天时间把握住考研的重中之重，拿下专业课的高分，那么，进入复试的几率就会大大增加。加油，学子们！祝你们好运！更多信息请访问：新浪考研频道考研论坛考研博客圈特别说明：由于各方面情况的不断调整与变化，新浪网所提供的所有考试信息仅供参考，敬请考生以权威部门公布的正式信息为准。		正向	The last ten days of the postgraduate examination for professional courses: grasp the textbook to analyze the true questions. We all know that there is a rule: generally speaking, the review effect of public courses is not as fast as that of professional courses. If the same time is invested, the growth of scores is different. Public courses such as politics and English may not get high scores in the examination even if you spend more energy. Therefore, Wanxue•Haiwen suggests that students should spend more time on the review of professional courses on the basis of ensuring a certain amount of time for political and English review and passing the school's minimum pass line in the later period of postgraduate examination review. High scores in professional courses mean that you have a greater chance of passing the preliminary examination. Therefore, improving the professional course score is the only way to improve the total score of the postgraduate examination. In the last ten days before the exam, with regard to the review of professional courses, I hope everyone can pay attention to the following two points: grasp the textbook. Some examinees use other versions of professional course reference books. If so, I suggest you read the designated reference book before the exam. The designated reference book is the basis for the examination. Some of its contents are not available in other versions of the reference book, or it is more comprehensive than other versions of the reference book. Candidates should be familiar with these new contents. Candidates can look at the catalog of the designated reference book to recall their mastery of a certain chapter. When they find that some knowledge is forgotten or vague, open the book to get familiar with it. The examination focuses on what is the focus and what is not the focus. According to the examination questions, class exercises, class notes, tutoring class syllabus and so on. Candidates should spend more time on the key content that is often examined. Of course, we should not ignore some small characters and some knowledge that is not often tested. We should spend a small amount of time on these contents to ensure the integrity of knowledge. Analysis of the true questions of science candidates often involves a lot of calculation in the professional course examination. If you have done a lot of problems before, now you can do not do a lot of new problems, but you can spend some time looking at the problems you have done before, thinking about the problem solving ideas, problem solving skills, matters needing attention, etc. If most of the time in the previous review was spent on reading, and few questions were asked, we need to do some questions now. Because reading a book does not mean that you can quickly answer questions or answer them correctly. By doing the questions now, you can test your mastery of some knowledge. In the process of doing questions, after finding their shortcomings, they should find solutions in time. For example, if you are careless in doing questions, you should try to be careful; If you forget the formula, you should reback the formula. The questions you ask should not be too difficult. It is not worth spending half a day doing a question. The key is to grasp the foundation and focus. If the examinee has the examination papers of the past years, he should carefully study the questions in the examination papers. The examination paper is a mirror, which can reflect the examination questions of this year to a certain extent. Even in the professional course examination, there will be the same examination questions in different years. When doing the examination questions of the past years, try to grasp the key points of the examination questions, master the rules of the examination questions, and get familiar with the methods of doing the questions. For students who are taking the examination of their major, they must pay full attention to their professional study. They must not think that they are necessarily better than others because they have studied for four years. Otherwise, they are likely to capsize in the gutter. Professional courses are the easiest to score and the easiest to lose points. If you answer or deviate from a major question, you may immediately open a gap of nearly 10 points with others. In addition to reading the examination books, we should pay attention to reading more papers related to our major. The most important thing is that students of this major should learn to use an expert's perspective to look at some problems in the industry when reviewing, and even include their review books. They should be brave enough to question and question. Only in this way, when answering questions, will there be new ideas, instead of following the crowd. This is the key to getting high scores in professional courses. Of course, everyone should pay attention to moderation and not overdo it. For students in different majors, they should go to listen to the courses of the major to be examined as early as possible. This has two advantages: one is to accumulate professional knowledge and cultivate professional sense as early as possible; The second is that by listening to the teaching of professional teachers, we can get to know which teacher's graduate student we are going to take the examination as early as possible, and we can directly show our heart to the teacher, so that the teacher can get familiar with you and understand you. In this way, on the one hand, our professional study can be guided by someone, and on the other hand, we will have a lot of confidence in our second round examination. However, it may be too late to say this for the last few days, I hope it can be a reference for students who are taking the 2010 postgraduate examination. Finally, I hope everyone can take the most important thing of the postgraduate examination in the last ten days, get high scores in the professional course, and then the chance of entering the second round will be greatly increased. Come on, students! I wish you good luck!

何冲6年一冠超越熊倪彭勃成中国男板大满贯第1人新浪体育讯　谁是中国男子3米跳板第一位大满贯得主？答案是何冲，今晚他在罗马世锦赛决战中有惊无险地夺得该项目金牌，继08世界杯、奥运会后又一次走上3米板单人跳冠军领奖台，罗马世锦赛的成功，使他填补中国跳水的一项空白——男子3米跳板大满贯。奥运会跳水赛四个传统项目，跳水国手填补的最后一项空白就是男子跳板，1996年亚特兰大奥运会熊倪与队友余卓成分获3米跳板冠亚军，攻克中国跳水在当时奥运赛场上的最后一个障碍。四年后的悉尼奥运会，熊倪蝉联3米跳板单人跳冠军，他还与队友肖海亮成为历史上第一对男板双人跳冠军，为自己的运动生涯划上一个完美句号。不过，熊倪却未能实现男板大满贯荣誉，因为他在世锦赛、世界杯赛场未获得过一枚单人跳板金牌。第二位奥运会跳板冠军是彭勃，他是在雅典奥运会获得这一荣誉的。与熊倪一样，彭勃在另两项大赛也没有摘取单人跳金牌。其实，何冲本有希望在北京奥运会就可实现“男板第一人”梦想的。何冲有着高人一筹的身体素质，2005年十运会年仅18岁的他力压彭勃、王天凌、罗玉通等国内众多高手，出人意料地夺得男子1米板冠军和3米板亚军。更早些时候举行的05世锦赛，初涉世界三大赛的何冲与王峰联袂夺得3米跳板双人跳冠军，单人跳紧随德斯帕蒂、杜迈斯之后名列第三。凭借一系列国际比赛的杰出战绩，06常熟世界杯前夕何冲已成为国内男板第一人，角逐三米跳板单人、双人和一米跳板三个赛项。当时何冲的全套动作难度系数在世界属于顶尖水平，还掌握着高达成3.8的5156B，被誉为“难度王”。常熟战役，何冲夺得后两项冠军，但在含金量更足的三米板单人跳决赛中，赛前夺冠呼声最高的他却在107B动作发生重大失误，此跳被裁判亮了零分，最终仅获第5名。一年后的墨尔本世锦赛，何冲又一次因为失误与金牌失之交臂。前两轮领先的他在第三、四轮连续出现失误，名次一下子落到第十，最终仅获第6名。连续两次失利也使何冲在三米板的影响力被秦凯反超。去年2月在北京举行的世界杯跳水赛，是北京奥运会前最重要的一次热身赛，那次何冲没有让机遇溜走，最终以15分的优势击败秦凯，夺得自己第一枚金牌。这枚金牌的获得，也为何冲后来冲击08奥运会金牌增添信心，并为今天实现男板大满贯殊荣奠定了基础。(王全立)	彭勃,熊倪,肖海亮,罗玉通,德斯帕蒂,王天凌,何冲,杜迈斯,王全立,秦凯,王峰,余卓成	正向	"Who is China's first men's 3m platform Grand Slam champion? He Chong is the answer. Tonight, he won the gold medal of this event in the World Championships in Rome without any risk. After the 08 World Cup and the Olympic Games, he once again won the championship of the 3m board single jump. The success of the World Championships in Rome made him fill in a blank of Chinese diving - the men's 3m platform Grand Slam. The four traditional events of the Olympic diving competition are the last event of the diving national team to fill in the blank of the men's diving board. Xiong Ni and his teammate Yu Zhuocheng won the 3m diving board championship and the runner-up in the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games,攻克the last obstacle of Chinese diving in the Olympic arena at that time. Four years later, at the Sydney Olympic Games, Xiong Ni won the championship of the 3m diving board again. He also became the first male double diving champion in history with his teammate Xiao Hai, drawing a perfect full stop for his sports career. However, Xiong Ni did not achieve the honor of men's board Grand Slam, because he did not win a single gold medal in the World Championships and the World Cup. The second Olympic diving champion is Peng Bo, who won the honor in the Athens Olympic Games. Like Xiong Ni, Peng Bo did not win the gold medal of the individual jump in the other two major events. In fact, He Chong had hoped to realize the dream of ""the first person in the male board"" in the Beijing Olympic Games. He Chong has a superior physical quality. At the age of 18 in 2005, he defeated many domestic experts such as Peng Bo, Wang Tianling and Luo Yutong, and unexpectedly won the men's 1m board championship and the 3m board runner-up. The 05 World Championships, which was held earlier, was the first world top three events for He Chong, who won the 3m diving board double championship with Wang Feng, and the single diving board ranked third behind Despati and Du Meis. With a series of outstanding achievements in international competitions, He Chong had become the first male player in China at the beginning of the 06 Changshu World Cup, competing in three events: single, double and one meter diving. At that time, He Chong's complete set of action difficulty coefficients were at the top level in the world, and he also had a 5156B as high as 3.8, which was called ""King of Difficulty"". Changshu campaign, He Chong won the latter two championships, but in the more gold containing 3m board single jump final, the most popular champion before the game made a major mistake in the 107B action. This jump was scored zero by the referee, and finally he only won the fifth place. At the Melbourne World Championships a year later, He Chong lost his chance of winning the gold medal again because of his mistakes. He made consecutive mistakes in the third and fourth rounds when he was leading in the first two rounds, and his ranking dropped to tenth place at once, and finally he only won the sixth place. The two consecutive defeats also led He Chong to be surpassed by Qin Kai in his influence on the three meter board. The World Cup diving competition held in Beijing last February was the most important warm-up competition before the Beijing Olympic Games. At that time, He Chong did not let the opportunity slip away. Finally, he defeated Qin Kai with a 15-point advantage and won his first gold medal. The acquisition of this gold medal also increased He Chong's confidence in his later attack on the 08 Olympic gold medal, and laid the foundation for today's achievement of the honor of the Grand Slam of male boards.

收盘：道指跌21点纳指跌9点新浪财经讯因政府报告显示九月份丧失工作人数高于预期，美股周五低收。劳工部表示，九月份共丧失26.3万个工作岗位，高于八月份20.1万个，也远高于经济学家的18万的预期，失业率上升至9.8%，创26年新高。就业报告通常被视为是一个月中最重要的经济报告，失业人数的减少是经济可持续复苏的关键。芝加哥IGMarkets资深市场分析师丹-库克(DanCook)指出，“过去两个月里投资者都以为就业市场已好转，显然，这不是事实。”截至收盘，道琼斯工业平均指数下跌了21.61点，报收9487.67点，跌幅为0.23%；纳斯达克综合指数下跌了9.37点，报收2048.11点，跌幅为0.46%；标准普尔500指数下跌了4.64点，报收1025.11点，跌幅为0.35%。八月份工厂订单下降0.8%，而市场预期为增长。这份经济报告也打击了投资者对经济复苏的信心。由于近期公布的经济数据欠佳，投资者开始质疑美股过去6个月里上涨50%的势头能否延续。美股在过去8个交易日里有7个交易日下跌。道指已从9月23日的高点下降了4.3%。纽约WynstonHillCapital合伙人BruceShalett指出，“就业报告提醒我们虽然形势较一年前有所好转，但问题依然多多。”HaverfordInvestments首席投资官HankSmith则表示，“市场的下跌将继续被看作是买进良机。”道指盘中最低下跌79点，收盘时下跌21点。纽约证交所总成交量从周四的60亿股下降至56亿股，股票涨跌比为1比2。道指本周共下跌1.8%，标准普尔500指数下跌1.8%，纳指下跌2%。道指与标准普尔500指数在三季度均上涨15%。三季度是道指自1998年以来表现最好的一个季度。国债市场有所下跌，10年期国债收益率从周四的3.18%上升至3.22%。美元对其它主要货币汇率涨跌互见，纽约商业交易所交投最活跃的黄金期12月合约上涨3.60美元，收于1004.30美元/盎司，涨幅为0.4%。11月轻质低硫原油期货合约下跌87美分，收于69.95美元，跌幅为1.2%。罗素2000种小盘股指数下跌了3.55点，收报580.20点，跌幅为0.6%。该指数本周总计下跌3.1%。法国CAC-40指数下跌1.90%，收于3,649.90点。德国DAX30指数下跌1.56%，收于5,467.90点。英国富时100指数下跌1.17%，跌破4,988.70点关口，收于4,988.70点。日本日经指数下跌了2.5%。	DanCook,丹-库克,HankSmith,BruceShalett,布鲁斯-沙莱特	负向	"Closing: Dow Jones fell 21 points and Nasdaq fell 9 points.

The employment report is usually regarded as the most important economic report in a month, and the reduction of the number of unemployed people is the key to the sustainable economic recovery.

考研辅导：复习进入瓶颈状态该如何突破？案例：小李汉语言文学报考华中科技大学语言学及应用学前段时间的复习比较顺利，感觉成绩提高也非常快。可是这两周以来，复习似乎进入了瓶颈状态。英语阅读没有太大突破，专业课进度也非常缓慢。辛苦一天下来，没有了成就感，人却变得越来越急躁。每天如坐针毡地呆在自习室里，复习资料翻了一遍又一遍，却一个字也看不进去，复习效率越来越低。要是一直这样下去，知识点根本看不完。我开始有些灰心了！当复习进入瓶颈状态时，人往往容易变得急躁、沮丧、灰心。此时重要的不在于突破知识点，而在于调整心态。试着深呼吸一下、在心里告诉自己不要着急、抑或在床头写上诸如“心平气和”一类的字样，相信你的急躁会慢慢远离你，自信会悄悄回到你身边。某教育机构张老师给大家支几招，希望能帮助大家突破瓶颈。1.真诚地接受坏心情的存在虽然我们每个人都希望自己永远拥有好心情，但事实上生活中总会碰到这样那样不顺心的事情，坏心情自然也不可避免。尤其是在复习考研的过程中，背单词、阅读短文、上辅导班、收集专业课资料等等事情多如牛毛，不可能事事顺利。所以，当坏心情存在时，首先要做的就是真诚地接受它的存在。如果我们不能真诚地接受它，因由坏心情的出现而焦躁不安，反而会使我们的心情变得更加糟糕。这样就会进入“心情不好——讨厌心情不好——烦躁——心情更不好”的恶性循环。当我们真诚地接受坏心情的存在时，我们的各种消极情绪反而会悄悄地溜走。这样就会进入“心情不好——接受心情不好——心平气和——心情变得好一些”的良性循环。2.改变看法，改变心情理性情绪疗法的核心观点认为：我们的情绪不是来源于事件本身，而是来源于我们对事件的看法。也许大家都知道一个经典的故事：两个人走在茫茫的沙漠上，他们都有半瓶水。其中一个人很焦急地说“糟糕，只有半瓶水了”，而另一个人却高兴地说“太好了，还有半瓶水”。同样拥有半瓶水，两个人的心情为什么截然不同呢？原来他们看待半瓶水的角度不同，一个人看到了消极的一面，而另一个人看到的是积极的一面。遇到不顺心的事时，换个角度看看这件事情，心情会有所不同的，正所谓“塞翁失马，焉知非福”！今天自我测试虽然成绩不佳，但从测试中找到了自己的问题所在；早上没能够早起背单词，但多睡了一会，精神饱满，更能够提高学习效率。3.积极的自我暗示关注了第29届北京奥运会的同学肯定知道，撑杆跳冠军伊辛巴耶娃在跳前都要蒙在被子里，准备起跑时嘴里还在嘟噜着什么。她为什么要蒙在被子里呢？她在嘟噜什么呢？事实上，伊辛巴耶娃蒙在被子里除了不让照相机干扰自己外，最重要的是在被子里调节自己的情绪，告诉自己“我是最好的”。从心理学的角度来看，这是她在进行积极的自我暗示。也是在北京奥运会上，李佳薇和张怡宁比赛时，我们通过镜头可以看到李佳薇手心里写着一个“稳”字。还有上文提到的郭芙蓉对自己说“世界如此美妙……”，这些其实都是在进行一种积极的自我暗示。在复习考研的过程中，我们也可以通过积极的自我暗示来调节自己的心情。早上洗脸时，对着镜子朝自己微笑；对自己说或在显眼的地方写上一些激励性的话语，如“我很棒”、“保持好心情，提高复习效率”等。这里特别要注意的是，千万不要给自己消极的自我暗示。不要总对自己说“我很糟糕”、“今天真的很倒霉”等话语。如果你总是对自己进行消极的自我暗示，你会发现你真的就会变得很糟糕、很倒霉。就如小品《卖拐》中，赵本山的几句“拐了拐了”就真的让范伟拐了一样。此外，同学们不妨试着调整复习思路，毕竟适合自己的复习方法才是最好的。很多同学们不了解自己的看书习惯或者阅读习惯，所以参考别人的复习方案，或者单纯图块，就为自己制定了一个名副其实的考研计划。其效果如何，可想而知。	赵本山,郭芙蓉,李佳薇,小李,张老师,伊辛巴耶娃,范伟,张怡宁	正向	"Postgraduate counseling: how to break through when review enters the bottleneck state? Case: Xiao Li, who applied for Chinese linguistics at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, has been well prepared for a period of time, and he feels very fast improvement. However, in the past two weeks, the review seemed to have entered a bottleneck. There is not much breakthrough in English reading, and the progress of professional courses is very slow. After a hard day's work, there is no sense of achievement, but people become more and more irritable. I sit in the study room like a needle every day, turn over the review materials again and again, but I can't read a word, and the review efficiency is getting lower and lower. If it goes on like this, there is no way to finish the knowledge points. I began to lose heart! When the review enters the bottleneck state, people tend to become impetuous, frustrated and discouraged. At this time, the important thing is not to break through the knowledge point, but to adjust the mentality. Try to take a deep breath, tell yourself not to worry in your heart, or write words such as ""peace of mind"" on the pillow. Believe that your impatience will slowly leave you and confidence will quietly return to you. Zhang, a teacher of an educational institution, gave everyone some suggestions, hoping to help everyone break through the bottleneck. 1. Sincerely accept the existence of bad mood Although we all hope that we will always have a good mood, in fact, there will always be such and such unhappy things in life, and bad mood is inevitable. Especially in the process of reviewing for postgraduate exams, there are many things such as memorizing words, reading short articles, attending tutoring classes, and collecting professional course materials, so it is impossible to do everything well. So, when bad mood exists, the first thing to do is to sincerely accept its existence. If we can't sincerely accept it, we will become more worried because of the appearance of bad mood, which will make our mood worse. This will create a vicious cycle of ""bad mood - hate bad mood - irritability - bad mood"". When we sincerely accept the existence of bad feelings, all kinds of negative emotions will quietly slip away from us. This will create a virtuous cycle of ""bad mood - accept bad mood - calm down - get better mood"". 2. Change your perspective and change your mood The core view of rational emotion therapy is that our emotions do not come from the event itself, but from our view of the event. Perhaps everyone knows a classic story: two people are walking in the vast desert, and they both have half a bottle of water. One person said anxiously, ""Bad, there is only half a bottle of water"", while the other said happily, ""Good, there is still half a bottle of water"". Why are the moods of the two people so different when they have the same half bottle of water? Originally, they looked at the half bottle of water from different angles. One person saw the negative side, while the other saw the positive side. When encountering unhappy things, take a different perspective to look at them, and your mood will be different, as the saying goes, ""The loss of a horse in Sai翁is a blessing in disguise!"" Although the self test today was not good, the problems were found from the test; In the morning, I was not able to get up early to learn words, but I slept for a while, full of energy, and was able to improve my learning efficiency. 3. Positive self暗示When paying attention to the 29th Beijing Olympic Games, students must know that Yelena Isinbayeva, the champion of pole vault, has to be covered in a quilt before jumping, and he is still mumbling when he is ready to start. Why does she have to cover herself in a quilt? What is she mumbling about? In fact, in addition to preventing the camera from interfering with herself, Yelena Isinbayeva's most important thing is to adjust her emotions in her quilt and tell herself ""I am the best"". From the perspective of psychology, this is her positive self暗示. Li Jiawei and Zhang Yining also wrote a ""steady"" word in their hands when they competed in the Beijing Olympic Games. Guo Fulong said to himself, ""The world is so wonderful..."" These are all positive self-suggestions. In the process of reviewing for postgraduate exams, we can also adjust our mood through positive self-suggestion. In the morning, when washing your face, smile at yourself in the mirror; Say or write some encouraging words to yourself in prominent places, such as ""I'm great"", ""Keep a good mood and improve the efficiency of review"". Here, we should pay special attention to that we must not give ourselves negative self-suggestions. Don't always say ""I'm terrible"" and ""Today is really bad luck"" to yourself. If you always give yourself negative self-suggestions, you will find that you will really become very bad and very bad. Just like Zhao Benshan in the sketch ""Selling Cane"", a few words of ""cane"" really made Fan Wei turn. In addition, students can try to adjust their review思路. After all, the review method that suits them is the best. Many students do not know their reading habits or reading habits, so they refer to others' review schemes, or simply make a plan worthy of its name for postgraduate examination. The effect can be imagined."

The excellent works that will be selected will win the Adworld2009 China Interactive Marketing Effect Award. The final evaluation results will be announced on July 9 at the ""Adworld2009 Interactive Marketing World - Summer"" held at Dong Junyue Grand Hotel in Beijing. At that time, all submitted cases will be played in a loop in the form of video on the spot. The excellent cases that have won the ""Case100"" award will also be invited to invite advertisers, creativity, production, media and other representatives to interact on the spot to comment on the advertising case. In April this year, DCCI officially launched the third party advertising effect measurement service of DCCIAdmeasure in China, and the advertising effect monitoring in China blew the assembly horn. This competition has achieved the goal of letting advertisers see the effect of advertising, the audience reached by advertising, and the real market effect generated by advertising. To truly achieve 360 degree multi-dimensional measurement of advertising marketing effect. On the principle of ""effect innovation"", the sixth competition broke the old pattern of similar competitions in the industry, and one of the changes was: the rules of the competition were rewritten by ""marketing innovation"", the top competition of China's interactive marketing industry, because it changed the standard for the Internet. Why? ""i-game interactive marketing sports meeting"", which has begun to show signs at the beginning of 2009. From ""online advertising"" to ""interactive marketing"", and then to ""cross media integrated marketing"", the Internet reflects the market competition rules: innovators need to have enough vitality and demonstrate real value, such as advertising and marketing, which may rewrite the rules. In fact, in 2009, the rewriting of this rule was more significant. Cross media integrated marketing award went out of the selection of interactive network advertising and entered the scope of media marketing innovation selection. After years of innovation, Internet new media has rewritten the definition of ""media"" in China, and reconstruction of the pattern of media competition and cooperation, the future market will belong to ""cross media integration planning and marketing"". Change 2: ""Marketing Innovation"" comes from media and technology innovation, which we have been talking about. Where does its power come from? It comes from the continuous innovation of media, including the birth of new media, which is inseparable from the progress of technology. Focus on media. Focus on creativity. It is reported that Adworld Interactive Marketing World is an annual landmark annual event in the field of China's interactive marketing and online advertising. It has been successfully held for six consecutive years, and it is the most authoritative and core communication and cooperation platform in this field in China. As an annual market weather vane, it has received high attention, extensive and in-depth participation from advertisers, agents, media and other upstream and downstream parties. Adworld Interactive Marketing World is guided by the China Internet Association, China Advertising Association and other organizations, and hosted by DCCI Internet Data Center.

男子在火车上强占他人座位收取让座费新快报讯（记者李国辉通讯员李文源）因在广州找工作碰壁，两名河北籍男子郭某、邵某为发财，竟在列车上强占他人座位收取让位费，结果被乘警逮个正着，分别受到了行政拘留、罚款的处罚。16日清早6时许，L308次列车自广州火车站开车后不久，一名旅客匆匆赶到乘警值班室举报称，有人霸占了他的座位还要强行收取让座费。乘警立即赶到事发车厢抓获了两名嫌疑男子，当场收缴非法所得款130元。据查，嫌疑人郭某和邵某均30岁左右，本月初他们从河北老家来广州打工，但因为没有技术又不愿吃苦，所以找了近半个月工作都没着落。想到国庆节临近，南来北往的旅客开始增多，他们便想了个霸占火车座位卖座位赚钱的法子。16日，两人买了短途火车票上车，抢在其他旅客前霸占了他人的座位，然后以30元至40元不等的价格向旅客收取“让座费”。两人在短短10分钟内即向旅客收取“让座费”130元，但随后就被乘警抓住。因其行为严重扰乱了公共场所秩序，侵害了旅客权益，韶关车站派出所对两人分别做出行政拘留10日和罚款500元的处罚。	李文源,邵某,郭某,李国辉	负向	"A man occupies someone else's seat on a train to collect a seat fee. The new express reporter (reporter Li Guohui, correspondent Li Wenyuan) learned that because of the wall in Guangzhou to find a job, two Hebei men, Guo and Shao, in order to make a fortune, actually occupied someone else's seat on the train to collect a seat fee, and were caught by the police. They were punished with administrative detention and fines respectively. At about 6:00 a.m. on the 16th, shortly after the L308 train started from Guangzhou railway station, a passenger hurried to the police on duty room to report that someone had occupied his seat and wanted to charge him for giving up his seat. The police immediately arrived at the incident coach to catch the two suspected men and seized 130 yuan of illegal proceeds on the spot. According to the investigation, the suspects Guo and Shao are about 30 years old. At the beginning of this month, they came to work in Guangzhou from their hometown in Hebei, but they did not have any technology and were unwilling to suffer, so they had no job for nearly half a month. Thinking that the National Day is coming, the number of passengers coming from the south and going to the north is beginning to increase, so they came up with a way to occupy the train seat and make money by selling seats. On the 16th, the two men bought short-distance train tickets and took the train. They occupied other passengers' seats ahead of other passengers, and then charged the passengers ""seat giving fee"" at different prices of 30 yuan to 40 yuan. The two men collected ""seat giving fee"" of 130 yuan from passengers in just 10 minutes, but then they were caught by the police. Because their behavior seriously disrupted the public order and infringed on the rights and interests of passengers, Shaoguan Railway Station Public Security Office made a penalty of 10 days' administrative detention and a fine of 500 yuan for the two people respectively."
