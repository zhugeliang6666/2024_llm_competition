Wii终翻身《使命召唤8》将发售Wii版动视日前表示，新作《使命召唤8：现代战争3》将会于今年发售Wii版。Wii众始终被或多或少的排除在《现代战争》系列游戏之外，当年的经典《现代战争1》就是在发售两年后才在Wii上退出了一款《使命召唤：现代战争反应能力》，而《现代战争2》更是压根没考虑Wii的事儿。虽然动视确认将发布Wii版游戏，但详细的开发进度并未透露，而且也不知道Wii版能否适用于“使命召唤：精英”服务平台。究竟Wii党能否得到平等待遇，小编围观坐等了。		正向	"The Wii finally turned to Call of Duty 8, which will be released as a Wii version of Activision, recently said that the new work Call of Duty 8: Modern Warfare 3 will be released as a Wii version this year.

悬疑剧《国色天香》开年热播叶璇揭开三大谜团新浪娱乐讯各类悬疑谍战剧逐渐培养出观众的“重口味”，如今年代情感剧也开始大打悬疑牌。由叶璇、刘恺威、何晟铭、潘虹、何赛飞等众多实力明星主演，金牌编剧于正制作的年代情感悬疑大剧《国色天香》就以精良制作、动人情感及引人入胜的悬疑故事带来了口碑收视双赢，被上海、深圳、贵州、昆明、湖南、河南电视台一致推举为2011年开年大戏登陆各台黄金时段。香港电影金像女星叶璇在剧中一人分饰苏雨宁、苏红玉两个重要角色，与刘恺威演绎了一段凄迷缠绵的“香水恋”，而由其扮演的苏红玉那谜一般的身世也成为该剧的一大看点。香水迷情炽烈情感疑窦丛生叶璇饰演的苏雨宁是百花岭上最富盛名的炼香师，她的知性与美丽也让百花岭上的香、宫两大炼香世家掌门人香浩宇(刘恺威饰)、宫少华(何晟铭饰)为之心动。虽然与宫少华早已定下婚约，但雨宁却一直把他当成自己的兄长看待，内心深处的真爱一直都是香浩宇。宫少华外出炼香期间，雨宁突然与宫家退婚并与香浩宇结合。突如其来的变故也使宫少华因爱生恨，伺机报复。而一个与雨宁外表一摸一样的女人苏红玉的出现，更加使得这之后的故事变得异常扑朔迷离……三大疑问开放式结局引观众热议《国色天香》制作阵容豪华、情节唯美浪漫、充满悬疑。此前在广州、湖北等地面频道一经播出便取得了收视冠军，更被观众、媒体称为“荧幕十年最动人的爱情悲剧”。而剧中围绕叶璇饰演的谜一般女子苏红玉的开放式结局，也引发了众多剧迷的热议。观众将“红玉身世”、“苏家大火”及“红玉肚兜上的‘辛氏’”并称为《国色天香》三大谜团。《国色天香》这三大最吸引人的谜团均与叶璇所饰演的苏红玉有着密不可分的联系，而直到全剧的结尾该剧都未给出一个明确的答案。也有观众认为，这样的安排是编剧故意为之以吸引大众眼球，但大多数观众由于该剧的精彩纷呈意犹未尽而非常期待这些谜题能在续集中揭晓。当被问及观众的以上疑问时，叶璇表示，现在看见的这个开放式结局恰恰是演员主创和导演商量后的结果，原剧本的结局是大团圆，但主创们一致认同应该把结局停留在女主角离去寻找身世的关键点，不仅能给故事结局制造悬念，更高明的是把原本局限于爱情里你侬我侬的主题摒弃，提升至寻找身份和人性灵魂之皈依的层次，拔高和扩展了全剧的立意，所以这一结局改动可谓画龙点睛之笔。不过，当原结局被删除后，叶璇坚持在片末按原剧本吟诵了“死者长已矣，生者自生存，还奖怜旧意，吸取眼前人”的诗句，皆因她认为此句是全剧的中心思想，不能随意删除，所以才有了现在观众们看见的版本，真可谓用心良苦，难怪该剧在问世后获得一片口碑好评与收视强档。	宫少华,潘虹,辛氏,刘恺威,叶璇,何晟铭,红玉,何赛飞,于正,苏红玉,香浩宇,雨宁,苏雨宁	正向	"The suspense drama ""National Beauty and Natural Fragrance"" was a hit at the beginning of the year. Ye Xuan revealed three mysteries. Sina Entertainment News All kinds of suspense and spy dramas have gradually cultivated the ""heavy taste"" of the audience. Nowadays, emotional dramas have begun to play the suspense card. Starring many powerful stars, such as Ye Xuan, Hawick Lau, He Shengming, Pan Hong, He Saifei, the age emotional suspense drama ""National Beauty and Natural Fragrance"", which is being produced by the gold medal screenwriter Yu, has brought a win-win public praise with a well produced, moving and fascinating suspense story, and was unanimously recommended by Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guizhou, Kunming, Hunan, Henan TV stations as the prime time for the launch of the 2011 drama. Ye Xuan, a Hong Kong film actress, plays two important roles: Su Yuling and Su Hongyu. She plays a sad and lingering ""perfume love"" with Hawick Lau, and Su Hongyu's enigmatic life experience is also a highlight of the play. Su Yuling, played by Ye Xuan, is the most famous fragrance refiner on the Baihua Ridge. Her intelligence and beauty also make Xiang Haoyu (Liu Kaiwei) and Gong Shaohua (He Shengming), the leaders of the two major fragrance refining families on the Baihua Ridge, fascinated. Although he has already made an engagement with Gong Shaohua, Yuning always treats him as his brother, and the true love in his heart has always been Xiang Haoyu. When Gong Shaohua went out to practice incense, Yuning suddenly withdrew from the palace family and joined Xiang Haoyu. The sudden change also made Gong Shaohua hate because of love and wait for the opportunity to retaliate. The appearance of Su Hongyu, a woman with the same appearance as Yu Ning, made the story after this even more complicated and confusing... The open ending of the three questions led the audience to discuss that the production lineup of National Beauty and Natural Beauty was luxurious, the plot was beautiful, romantic and full of suspense. Previously, it won the top ratings in Guangzhou, Hubei and other ground channels once broadcast, and was called ""the most moving love tragedy in the decade of the screen"" by the audience and the media. The open ending of Su Hongyu, an enigmatic woman played by Ye Xuan in the play, has also triggered heated discussions among many drama fans. The audience named ""Hongyu's life experience"", ""Su Family Fire"" and ""Xin's on Hongyu's belly pocket"" as the three mysteries of ""National Beauty and Natural Fragrance"". The three most attractive mysteries of National Beauty and Natural Fragrance are inextricably linked with Su Hongyu, played by Ye Xuan, and the play did not give a clear answer until the end of the play. Others believe that this arrangement is intended by the screenwriter to attract the public's attention. However, most of the audience are very eager to find out these puzzles in the sequel because of the drama's wonderful variety. When asked about the above questions of the audience, Ye Xuan said that the open ending he saw now was exactly the result of the discussion between the actor's main creator and the director. The ending of the original script was a happy ending, but the main creators agreed that the ending should stay at the key point of the heroine's leaving to find her life experience, which not only creates suspense for the ending of the story, but also cleverly abandons the theme originally confined to love, elevates it to the level of seeking identity and conversion to human spirit, elevating and expanding the purpose of the whole play, so this change of the ending can be regarded as a finishing touch. However, when the original ending was deleted, Ye Xuan insisted on reciting the poem ""The dead have grown up, the living survive, reward the old meaning, and absorb the people in front of them"" at the end of the film according to the original script. Because she thought that this sentence was the central idea of the play and could not be deleted at will, it was really painstaking to have the version seen by the audience now. No wonder the play won a lot of praise and ratings after its launch."
强制戒毒人员戒毒所内死亡死因经查为突发疾病广西新闻网河池讯(记者卢冬琳)4月6日凌晨，河池市公安局强制隔离戒毒所发生一强戒人员张某死亡的事件。经查，张某死亡原因为突发性疾病。7日晚，尸检工作已经完成，尸体已经被火化。善后工作正在有序进行。据河池市监所管理支队支队长黄甫章介绍，4月6日凌晨3时许，值班民警按例对拘室进行巡逻，当巡至张某的拘室时，听到张某躺在床上不停地呻吟。民警立即打开拘室，询问张某怎么了，并联系所内值班医生对他采取徒手心肺复苏等抢救措施，并拨打120急救中心电话，同时报告了监管支队和市公安局领导。凌晨3时58分，120医务人员赶到后，立即将张某送往河池市第三人民医院进行抢救。抢救半个小时后，张某因抢救无效死亡。黄甫章说：“事发后，我们立即成立了事件调查组，对值班民警和与黄某同一拘室的另外几名戒毒人员进行调查，均没有发现对张某有殴打、虐待的行为。同时，我们查看了当时的监控录像，也没有发现有上述现象发生。”据了解，调查组还对张某的尸体进行了检验，并未发现有外伤等异常情况。据介绍，张某死前未有任何异常反应，只在一周前出现过发烧咳嗽，经戒毒所医生检查治疗后，已经病愈。7日下午，调查组在与张某家属商议后，对张某尸体进行了解剖检验，同时于下午5时55分将尸体火化。张某家属在整个事件中情绪稳定。经查，死亡的强制隔离戒毒人员张某，男，43岁，河池市金城江区人，1996年开始染上毒瘾，曾被公安机关强制戒毒。今年3月4日因吸毒被拘留10天，3月14日转为强制隔离戒毒二年。	张某,卢冬琳,黄某,黄甫章	正向	"The cause of death in the drug rehabilitation center for compulsory drug addicts was found to be an emergency disease. Hechi News (reporter Lu Donglin) In the early morning of April 6, a compulsory drug rehabilitation center under the Hechi Public Security Bureau died of Zhang, a compulsory drug rehabilitation worker. After investigation, the cause of death of Zhang was sudden disease. On the evening of the 7th, the autopsy had been completed and the body had been cremated. The rehabilitation work is being carried out in an orderly manner. According to Huang Fuzhang, the leader of the management detachment of Hechi prison, at about 3:00 a.m. on April 6, the police on duty patrolled the detention room as usual. When they came to Zhang's detention room, they heard Zhang lying on his bed moaning. The police immediately opened the detention room, asked what was wrong with Zhang, contacted the doctor on duty to take rescue measures such as bare handed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, called 120 emergency centers, and reported to the supervision detachment and the municipal public security bureau leaders. At 3:58 a.m., 120 medical staff arrived and immediately sent Zhang to the Third People's Hospital of Hechi City for rescue. After half an hour of rescue, Zhang died due to ineffective rescue. Huang Fuzhang said: ""After the incident, we immediately set up an incident investigation team to investigate the police on duty and several other drug addicts in the same detention room with Mr. Huang. None of them found any beating or maltreatment of Mr. Zhang. At the same time, we checked the surveillance video at that time, and found no such phenomenon."" It is understood that the investigation team also examined Mr. Zhang's body, and found no abnormalities such as trauma. According to reports, Zhang had no abnormal reaction before his death. He had a fever and cough only a week ago. After being examined and treated by the doctors of the drug rehabilitation center, he has recovered. On the afternoon of the 7th, after discussing with Zhang's family members, the investigation team carried out an autopsy on Zhang's body and cremated the body at 5:55 p.m. Zhang's family members were in stable mood throughout the event. After investigation, Zhang, a 43 year old male who died from compulsory isolation for drug rehabilitation in Jinchengjiang District, Hechi City, became addicted to drugs in 1996 and was forced by the public security organ to give up drugs. On March 4 this year, he was detained for 10 days for drug abuse, and on March 14, he was transferred to compulsory isolation for drug rehabilitation for two years."
WAC联盟被指清谈俱乐部：沃达丰中移动难撼苹果导语：国外媒体2月21日发表分析文章称，2010年，包括沃达丰和中国移动在内的电信业巨头在西班牙巴塞罗那举行的世界移动通信大会(MWC)上宣布了一项重大计划，建立一个移动应用联盟，试图挑战苹果在应用商店领域的主导地位。但一年过去了，这个联盟不仅难撼苹果的霸主地位，还让应用开发商对其驱动变革的能力提出了质疑。以下为文章主要内容：应用程序社区(WholesaleApplicationsCommunity,以下简称WAC)旨在让应用开发商的工作可以变得更容易，无论他们采用什么样的设备。目前，应用开发商每次将其开发的软件应用于新推出的移动操作系统上时，都必须不断对其进行修改，以获得批准使用。WAC联盟CEO彼得斯·苏(PetersSuh)日前在巴塞罗那宣布，该联盟成员如今已达68家企业，同时还推出了一款新的软件工具，让开发人员可以在各类设备中推销他们的应用软件。包括爱立信、华为、西班牙电信在内的公司还推出了基于云计算的应用商店，将有助于向用户提供不受现有运营商主导的应用商店所控制的应用软件。问题是，缺席移动世界大会的恰恰是应用开发商自己。事实上，应用开发商和分析师都对WAC联盟表示了怀疑，认为它不过是电信运营商建立的一个“清谈俱乐部”(talkingshop)，这些运营商只是因无法从快速发展的移动应用软件市场分得一杯羹而感到不满。iPhone制造商苹果和谷歌在这个市场占据着主导地位，谷歌的开放源操作系统Android已被28家手机制造商所采用，同时还拥有自己的应用商店。据市场研究机构Gartner估计，2011年应用程序下载量将超过177亿个，同比增长117%。2011年应用程序的营收有望突破151亿美元大关，大概是2010年(52亿美元)的三倍。虽然许多移动运营商都拥有自己的应用商店，但苹果和谷歌仍然牢牢把控着这个市场。苹果应用商店的应用软件多达35万个，而谷歌也称其Android商店拥有15万个应用软件。虽然有人认为是否拥有大型应用商店与业务发展毫不相干，但分析师表示，这有助于商家与用户建立更牢固的关系，尤其是在用户要为应用软件付费的情况下。无论规模大小，应用开发商可以从两个途径赚钱，一是出售他们开发的应用软件，与应用商店分成，二是游戏中搭载的广告。市场研究机构Ovum高级分析师亚当·里奇(AdamLeach)表示，对于运营商来说，建立另一个适于应用开发商的生态环境，是“一项艰巨的任务”。苹果和谷歌已经建立了各自的应用生态系统，拥有自己的应用开发商项目。里奇说：“电信企业与运营商之间的合作一直以来并不成功。他们虽然拥有共同利益和开发新业务的美好愿望，但往往在达成某项标准上面临困难。”应用开发商同样认为，给每个新的操作系统调配应用资源将产生一些不必要的开支，需要额外的时间和精力去重新编写代码，而根据应用软件的复杂程度，这项工作的成本最高达数万美元。同时，应用开发商还对WAC联盟主导这场变革的能力提出质疑。芬兰开发商Rovio董事长皮特·韦斯特巴卡(PeterVesterbacka)指出：“如果可以带来变化，这的确是件好事，何乐而不为。过去几年，运营商推出了各种各样的计划，但没有一个能在市场上站稳脚跟。”深受市场欢迎的AngryBirds应用就是由这家公司开发的。应用开发商表示，即便建立了共同的标准，复杂应用软件要想应用于各种平台，也并不是一件易事。他们说，之所以受到苹果和谷歌Android平台的吸引，是因为这些平台具有多产而稳定的开发人员群体。而与电信运营商合作，并不一定能改善这种体验。(清风)	亚当·里奇,里奇,彼得斯	正向	"WAC alliance is referred to as a talking club: Vodafone China Mobile is hard to shake Apple Introduction: Foreign media published an analysis article on February 21, saying that in 2010, telecom giants including Vodafone and China Mobile announced a major plan to establish a mobile application alliance at the World Mobile Communication Conference (MWC) held in Barcelona, Spain, in an attempt to challenge Apple's dominant position in the application store field. But a year later, the alliance not only failed to shake Apple's dominance, but also made application developers question its ability to drive change. The following is the main content of the article: The Wholesale Applications Community (hereinafter referred to as WAC) aims to make the work of application developers easier, no matter what devices they use. At present, application developers must constantly modify the software they develop each time they apply it to the newly launched mobile operating system for approval. Peters Suh, CEO of WAC Alliance, recently announced in Barcelona that the members of WAC Alliance have now reached 68 enterprises, and a new software tool has also been launched, allowing developers to promote their application software in various devices. Companies including Ericsson, Huawei and Spain Telecom have also launched cloud computing based app stores, which will help provide users with applications that are not controlled by the app stores dominated by existing operators. The problem is that it is the application developers themselves who are absent from the Mobile World Congress. In fact, application developers and analysts have expressed doubts about the WAC alliance, believing that it is just a ""talking shop"" established by telecom operators, who are dissatisfied with their inability to get a share of the rapidly developing mobile application market. IPhone manufacturers Apple and Google dominate this market. Google's open source operating system Android has been adopted by 28 mobile phone manufacturers, and it also has its own application store. According to Gartner, a market research organization, the number of application downloads will exceed 17.7 billion in 2011, up 117% year on year. In 2011, the revenue of applications is expected to exceed the US $15.1 billion mark, about three times that of 2010 (US $5.2 billion). Although many mobile operators have their own app stores, Apple and Google still firmly control the market. Apple's App Store has 350000 applications, while Google also said its Android Store has 150000 applications. Although some people think that whether or not to have a large app store has nothing to do with business development, analysts say that it will help businesses and users establish a stronger relationship, especially when users pay for applications. Regardless of the size, application developers can make money from two ways: one is to sell their developed applications and share them with the app store, and the other is the advertising carried in the game. Adam Leach, senior analyst at Ovum, a market research institution, said that it was ""an arduous task"" for operators to establish another ecological environment suitable for application developers. Apple and Google have established their own application ecosystems and have their own application developer projects. Richie said: ""The cooperation between telecom enterprises and operators has not been successful. Although they have common interests and good wishes to develop new businesses, they often face difficulties in reaching a certain standard."" Application developers also believe that allocating application resources to each new operating system will generate some unnecessary expenses, requiring additional time and effort to rewrite code. According to the complexity of the application software, the cost of this work can be as high as tens of thousands of dollars. At the same time, application developers also questioned the ability of WAC Alliance to lead this change. Peter Vesterbacka, chairman of Rovio, a Finnish developer, pointed out: ""If it can bring about changes, it is really a good thing. Why not do it? In the past few years, operators have launched various plans, but none of them can gain a firm foothold in the market."" This company developed the popular AngryBirds application. Application developers said that even if common standards were established, it would not be easy for complex applications to be applied to various platforms. They said that the reason why they are attracted by Apple and Google's Android platforms is that these platforms have a productive and stable group of developers. Cooperation with telecom operators does not necessarily improve this experience. (Breeze)"
德克：爱骇客也爱史蒂文森不知道客场为何打得好新浪体育讯　北京时间5月23日(俄克拉荷马时间5月22日)消息，小牛今天在雷霆的主场球馆进行了训练，训练开始前，德克-诺维茨基接受了媒体的采访。第四场比赛如果拿下，那么小牛就会获得赛点，谈到如何取胜，德克认为：“昨晚比赛的下半场我们有些放松，让他们攻防转换得分，，我们明天需要变得更加犀利，并且要延续这样的表现很久。我爱我们的防守，我爱骇客(马里昂)付出的努力，我爱史蒂文森的顽强，这两人让比赛变得不同。”小牛客场战绩不错，常规赛28胜13负与热火并列联盟第一，在被问到原因时，诺维茨基谦虚道：“我不知道，在过去几年我们一直都是最好的客场球队之一，我不知道为什么。我们已经在一起一段时间了，我们喜欢和彼此一起打球，很多人都能打出好的进攻和防守。”上场比赛诺维茨基手感欠佳，谈到原因，德克说，“他们打得身体对抗很强，我试图突破，而裁判没有吹罚，所以我需要运球到内线找到机会。”泰森-钱德勒一直在系列赛中扮演出色的蓝领苦工，德克这样看待内线角色的变化：“这对于我们的内线是完全不同的系列赛，第一轮我们对位阿尔德里奇，第二轮我们对位拜纳姆、加索尔，这支球队外线更好。我们需要做的更好，移动我们的脚步，在挡拆上帮助彼此，昨天的比赛我们做的更好，挡拆防守做的不错。”季后赛首轮小牛在客场终结波特兰，德克认为这场比赛给了小牛信心：“是的，在波特兰的最后一场比赛改变了一切，我们知道了如何终结比赛。要想在客场赢球，我们需要打出更好的防守。”(新浪体育张海彦发自俄克拉荷马)	德克,史蒂文森,德克-诺维茨基,诺维茨基,阿尔德里奇,张海彦,泰森-钱德勒,拜纳姆,加索尔	正向	"Dirk: I love hackers and Stevenson.

We have been together for some time. We like to play with each other. Many people can play good offense and defense."" Nowitzki didn't feel good in the last game. Speaking of the reason, Dirk said, ""They played a strong physical confrontation. I tried to break through, but the referee didn't call, so I needed to dribble the ball to the inside to find opportunities."" Tyson Chandler has been playing an excellent blue collar worker in the series. Dirk looked at the change of the role of the inside line in this way: ""This is a completely different series for our inside line. In the first round, we played against Aldrich, and in the second round, we played against Bynum and Gasol. The outside line of this team is better. We need to do better, move our feet, help each other in the pick and roll. Yesterday's game, we did better, pick and roll defense Well done.""

老人摔倒无人扶身亡其妻随身带施救者免责声明湖北日报讯刘凯玲王琦“本人在人行道上摔倒被人施救，施救者免责。”这是家住武汉市汉阳知音西村87岁周婆婆，为自己写下并随身携带的一份声明。几天前，周婆婆88岁的老伴李爹爹，在路上摔倒后无人上前帮扶，终致鼻血堵塞呼吸道而窒息死亡。老伴摔倒无人帮扶含恨而去，周婆婆无奈写下“免责声明”，这既是一种自救措施，更是对信任与美德的一种呼唤。中国有句老话：救人一命胜造七级浮屠。老人摔倒在地，口流鼻血，无疑需要及时救助。然而现场只有人围观却没有人上前帮扶，这事实在令人痛心。对此，有网友指出，这都是南京“彭宇案”和天津“许云鹤案”带来的后患，因为万人做好事只要有一人被讹就完了。应当说，彭宇、许云鹤帮扶摔倒老人反而被讹为肇事者，确实在社会上产生了极坏影响。但是，我们要看到，这种误伤爱心的现象毕竟只是极个别的，根本不能代表社会主流，更不等于大家都认同，事实上大家对这类讹人现象都是强烈谴责的。在一个社会中，存在做好事反遭讹诈等现象，固然令人遗憾和不齿，但我们不能因此就忘记和丢掉了自己的道德责任。相反，我们更需要用恪守道德准则的行动，来旗帜鲜明地倡行良好道德风尚。拿极个别讹人之事来作不做好事的借口，对于急需救助的人不闻不问，这本身也是一种逃避社会责任的不道德行为。如果大家都这样，我们的道德家园就会荒芜，而这是一种更为可怕的世情。大哉仁者之心，爱如千年暖流。老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼。我们家里都有老人，我们也都有变老的时候，所以请不要吝惜我们的爱心。虽然，一个人的道德帮扶力量，不足以驱除讹人案的阴影，但是这绝不能成为我们冷漠待人的借口。我们人人都有坚守道德底线、建设道德家园的义务。只要我们都用良知和爱心来待人处世，世间就会变得更加美好。当然，要激活世人的向善之心，也需要健全搭建人际信任平台的机制，司法尤其要起到保护正义的作用。如果在行善有奖的同时还对讹人者施以重罚，那就更能从根本上导正人们的价值取向，从而引领人们积极践行助人为乐的道德观。	周婆婆,李爹爹,彭宇,王琦,许云鹤,刘凯玲	负向	"The old man fell down and no one helped him to his death. His wife carried a statement of exemption for the rescuer. Hubei Daily News Liu Kailing and Wang Qi ""I fell down on the sidewalk and was rescued. The rescuer is exempt from responsibility."" This is a statement written and carried by Grandma Zhou, 87 years old, who lives in Hanyang Zhiyin West Village, Wuhan. A few days ago, Grandma Zhou's 88 year old wife, Father Li, fell down on the road and no one came forward to help her. Eventually, nosebleed blocked the respiratory tract and suffocated to death. The wife fell down and left without help. Grandma Zhou had no choice but to write a ""disclaimer"", which was not only a self saving measure, but also a call for trust and virtue. There is an old saying in China: saving one life is better than building a seven tiered pagoda. The old man fell to the ground with a nosebleed in his mouth, which undoubtedly needs timely help. However, there were only people around the scene but no one came forward to help. It was really sad. In this regard, some netizens pointed out that this was a hindrance caused by the ""Peng Yu Case"" in Nanjing and the ""Xu Yunhe Case"" in Tianjin, because only one person who did good deeds would be ruined. It should be said that Peng Yu and Xu Yunhe were wrongly accused of helping the old people who fell down, which really had a bad impact on the society. However, we should see that this kind of phenomenon of hurting love by mistake is very different after all. It does not represent the mainstream of society, nor does it mean that everyone agrees with it. In fact, everyone strongly condemns this kind of corruption. In a society, there are such phenomena as being blackmailed when doing well, which is regrettable and contemptible, but we should not forget and lose our moral responsibility. On the contrary, we need to adopt the action of abiding by the moral code to clearly advocate good morality. It is also an immoral act of evading social responsibility to take very few things that are corrupting people as an excuse for not doing good deeds and to ignore people in need of help. If everyone is like this, our moral home will be deserted, and this is a more terrible world situation. Great is the heart of a benevolent person. Love is like a thousand years' warm current. The old and the old, the young and the young. We all have old people in our family, and we all have time to grow old, so please don't be stingy with our love. Although a person's moral support power is not enough to dispel the shadow of the corruption case, it can never be an excuse for us to treat others coldly. We all have the obligation to stick to the moral bottom line and build a moral home. As long as we all treat people with conscience and love, the world will become more beautiful. Of course, in order to activate people's goodwill, we also need to improve the mechanism of building interpersonal trust platforms, and justice in particular must play a role in protecting justice. If people are punished severely while doing good deeds with rewards, it will fundamentally guide people's value orientation, thus leading people to actively practice the morality of helping others."
农贸公司被指以改造名义填渠建房本报讯(记者史册实习记者黄海蕾)一家农贸公司以排水改造的名义在凉凤灌渠大兴区六合庄段填埋近千米渣土，居民却发现施工地出现“招商部”。众多居民质疑该公司以改造名义“谋取私利”。前天，南红门水务所表示，该公司填渠改造工程经水务部门同意，但建房不被允许，将密切关注此事。凉凤灌渠六合庄段位于庑殿路与南四环交界处西南角。27日，记者在现场看到，该段沟渠两辆挖掘机正在作业。几名工人说，他们受雇于六合虹达农贸市场经营者。约半个月前，他们在此开始施工，平整土地后将在渠上建一排钢结构房屋，“面积有2万平米，国庆就能建成”。在工人指引下，记者来到该农贸公司招商部，看到其在此新建商业、工业园区的规划图显示，该段渠道上将建一排2或3层的房屋。工作人员称，此处建成后可商用或租住，“但现在动不动工还说不清楚，招商的时候你们再来吧”。记者致电该农贸公司一名王姓经理，对方听说有人投诉其公司欲建房即表示“不可能，瞎说”。居民们表示欢迎沟渠改造，但对可能出现填渠建房的做法不满，认为此是“个别人谋取私利”。大兴区水务局南红门水务所所长吕新说，此段灌渠一直存在脏乱、排污水等难题，水务部门欲改造，但因经费问题未动工。上个月，该农贸市场自行填渠，他们收到举报后勒令其停工，但农贸市场有意出资改造该段灌渠，遂同意由其进行施工，但未允许其建房。吕新表示，水务局已收到该公司填渠建房的举报，将密切关注此事进展，一旦发现其建房定会制止。	凉凤,吕新,黄海蕾	负向	"A farmer's trade company is accused of filling canals and building houses in the name of reconstruction. (Huang Hailei, a reporter who is an intern in the reporter's history) A farmer's trade company buried nearly kilometers of muck in Liuhezhuang section of Daxing District, Liangfeng Irrigation Canal in the name of drainage reconstruction, but residents found that there was a ""Ministry of Investment Promotion"" in the construction site. Many residents questioned that the company ""seeks private interests"" in the name of transformation. The day before yesterday, Nanhongmen Water Affairs Office said that the company's canal filling and reconstruction project was approved by the water department, but the building was not allowed, and it will pay close attention to this matter. Liuhezhuang Section of Liangfeng Irrigation Canal is located at the southwest corner of the junction of Wudian Road and South Fourth Ring Road. On the 27th, the reporter saw at the scene that two excavators in this section of ditch were working. Several workers said that they were employed by the operator of Liuhe Hongda Agricultural Trade Market. About half a month ago, they started construction here. After leveling the land, they will build a row of steel structure houses on the canal, ""with an area of 20000 square meters, the National Day will be completed"". Under the guidance of the workers, the reporter came to the Investment Promotion Department of the agricultural trade company and saw that the planning map of its new commercial and industrial park here showed that a row of 2 or 3 storey houses would be built in this channel. The staff said that this place can be used for commercial or rent after completion, ""but it is not clear whether to start construction now. Come back when you invite investment"". The reporter called a manager surnamed Wang of the agricultural trade company. The other party said ""impossible, nonsense"" when he heard that someone complained that his company wanted to build a house. The residents welcomed the ditch reconstruction, but they were dissatisfied with the possible practice of filling ditches and building houses, and thought it was ""an individual seeking personal gain"". Lv Xin, director of Nanhongmen Water Affairs Office of Daxing District Water Affairs Bureau, said that this section of irrigation canal has always been messy, sewage drainage and other problems. The water department wanted to transform it, but it did not start construction because of funding problems. Last month, the farmer's market filled the canal on its own. After receiving the report, they ordered it to stop working. However, the farmer's market intended to invest in the reconstruction of the irrigation canal, so it agreed to let it construct, but did not allow it to build houses. Lv Xin said that the Water Authority had received a report from the company on canal filling and housing construction, and would pay close attention to the progress of this matter, and would stop its housing construction once it was found."
渗透互联网：中国移动的野心马晓芳中国移动(00941.HK)的互联网战略正在逐渐高调和明确。昨天，中国移动董事长王建宙在达沃斯接受有关媒体采访时表示，随着移动互联网时代的来临，中国移动不排除收购互联网公司。从两年前提出，中国移动需要“互联网疯子”，首次明确中国移动对互联网行业的向往，到如今明确提出可能收购互联网公司，中国移动正在表现出对互联网越来越大的野心。如果中国最大的电信公司与中国市值最高的互联网公司走到一起，结果将会怎么样？昨天，市场再次传言称，王建宙表示不排除收购腾讯部分股权的可能，随后中国移动和腾讯的股价同时开始上涨。昨日收盘时，腾讯报收150.30港元，上涨5.92%。传言的源头是2009年的最后一天，王建宙的一次深圳之行。连续拜访了酷派、腾讯等多家企业，并与腾讯的主要管理层合影留念，该照片流传出来之后，被认为是中国移动有意收购腾讯，甚至双方已经基本达成一致的一个证明。不过昨天，中国移动上市公司发言人雷雨表示，王建宙去年对腾讯的拜访只是参观和学习，并无意收购腾讯，无论是全资还是部分参股的方式。而王建宙本人也做出解释，“去年我跟我的同事专门去了一趟腾讯，我们是向互联网公司学习去了，仅此而已。”王建宙表示，中国移动不可能“通吃”产业链，没有一个企业或者一个人能够通吃，比较共同的意见是双方采取合作的方式。“我们毕竟不是其他行业的专家，涉及到需要我们做其中一部分工作，我们可以合作，也可以进行一部分的收购，这也是可能的，但总体而言，移动是采取合作的方法。”他说，因此在整体的互联网战略上，如果有机会的话，不排除收购的可能。值得注意的是，在中国移动的整体战略中，摆在一个更重要位置的是移动互联网，所以中国移动才会在去年与沃达丰、软银成立联合实验室，腾讯更多的是一个传统互联网公司，其移动互联网业务多是依托中国移动，以SP的身份获得的。包括腾讯最核心的业务QQ，中国移动从中学习和借鉴之后，推出了飞信，到2009年底为止，飞信的活跃用户达到5600万，继续维持仅次于QQ的第二大即时通讯工具地位。从这个角度来说，中国移动与腾讯的业务并没有太多互补之处。不过，在中国移动进军移动互联网的途中，将与更多的互联网公司相遇。比如中国移动发展MobileMarket的过程中，将与同样转型互联网的诺基亚形成竞争。而中国移动自身也涌现并培养出更多的专业互联网公司，比如139“说客”就瞄准了目前最火的SNS业务微博(http://t.sina.com.cn)。	王建宙,马晓芳,雷雨	正向	"Infiltrating the Internet: China Mobile's ambition Ma Xiaofang China Mobile (00941. HK)'s Internet strategy is becoming increasingly high-profile and clear. Yesterday, Wang Jianzhou, Chairman of China Mobile, said in an interview with relevant media in Davos that with the advent of the mobile Internet era, China Mobile did not rule out acquiring Internet companies. From two years ago, China Mobile proposed that it needs ""Internet madman"", and for the first time made clear that China Mobile aspired to the Internet industry, to now, it has made clear that it may acquire Internet companies, and China Mobile is showing growing ambitions for the Internet. What will happen if China's largest telecommunications company and China's most valuable Internet company come together? Yesterday, there was another rumor in the market that Wang Jianzhou said he could not rule out the possibility of acquiring some shares of Tencent, and then the shares of China Mobile and Tencent began to rise at the same time. At the close of yesterday, Tencent closed at HK $150.30, up 5.92%. The source of the rumor was Wang Jianzhou's trip to Shenzhen on the last day of 2009. He visited many enterprises such as Coolpad and Tencent and took a group photo with Tencent's main management. After the photo was circulated, it was considered as a proof that China Mobile intended to acquire Tencent, and even the two sides had basically reached an agreement. But yesterday, Lei Yu, spokesman of China Mobile's listed company, said that Wang Jianzhou's visit to Tencent last year was just a visit and study, and he had no intention of acquiring Tencent, either wholly or partly. Wang Jianzhou himself also explained, ""Last year, I went to Tencent with my colleagues, and we learned from Internet companies, that's all."" Wang Jianzhou said that China Mobile could not ""take all"" the industrial chain, and no enterprise or one person could take all. The common view is that the two sides should adopt a cooperative approach. ""After all, we are not experts in other industries. When it comes to the need for us to do some of the work, we can cooperate or make some acquisitions, which is also possible. But in general, mobile is a cooperative approach."" He said, therefore, in terms of the overall interconnection strategy, if there is an opportunity, we do not rule out the possibility of acquisitions. It is worth noting that in the overall strategy of China Mobile, the mobile Internet plays a more important role, so China Mobile set up a joint laboratory with Vodafone and Softbank last year. Tencent is more of a traditional Internet company, and its mobile Internet business is mostly obtained by relying on China Mobile as an SP. Including QQ, the core business of Tencent, China Mobile launched Feixin after learning from it. By the end of 2009, Feixin had 56 million active users, maintaining its position as the second largest instant messaging tool after QQ. From this perspective, China Mobile and Tencent do not have much complementary business. However, China Mobile will meet more Internet companies on its way to mobile Internet. For example, in the process of developing MobileMarket, China Mobile will compete with Nokia, which is also transforming the Internet. China Mobile itself has also emerged and cultivated more professional Internet companies, such as 139 ""lobbyists"" targeting the most popular SNS microblog（ http://t.sina.com.cn ）."

男子被借种生子骗局骗走万元□记者韩景玮通讯员熊晓辉本报讯“娜娜出500万借种生子”、“私企女老板出30万寻游伴”，郑州两男子看到上述广告后，梦想一夜暴富，没想到落入不法婚介设的圈套，不但没拿着巨款，还“搭进去”28960元。10月15日，郑州金水区法院向媒体透露：二审法院已审结此案，判处婚介女老板范某有期徒刑1年，参与此案的两女子则分别被判处拘役5个月。馅饼富女出500万报酬“借种”今年4月的一天，闲来无事的王先生在某报纸上看见这样一则广告：一个名为“娜娜”的女子，想寻找一名男子共孕一子，事成之后给500万元报酬。这则广告让王先生心动不已，王先生决定一试。王先生拨通电话后，一女子让他和一个叫娜娜的女孩通电话。两人沟通多次后，娜娜表示对王先生的条件满意，但要在各种法律手续齐备的情况下再谈下一步做法，并称这样做是为了保护双方的权益。王先生在娜娜等人的提示下，先后向对方的银行卡内，交了中介费、公证费、个人所得税9980元。而随着对方一次次开口要钱，王先生越来越感到不对头。娜娜发现王先生已有所察觉，遂以二人没缘分为由，彻底和王先生断绝了联系。无独有偶，同样被骗的还有余先生，也是今年4月的一天，余先生在媒体上看到这样一则广告：“成熟私企女老总，重金寻伴游，并付酬金30万元。”虽然这则广告没有王先生看到的广告诱人，但是余先生同样被骗走18980元。二人发现被骗后，分别报警。警方调查发现，原来这是一则利用婚介信息进行诈骗的广告，幕后实施诈骗的是一个名为“七彩虹”婚介所的女老板范某以及她的两名员工。而那名叫做“娜娜”的女子就是其中一名女员工，这个团伙通过在报纸和杂志上发布婚介信息，来吸引受骗者与之联系然后实施诈骗。露馅三女子涉嫌诈骗被判刑今年7月19日，郑州金水区法院对该案进行了判决，认定范某等3人的行为构成诈骗罪，判处范某有期徒刑1年零3个月，判处陈某和化名娜娜的郭某各拘役5个月。范某不服一审判决，提出上诉。二审法院认定，3人采用虚构事实、隐瞒真相的方法，骗取他人财物，数额巨大，其行为均构成诈骗罪。原判证据确实充分，定罪准确、审判程序合法。但结合本案犯罪事实，犯罪性质、对社会的危害程度，上诉人范某认罪悔罪态度、已全部退赃，二审期间，其家人已积极赔偿受害人，并得到受害人的谅解，应从轻处理，适用缓刑。遂判处范某有期徒刑1年，缓刑3年。仍判处化名“李老师”的陈某和化名“娜娜”的郭某拘役5个月，缓刑8个月。3人各处罚金5000元。	范某,郭某,熊晓辉,余先生,李老师,韩景玮,王先生,陈某,娜娜	负向	"A man was cheated out of ten thousand yuan by a child borrowing scam □ Reporter Han Jingwei's correspondent Xiong Xiaohui reported from our newspaper that ""Nana gave five million yuan for child borrowing"" and ""female bosses of private enterprises gave 300000 yuan for travel partners"". After seeing the above advertisement, two men in Zhengzhou dreamed of becoming rich overnight. Unexpectedly, they fell into the trap set by the illegal matchmaking agency. Instead of taking huge money, they ""took in"" 28960 yuan. On October 15, the court of Jinshui District, Zhengzhou, revealed to the media that the court of second instance had concluded the case and sentenced the matrimonial female boss Fan to one year's imprisonment. The two women involved in the case were sentenced to five months' detention respectively. One day in April this year, Mr. Wang, who had nothing to do, saw an advertisement in a newspaper that said a woman named ""Nana"" wanted to find a man who was pregnant with a child, and he would give a reward of 5 million yuan after his success. This advertisement made Mr. Wang so excited that he decided to have a try. After Mr. Wang dialed the phone, a woman asked him to talk to a girl named Nana. After many communications between the two people, Nana said that she was satisfied with Mr. Wang's conditions, but she would talk about the next step when all legal procedures were complete, and said that it was to protect the rights and interests of both parties. At the prompt of Nana and others, Mr. Wang successively paid 9980 yuan of intermediary fees, notarial fees and personal income tax to each other's bank card. As the other side asked for money again and again, Mr. Wang felt more and more wrong. Nana found that Mr. Wang had noticed that, so she broke off contact with Mr. Wang completely on the ground that they were not destined. Coincidentally, Mr. Yu was also cheated. On the same day in April this year, Mr. Yu saw an advertisement in the media: ""A mature female boss of a private enterprise pays a lot of money to find a companion and pay 300000 yuan."" Although this advertisement is not as attractive as the advertisement Mr. Wang saw, Mr. Yu was also cheated of 18980 yuan. When they find that they have been cheated, they call the police respectively. The police investigation found that this was an advertisement that used matchmaking information to defraud. Behind the scenes was Fan, a female boss of a matchmaking agency named ""Seven Rainbows"", and her two employees. The woman named ""Nana"" is one of the female employees. The gang publishes matchmaking information in newspapers and magazines to attract the cheated to contact them and then commit fraud. On July 19 of this year, the court of Jinshui District, Zhengzhou, sentenced three women who were suspected of fraud, and found that the behavior of Fan and other three people constituted a crime of fraud. Fan was sentenced to one year and three months' imprisonment, and Chen and Guo, who took the pseudonym of Nana, were sentenced to five months' detention respectively. Fan appealed against the first instance verdict. The court of second instance found that the three people used the method of fabricating facts and concealing the truth to defraud others of their property in a huge amount, and their acts constituted the crime of fraud. The evidence in the original judgment is indeed sufficient, the conviction is accurate, and the trial procedure is legal. However, in combination with the criminal facts of the case, the nature of the crime, and the degree of harm to society, the appellant Fan has confessed his guilt and repentance, and has returned all the stolen goods. During the second instance, his family has actively compensated the victim, and has received the victim's understanding, so he should be given a lighter punishment and be suspended. Fan was sentenced to one year's imprisonment and three years' probation. Chen, who was pseudonymous ""Teacher Li"", and Guo, who was pseudonymous ""Nana"", were still sentenced to five months' detention and eight months' probation. RMB 5000 will be fined for each of the three persons."

In addition to a slight rebound in the morning, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets continued to plunge sharply in the afternoon. Ninety percent of the shares fell, and dozens of individual stocks fell by the limit. The number of individual stocks that fell more than 5% was not counted. 5. The 10 day moving average was turned back to its original shape and turned from the support line of A-share to the pressure line. Finally, both Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes ended down on a long negative line. The Shanghai Composite Index once again approached the 2500 point integer pass, and the Shenzhen Composite Index lost 10000 points. The trading volume of the two cities has increased from the day before yesterday, which can be analyzed as an obvious panic disk overflow. The World Cup football match was really wonderful. Argentina beat South Korea 4-1, and Messi's charm was amazing to the world. However, the overall market after the Dragon Boat Festival is really unnerving. The stock index fell for two consecutive days, and many stocks fell beyond recognition in two trading days. The overall decline of less than 2% is still due to the fact that there are index stocks supporting it, but it is hard to hide the fact that individual stocks have fallen sharply. The characteristics of the market show the ""February 8th"" phenomenon. The strong pharmaceutical sector, the Internet of Things sector and the electronic information sector continued to make up for the decline, and many stocks have shown signs of breaking down. How to view this phenomenon? Is it another inevitable doom? Does hope really not exist? No! In the first half of the year, nearly 20 new funds were issued, with 40 billion new blood coming into the market, industrial capital repurchasing its own stocks long ago, insurance funds should increase the upper limit of stock investment funds, and social security funds should gradually increase the proportion of funds invested in stocks, which fully shows that opportunities are at hand! Historically, the coverage of strong stocks often means that the index has entered the end of a round of adjustment. After the rapid adjustment of most other sectors, it is difficult for the market to find the motivation to short in the short term. At this time, the strong overvalued plate with a small adjustment in the earlier period became the main source of short chips for the bears. And this vent of empty energy is more radical in the period of stock index futures. Once the process of covering the decline of strong stocks ends, the stock index is expected to enter the stage of long short reversal. The early rapid decline has fully reflected pessimistic expectations. At present, the valuation of many stocks and sectors has been comparable to the most difficult period of the 2008 economic crisis. In 2008, the market was extremely pessimistic, including the risk of bankruptcy of many enterprises. The current economic environment is significantly better than that in 2008, and the decline of the stock market is indeed excessive. The main task of the market is still to find out the bottom. In the short term, we should pay attention to whether the Shanghai Stock Index can effectively stabilize near 2500. There is no industrial opportunity, and we can only select individual stocks to participate in band trading."
伊拉克爆炸逾70人死近200人伤(组图)中新网6月21日电综合美联社等媒体报道，伊拉克北部基尔库克市附近20日发生卡车炸弹爆炸事件，已导致超过70人死亡，将近200人受伤。这是今年以来伊拉克发生的最严重的爆炸事件。当时很多民众在一家什叶派清真寺参加完聚祷后正在离开。这家清真寺由土库曼少数族裔社区所管理。目击者说，爆炸威力几乎把清真寺夷为平地，附近十多座土砖建的房子有部分倒下，有人被埋在瓦砾中。基尔库克是伊拉克北部一个多民族杂居的地区。当地的库尔德人、土库曼人与阿拉伯人正在争夺那里的石油储藏。最近怀疑是逊尼派伊斯兰颠覆分子曾攻击当地的其它宗教群体，以及伊拉克和美军部队。这起攻击发生之际，正是美军部队准备从伊拉克城镇撤出的时候。爆炸发生数小时前，伊拉克总理马利基表示美军撤出的计划如期进行，他称之为“重大胜利”。	马利基	负向	"More than 70 people were killed and nearly 200 were injured in the Iraqi explosion (photo) China News Network, June 21- The Associated Press and other media reported that a truck bomb explosion near Kirkuk in northern Iraq on the 20th had led to more than 70 deaths and nearly 200 injuries. This is the most serious explosion in Iraq since this year. At that time, many people were leaving after attending prayer at a Shiite mosque. The mosque is managed by the Turkmen minority community. Witnesses said that the mosque was almost razed to the ground by the force of the explosion. More than a dozen adobe houses nearby partially collapsed, and some people were buried in the rubble. Kirkuk is a multi-ethnic area in northern Iraq. The local Kurds, Turkmen and Arabs are competing for oil reserves there. Recently, it is suspected that Sunni Islamist subversives have attacked other local religious groups, as well as Iraqi and American troops.

见证热水器的发展历程和泉天下的零抱怨理念（图）在中国家电制造之都广东顺德诞生的泉天下热水器，以创新思维和为客户提供零抱怨产品而著名。业界无不震撼、尊敬和推崇的是：泉天下——开创封闭式即热电热水器行业！透过具有“行业”开创意义的泉天下热水器产品，能真切地感受到产品理念——顶级、奢华、优雅与权威。封闭式即热型电热水器的诞生给消费者带来了实实在在的好处，同时也冲击了传统热水器的市场。近日，记者来到了佛山市顺德区中美丽臣电器有限公司泉天下热水器总部，就泉天下热水器的诞生过程和中国热水器的发展历程，采访了总经理邱家斌先生。“泉天下封闭式(即热型)电热水器，是针对用户抱怨设计生产的产品。热水器是一个非常特殊的产品，因为它是一个半成品，如果产品做得不够好、品牌不足够重视服务，就会立即体现在消费者的各种抱怨上。我们做产品的思维就是站在用户角度，充分考虑用户可能存在的各种抱怨，例如流量小、水温低、占用空间大、烧水时间长、不健康、不安全等等，泉天下热水器就是针对用户的这些不同的抱怨而设计生产的。”据邱总介绍，热水器一直是客户抱怨不断的产品：从燃气式热水器、储水式电热水器，到敞开式即热电热水器，尽管热水器生产厂商们一直在改进，但始终还是不能让消费者满意——解决问题的同时又会衍生出新的问题。背负“煤气杀手”的燃气热水器，因安全问题层出不穷，曾一度让消费者陷入谈气色变、毛骨悚然的境地。1999年国家出台相关政策“禁直推强”关注燃气热水器安全，安全问题有所提高，但因技术原因燃气热水器仍不尽人意。90年代传统储水式电热水器因流量大、水温高，可多路供水，在中国市场上悄然崛起。但又因体积大、占空间，外形蛮笨，加热速度慢、等待时间长，且热水不能持久水越洗越冷，内部结水垢破坏发热体存在漏电隐患等问题而让消费者苦恼。加上充斥于各大媒体的许多大品牌，漏电死亡事故的负面消息，让消费者更加心灰意冷。2000年开始，以传统敞开式即热式电热水器为代表的快速电热水器团队黑马般地杀出，弥补了传统储水式电热水器不能持久供热水、占空间、等待时间长的缺陷。但传统敞开式即热式电热水器自身存在的技术缺陷，却又让使用者苦不堪言、抱怨连天。敞开式即热式电热水器的热水流量太小、水温太低——极限水温只有55度，无法满足泡脚和洗烫的需求。夏天可以勉强使用，但冬天一来，由于自来水温度低，热水器出来的几乎是冷水，消费者根本无法正常使用。另外，敞开式即热式热水器内部不承压，无法实现洗手、洗菜、洗碗等多路供水。结构又过于敏感、小器，维修率太高，几乎没有回头客。2008年，中美丽臣电器有限公司在怨声载道的热水器路上，以消费者抱怨为突破目标，综合中国热水器近40年发展历史，认真总结各种热水器产品的优点和缺点，扬长避短、集众家所长，重磅推出了泉天下封闭式即热型电热水器——开创了封闭式即热型电热水器行业。泉天下热水器科学地运用了空气智能探测仪等多项国家专利，成为了集流量大、水温高(最高70多度)、热水源源不断、安全、小巧、美观的高品质热水器产品，同时凭借着无镁技术满足了健康的多路供水需要。产品推出之后，良好的口碑为泉天下赢得了众多回头客，真正实现了泉天下要让消费者零抱怨的目标。泉天下热水器的诞生也彻底改变了热水器40年来不安全、不健康、不好用、不美观、口碑差的行业历史，为热水器的发展开辟了新的行业领域。	邱总,邱家斌	正向	"The Quantianxia water heater, which witnessed the development of water heaters and Quantianxia's zero complaint concept (picture), was born in Shunde, the capital of home appliance manufacturing in China, and is famous for its innovative thinking and providing customers with zero complaint products. The industry is all shocked, respected and respected: Quantianxia - to create a closed namely thermoelectric water heater industry! Through the pioneering Quantianxia water heater products with ""industry"" significance, you can truly feel the product concept - top class, luxury, elegance and authority. The birth of the closed instantaneous electric water heater has brought tangible benefits to consumers, and has also impacted the market of traditional water heaters. Recently, the reporter came to the headquarters of Quantianxia Water Heater of Zhongmeilichen Electric Appliance Co., Ltd. in Shunde District, Foshan City, and interviewed Mr. Qiu Jiabin, the general manager, about the birth process of Quantianxia Water Heater and the development process of water heaters in China. ""Quantianxia closed (i.e. thermal) electric water heater is a product designed and produced in response to users' complaints. Water heater is a very special product, because it is a semi-finished product. If the product is not well done and the brand does not pay enough attention to service, it will immediately reflect on various complaints of consumers. Our product thinking is to stand in the perspective of users and fully consider all kinds of complaints that users may have, such as small flow, low water temperature, large space occupation, long water heating time, unhealthy, unsafe, etc. Quantianxia water heater is designed and produced in response to these different complaints of users."" According to President Qiu, water heaters have always been the product of customers' complaints: gas water heaters, water storage Although water heater manufacturers have been improving, However, it still cannot satisfy consumers - new problems will arise while solving problems. The gas water heater with ""gas killer"" on its back, because of the endless safety problems, once let consumers fall into the situation of pale and creepy talk. In 1999, the state issued the relevant policy of ""forbidding direct promotion"" to focus on the safety of gas water heaters, and the safety problem has been improved, but the gas water heaters are still unsatisfactory due to technical reasons. In the 1990s, the traditional water storage electric water heater quietly rose in the Chinese market because of its large flow and high water temperature, which can supply water in multiple ways. However, consumers are distressed by the problems such as large size, space occupation, bulky appearance, slow heating speed, long waiting time, and the hot water can not last long. The water gets colder and colder as it is washed, and the internal scaling damages the heater, which has potential leakage problems. In addition, the negative news of electric leakage death accidents from many major brands that are flooded with major media has made consumers more discouraged. Since 2000, the rapid electric water heater team, represented by the traditional open instantaneous electric water heater, has come out like a dark horse, making up for the defects of the traditional water storage electric water heater that cannot supply hot water permanently, takes up space and has a long waiting time. However, the technical defects of the traditional open instantaneous electric water heater itself make users suffer and complain. The hot water flow of the open instant electric water heater is too small and the water temperature is too low - the limit water temperature is only 55 degrees, which cannot meet the needs of soaking feet and washing and ironing. It can be used reluctantly in summer, but in winter, because the tap water temperature is low, the water heater is almost cold water, and consumers can not use it normally. In addition, the open instantaneous water heater is not under pressure inside, so it is impossible to realize multiple water supply such as washing hands, vegetables, dishes, etc. The structure is too sensitive and small, the maintenance rate is too high, and there are almost no repeat customers. In 2008, on the road of water heaters filled with complaints, China Meilishen Electric Appliance Co., Ltd., taking consumer complaints as a breakthrough goal, combined the nearly 40 years of development history of Chinese water heaters, carefully summarized the advantages and disadvantages of various water heater products, developed strengths and circumvented weaknesses, and combined the strengths of all families, launched the Quantianxia closed instant electric water heater - creating the closed instant electric water heater industry. Quantianxia water heater has scientifically applied a number of national patents, such as intelligent air detector, and has become a high-quality water heater product with large flow, high temperature (up to 70 degrees), continuous hot water supply, safety, small and beautiful. At the same time, it has met the needs of healthy multi-channel water supply by virtue of magnesium free technology. After the launch of the product, the good reputation has won many repeat customers for Quantianxia, which has truly achieved the goal of making consumers have no complaints. The birth of Quantianxia Water Heater has also completely changed the 40 year history of unsafe, unhealthy, unusable, ugly and bad reputation of the water heater industry, opening up a new industry field for the development of water heaters."
切尔西大将偷情上瘾艳照+色情短信戳爆谎言(图)新浪体育讯　切尔西队长特里在情人节得到了妻子托尼的原谅，“友妻门”事件似将大事化小。但他的队友阿什利-科尔就没这么好运了，情人节刚过，《太阳报》便曝光在另一位金发美女的手机里也有科尔发的色情短信和“限制级”照片，并谴责“不要脸的阿什利-科尔是个发色情短信的骗子”。上周一位28岁的无上装女模特索尼娅声称她的手机收到了科尔的“艳照”，但科尔辩解说他只是用临时性的手机给自己拍着玩的，然后忘了把照片删掉就转手给了一个朋友，后者又转手给了别人，之后别人冒充他的名义把他的不雅照发给那位女模特。科尔振振有词的坚称自己从来没有与索尼娅进行过短信“激情”，科尔的发言人也声称索尼娅手机上的科尔裸照都是一次性的。但刚刚过去几天，太阳报就找到了新的证据：几乎同样内容的科尔艳照也出现在另一位女性的手机中，此外科尔还向这位“红颜知己”发送过三百多条色情短信，而且是用同一部手机在九个月之前发的。科尔上周的弥天大谎顿时被无情戳穿。按照时间推算，科尔是在女明星妻子谢丽尔参加《X档案》电视节目的两个月拍摄期间内，向那位“红颜知己”发送那些裸照和淫秽短信的。而那位暂未公开身份的女人将这些短信和艳照都保存了下来。从科尔发给那位匿名“知己”的短信中还可以看出，科尔一直在刻意欺骗自己的妻子谢丽尔。科尔从2008年10月4日开始给这位“知己”发短信，他先是说：“我请求你把这些视为我们两人之间的秘密。”几分钟之后又发了一条：“请你把这些短信都删掉吧，要是被发现了我的‘蛋’就没了。”但初期的担心过后，科尔很快又要求那位“红颜知己”把她的裸照发给他，做为回应，科尔也给她发了七张自己的“艳照”。那些照片包括科尔只穿着白色的内裤站在浴室镜子前的自拍、他的脸部特写、还有两张明显能看出他已经勃起的露骨照片。在那之后，科尔和她继续保持着这种短信“交流”，10月9日，他再次要求她将之前的短信删掉：“我们都必须删掉这些，我确实非常信任你，我也永远不会让任何人看到这些。”不过科尔还是难以抵挡这种偷情的快感，仍然不断要求她给他发裸照。那天晚上他的一条短信写道：“我能再看一张你胸部的照片吗？求你了。”另一条则写道：“C(科尔在短信中用姓COLE的第一个字母C自称)告诉你，如果你给我发你的裸照，你就能收到我的更好的照片。”科尔的这些短信大部分都是在周五和周六发出的，那个时候谢丽尔一般不是在拍《X档案》，就是出席别的现场演出。科尔最长的一次短信“出轨”出现在2008年10月25日到26日之间，科尔一共发了57条。10月26日凌晨3点32分，科尔发送了一张自己隐私部位的照片，之后两人的短信内容就开始越来越火爆，一直到科尔的手机没电为止。10月27日，科尔还体贴的发短信问她：“在那天的短信激情后，你这两天恢复得怎么样？”值得一提的是，而在这次短信“出轨”的几个月前，22岁的美发师艾米-沃顿向《太阳报》爆料她曾与科尔有染，那之后谢丽尔在2008年的大部分时间都在努力挽救她与科尔之间的婚姻。现在无情的事实显示，当时科尔一边向谢丽尔认错，一边却仍在继续出轨，只不过是从零距离的肉体出轨变成了远程的精神出轨而已。不知道谢丽尔这次会有何反应，是像特里的妻子托尼那样大事化小？还是像科尔担心的那样，让他的“蛋”消失？对了，科尔要应付的可能还不止谢丽尔。在英国，通过手机网络发送不雅照片是一种犯罪行为，可以判处入狱六个月或者罚款5000英镑，现在证据凿凿，科尔恐怕还将面临官司的困扰。(空空)	阿什利-科尔,科尔,特里,谢丽尔,托尼,艾米-沃顿,索尼娅	负向	"Chelsea captain Terry was forgiven by his wife Tony on Valentine's Day, and the ""Friends Wife Gate"" incident seemed to make matters less serious. But his teammate Ashley Cole was not so lucky. Just after Valentine's Day, the Sun newspaper exposed that Cole also sent pornographic messages and ""restricted"" photos on another blonde's mobile phone, and condemned ""shameless Ashley Cole is a liar who sends pornographic messages"". Last week, Sonia, a 28 year old topless female model, claimed that her mobile phone had received ""erotic photos"" from Cole, but Cole argued that he only used a temporary mobile phone to take photos of himself for fun, and then forgot to delete the photos and transferred them to a friend, who then transferred them to someone else. Later, someone pretended to be his name and sent his indecent photos to the female model. Cole firmly insists that he has never had ""passion"" with Sonia via text message. Cole's spokesman also claims that the nude pictures of Cole on Sonia's mobile phone are disposable. But just in the past few days, the Sun found new evidence: Cole Yanzhao with almost the same content also appeared on another woman's mobile phone, and this surgeon also sent more than 300 pornographic messages to the ""beauty bosom friend"", which was sent nine months ago with the same mobile phone. Cole's big lie last week was immediately and ruthlessly exposed. According to the time calculation, Cole sent those nude photos and obscene text messages to the ""beauty bosom friend"" during the two month shooting period when Cheryl, the wife of the actress, participated in the ""X Files"" television program. The woman whose identity has not been disclosed has saved these messages and erotic photos. It can also be seen from the text message sent by Cole to the anonymous ""bosom friend"" that Cole has been deliberately deceiving his wife Cheryl. Cole began to send text messages to the ""bosom friend"" on October 4, 2008. First, he said: ""I ask you to regard these as secrets between us. Those photos include a self portrait of Cole standing in front of the bathroom mirror in white underpants, a close-up of his face, and two revealing photos that clearly show that he has erect. After that, Cole continued to ""communicate"" with her via text messages. On October 9, he again asked her to delete the previous text messages: ""We must delete these, I really trust you, and I will never let anyone see these."" But Cole still could not resist the pleasure of cheating, and still kept asking her to send him nude photos. One of his text messages that night wrote: ""Can I see another picture of your chest? Please."" The other wrote: ""C (Cole uses the first letter C of his surname COLE in his text message) told you that if you send me your nude picture, you will receive a better picture of me."" Most of Cole's text messages were sent on Friday and Saturday, when Cheryl was either shooting ""X Files"" or attending other live performances. Cole's longest SMS ""derailment"" occurred between October 25 and 26, 2008, with a total of 57 messages sent by Cole. At 3:32 a.m. on October 26, Cole sent a photo of his private part. After that, the text messages of the two became more and more popular until Cole's mobile phone ran out of power. On October 27, Cole also thoughtfully sent a text message to ask her: ""How have you recovered in the past two days after the passion of the text message that day?"" It is worth mentioning that several months before the text message ""cheating"", Amy Wharton, a 22-year-old hairdresser, revealed to the Sun that she had an affair with Cole. After that, Cheryl spent most of 2008 trying to save her marriage with Cole. Now the cruel facts show that when Cole confessed to Cheryl, he was still cheating, just from a zero distance physical derailment to a long-distance spiritual derailment. I don't know how Cheryl will react this time. She is like Terry's wife Tony to make things small? Or, as Cole feared, let his ""egg"" disappear? By the way, Cole may have to deal with more than Cheryl. In the UK, sending indecent photos via mobile phone network is a criminal act, which can be sentenced to six months in prison or a fine of 5000 pounds. Now that the evidence is clear, Cole is afraid that he will still face a lawsuit. (empty)"
长江证券：资金推动市场上升趋势不改从盘面上看，央行表示货币政策基调不变，释放700亿资金，基金开户数创17个月来新高和A股新增开户数逼近50万户等消息，表明政策不变，市场做多热情不改。而《关于实施金太阳示范工程的通知》出台，支持光伏发电项目，则直接带动了周三新能源板块的高开，不过随后在抛压盘的打压下，新能源板块纷纷回落。受益于国际油价的上涨和美国经济的复苏预期，石油、煤炭、有色等资源类板块周三引领大盘，再创出新高。而农药化工类强周期性板块，也受益于经济和行业周期性复苏，近期也是继续保持强势。周二表现抢眼的酿酒食品医药等板块则弱于大盘。早盘“阳包阴”的走势再次说明市场资金充裕、人气高涨的局面，市场并没有因为中国建筑的上市申购而有所影响，且出现一定程度的快速报复性反弹，个股的活跃也增添了市场维持强势的信心，大盘在短线仍有进一步震荡攀升可能。央行近日关于继续“保增长、扩内需、调结构”，坚定不移地执行适度宽松的货币政策的表态，在一定程度上消除了市场对流动性控制的顾虑，我们预计在资金的推动下，市场趋势不改，指数或有新高出现。(长江证券)		正向	"Changjiang Securities: The upward trend of the market driven by funds remains unchanged.

The issuance of the Notice on the Implementation of the Golden Sun Demonstration Project to support photovoltaic power generation projects directly led to the high opening of the new energy sector on Wednesday, but then under the pressure of the selling plate, the new energy sector fell back one after another. Benefiting from the rise of international oil prices and the expectation of the recovery of the U.S. economy, the oil, coal, nonferrous metals and other resource sectors led the market on Wednesday, hitting a new high. The strong cyclical plate of pesticide and chemical industry also benefits from the cyclical recovery of the economy and industry, and it also continues to maintain its strength in the near future. The eye-catching wine, food and medicine sectors on Tuesday were weaker than the market. The trend of ""Yang Bao Yin"" in the morning market once again shows that the market has abundant funds and high popularity. The market has not been affected by the listing and purchase of CSCEC, and there has been a rapid retaliatory rebound to a certain extent. The activity of individual stocks has also increased the confidence of the market to maintain its strength, and the market still has the possibility of further volatility and climb in the short term. The central bank's recent statement that it will continue to ""maintain growth, expand domestic demand and adjust the structure"" and unswervingly implement a moderately loose monetary policy has, to a certain extent, eliminated the market's concerns about liquidity control.

新桥功成身退平安持深发展21.44%股权完成收购每经实习记者蔡颖发自北京长达一年的“平深恋”终于“修成正果”！昨日(5月7日)，中国平安保险(集团)股份有限公司(以下简称“中国平安”)发布公告称，已完成受让新桥投资集团(以下简称“新桥投资”)5.2亿股深发展股份，这表明，中国平安集团现持有深发展股份比例已提升至21.44%，成功“坐上”深发展第一大股东的交椅。平安“晋级”最大股东该公告显示，截止至5月7日，新桥投资已经将其所持有的深发展520,414,439股股份全部过户至中国平安名下。交易双方都表示这是一次强强联合、优势互补、多方共赢的合作，对中国金融、保险业的改革创新均具有重要意义。本次过户完成之前，中国平安及其控股子公司中国平安人寿保险股份有限公司(以下简称“平安人寿”)合计持有深发展145,328,248股股份，约占深发展目前总股本3,105,433,762股的4.68%。本次过户完成之后，本次过户完成之后，中国平安及平安人寿合计持有深发展6.66亿股股份，约占深发展目前总股本的21.44%，分别为其第一、第二大股东，而进驻六年的新桥投资集团将挥手告别深发展。另据悉，截至目前，平安人寿通过非公开发行方式认购深发展股份的事项仍需其他相关监管机构的批准。新桥投资功成身退今年5月4日中国平安集团和深发展同时表示，平安将向新桥投资定向增发299，088，758股境外上市外资股，而新桥投资以其所持有的深发展520，414，439股股份作为支付对价。以中国平安H股5月7日最新收盘价每股61.1港元/股计算，业内人士分析认为，新桥将可从该笔交易中获得约183亿港元，合约160亿元，这意味着，新桥投资持有股份迅速变现并获得巨额收益。“新桥很可能将带着七倍左右的回报率功成身退，从整个平安收购深发展股份来看，新桥投资是最大的获益者。”但不可否认的是，在2005年新桥投资入主深发展后着实让深发展“焕然一新”，随后几年中，极大地降低了其坏账率。此次，平安完成对深发展的收购，深发展方面称，希望未来可以通过中国平安在保险、银行、证券的综合金融服务平台，更深、更广地拓展客户基础，并加深双方的优势互补。然而，深发展今年对于补充资本金也重任在肩。据深发展2009年年报显示，其资本充足率为8.88%，核心资本充足率为5.52%，紧逼监管红线。对此，中国平安方面表示，作为深发展第一大股东，今后将积极推进深发展定向增发项目的顺利完成，迅速提升深发展的资本实力，提高其资本充足率，增强核心竞争力。	蔡颖	正向	"Xinqiao's successful retirement and Ping An's acquisition of 21.44% of Shenzhen Development's shares were completed. Cai Ying, an intern reporter from Beijing, has finally achieved success in his one-year ""Ping Shen Love""! Yesterday (May 7), Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. of China (hereinafter referred to as ""Ping An of China"") announced that it had completed the acquisition of 520 million shares of Shenzhen Development from Xinqiao Investment Group (hereinafter referred to as ""Xinqiao Investment""), which indicates that the proportion of shares of Shenzhen Development held by Ping An of China has risen to 21.44%, successfully ""sitting"" as the largest shareholder of Shenzhen Development. Ping An ""promoted"" the largest shareholder The announcement shows that as of May 7, Xinqiao Investment has transferred all its 520414439 shares of Shenzhen Development to Ping An of China. Both sides of the transaction expressed that this is a cooperation of strong combination, complementary advantages and win-win results, which is of great significance to the reform and innovation of China's financial and insurance industries. Prior to the completion of this transfer, Ping An of China and its holding subsidiary Ping An Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Ping An Life"") held 145328248 shares of Shenzhen Development, accounting for 4.68% of the current total capital stock of 3105433762 shares of Shenzhen Development. After the completion of this transfer, Ping An and Ping An Life held 666 million shares of Shenzhen Development in total, accounting for 21.44% of the current total share capital of Shenzhen Development, and they were the first and second largest shareholders respectively. Xinqiao Investment Group, which has been stationed for six years, will wave goodbye to Shenzhen Development. It is also reported that up to now, the subscription of Shenzhen Development Shares by Ping An Life Insurance through non-public offering still needs the approval of other relevant regulatory authorities. Xinqiao Investment's successful retirement On May 4 this year, China Ping An Group and Shenzhen Development also said that Ping An would issue 299088758 overseas listed foreign shares to Xinqiao Investment, and Xinqiao Investment would pay for its 520414439 shares of Shenzhen Development. Based on the latest closing price of Ping An H shares on May 7, 61.1 Hong Kong dollars per share, industry insiders believe that Xinqiao will get about 18.3 billion Hong Kong dollars from this transaction, with a contract of 16 billion yuan, which means that the shares held by Xinqiao Investment will be realized quickly and earn huge profits. ""Xinqiao is likely to retire with a return rate of about seven times. From the perspective of the entire acquisition of Shenzhen Development shares by Ping An, Xinqiao Investment is the biggest beneficiary."" But it is undeniable that after Xinqiao Investment took the lead in Shenzhen Development in 2005, it really made Shenzhen Development ""brand new"", and in the following years, its bad debt rate was greatly reduced. This time, Ping An completed the acquisition of Shenzhen Development, and Shenzhen Development said that it hoped that in the future, through the comprehensive financial service platform of Ping An in insurance, banking and securities, it could expand the customer base deeper and wider, and deepen the complementary advantages of both sides. However, SDB also has a heavy responsibility to replenish capital this year.

老任悲催？美国800W玩家喜爱iPad胜过任天堂来自媒体及科技市场研究机构Interpret的最新调查报告显示：iPad已经成为游戏市场的一线平台，超过一半的iPad用户热衷于通过玩游戏消磨时间。该调查结果显示，在美国本土超过1140万名iPad用户中，有800万名用户在使用iPad玩游戏，其中包括大量传统玩家——传统玩家的数量甚至比非传统玩家(即休闲玩家)还要多。该调查报告售价250美元Interpret分析师JasonPreston表示：“总体来说，在iPad用户中，仍然使用家用游戏机、手机或任天堂掌机玩游戏的比例正在逐渐降低。这意味着iPad游戏开发商和发行商显然得到了一批忠实的玩家，同时也充分体现出了苹果打算将iPad打造为家庭游戏设备的野心，此外，iPad上丰富的游戏阵容显然得到了大批传统游戏玩家的青睐。”而自2002年起担任任天堂社长至今的岩田聪一直立场鲜明地反对iOS游戏平台，本周三，他在接受日本经济新闻采访时表示：“绝不考虑针对iPad或iPhone平台开发游戏，如果这么做，任天堂就不再是任天堂了。”——任天堂毕竟是一家自1977年就开始做游戏硬件平台的先驱者，不会轻易放弃自己的传统。编辑点评：老任啊，你可知道，我们当年追随你的FC一起长大的小朋友，如今都已成家立业了，而且有小朋友都很大的啦，老任是觉得我们保留着一颗童年的心吗？不了，我们喜欢可以随时随地的娱乐，iPad刚好能满足我们，什么XDS啊，WIi啊那些都是不行，连我们的小孩都渐渐不玩WIi了，老任你是不是该想想办法呢？好吧，我再等等你的WiiU吧，看看会有多大的改变。	老任,岩田聪,JasonPreston	正向	"Old Ren Beicui? The latest survey report from the media and technology market research institute Interpret of Nintendo shows that 800W players in the United States prefer the iPad to the game market. More than half of iPad users are keen on killing time by playing games. The survey results show that among the more than 11.4 million iPad users in the United States, 8 million users are using the iPad to play games, including a large number of traditional players - the number of traditional players is even more than non-traditional players (that is, casual players). Jason Preston, an Interpret analyst who sold the survey report for $250, said: ""In general, the proportion of iPad users who still play games on home consoles, mobile phones or Nintendo handheld computers is gradually decreasing. This means that iPad game developers and publishers have obviously won a group of loyal players, and it fully reflects Apple's ambition to build the iPad into a home game device. In addition, the rich game lineup on the iPad has obviously won the favor of a large number of traditional game players."" While Satoshi Iwata, who has served as the president of Nintendo since 2002, has been clearly opposed to the iOS game platform. On Wednesday, in an interview with the Japanese Economic News, he said: ""We will never consider developing games for the iPad or iPhone platform. If we do this, Nintendo will no longer be Nintendo."" - Nintendo, after all, is a pioneer of the game hardware platform since 1977, and will not easily give up its tradition. Editor's comment: Laoren, do you know that the children we grew up with your FC in the past have all got married and started their careers, and the children are very big. Does Laoren think we have a childhood heart? No, we like entertainment that can be anytime and anywhere. The iPad can just meet our needs. XDS and WIi are not good. Even our children have gradually stopped playing WIi. Old Ren, should you think of a way? Well, I'll wait for your WiiU to see how much it will change."
专家：克林顿访朝标志美朝会谈只是时间问题克林顿访朝背后无论美国政府如何表态，克林顿与金正日的会面，都标志着双方直接会谈只是时间问题了。撰稿·邵乐韵(记者)8月5日，被朝鲜羁押了140天的美籍女记者凌志美和李丽娜，在走下克林顿专机的舷梯后，终于踏上了洛杉矶的土地，与久别的家人相拥而泣。克林顿的20小时旋风之旅无疑给两个家庭和整个美国带来了极大振奋。正在肯尼亚访问的希拉里听闻女记者获释，感到“无比兴奋”；总统奥巴马则“大大松了口气”。在朝鲜平壤，一张克林顿和朝鲜最高领导人金正日的合照迅速出现在媒体显要位置。两人合照的背景是百花园国宾馆著名的“海浪”油画，惊涛拍岸，气势磅礴。在美国人看来，这可能就是一幅装饰画；但对朝鲜人来说，“海浪”象征着朝鲜勇敢面对外国力量挑战的决心。然而，双方真的皆大欢喜了吗？以私人身份出访朝鲜的克林顿仅仅是去救女记者的吗？僵持了将近半年的朝美关系是否就此趋于缓和？只救记者，未谈朝核？比尔·克林顿是金正日“点名”出马的。就在克林顿成行前两周，朝鲜外务省发言人还和克林顿的妻子、美国国务卿希拉里打过一场“口水仗”，朝美关系一点没有软化的迹象。此前，希拉里也曾提出若干赴朝斡旋人选，其中包括两名女记者所属“潮流”电台的联合创办人、前副总统戈尔，但均被朝鲜方面回绝。7月中旬，朝鲜让两名记者与家人通话时传达了让克林顿担任特使的建议。戈尔马上打电话给克林顿，请他务必跑一趟；白宫也询问克林顿，是否愿意出马。克林顿与妻子商量后，终于8月4日展开了这场“纯人道主义性质的私人访问”。自从为妻子助选美国总统结束后，在新闻上鲜有露脸的克林顿一下子成了美国的“高级外交官”。其实，克林顿的“朝鲜半岛缘”可以追溯到10年前。这也是朝鲜对他存有好感的缘由之一。当时，朝美正处于谈判胶着状态，美国要求朝鲜停止一切与弹道导弹有关的活动，作为回报，朝鲜可以得到全面外交认可，美国和日本提供的数十亿美元援助，以及美国总统克林顿的亲临访问。时任克林顿政府对朝鲜调停官的温蒂·舍曼回忆说，金正日就是希望克林顿能出访朝鲜，让美国做出对朝鲜的安全保障承诺。2000年10月，克林顿与朝鲜国防委员会第一副委员长赵明录次帅在华盛顿进行了秘密会晤，赵转达了金正日发出的邀请。一周后，国务卿奥尔布赖特抵达朝鲜，为克林顿访朝探路。舍曼记得，当时金正日对奥尔布赖特说：“(1998年试射的)大浦洞1号是发射的第一枚导弹，也将是最后一枚。”但后来，由于种种原因，总统任期末的克林顿终究没有实现朝鲜之行。而几个月后，小布什上台，切断了所有与朝鲜的外交途径，朝美关系急转直下。对于金正日来说，克林顿的到访依然是重要的时刻，这是他期待许久的会面。朝鲜主管外交事务的第一外务次官姜锡柱是金正日最信赖的朝美关系顾问，8月4日当天也参与了克林顿与金正日的会晤。当晚，朝鲜国防委员会在平壤百花园迎宾馆为克林顿举行了欢迎晚宴。朝鲜中央电视台报道说，晚宴在“亲切的气氛中”进行。从电视画面看，略显消瘦的金正日身着经常穿的黄色夹克套装，精神很好，与克林顿谈话时，右手大幅度地使用手势。外界纷纷揣测，在克林顿“私人性质”解救女记者的背后，朝美不可能不提到一个关键问题：朝核。1994年，朝美第一次因核问题严重对立，6月15日，前总统卡特代表克林顿政府访问平壤，使美朝关系由敌对转向对话，当时白宫也把卡特的访问归为私人性质。但是，美国白宫和国务院始终否认克林顿此行与金正日商谈了朝核问题。白宫发言人吉布斯对媒体的一再追问表示无可奉告，以确保克林顿的解救行动不受干扰。而克林顿政府时期负责同朝鲜谈判的罗伯特·加卢奇却认为，克林顿在任时对朝核问题很有研究，他说：“如果克林顿和金正日没有就核问题进行某种实质性的讨论，那就有点令人惊讶了。”“显然，美国政府故意强调克林顿访问朝鲜完全是私人性质：他坐的是私人飞机，也没有美国现政府官员的陪同(与克林顿同行的是克林顿政府时期担任白宫幕僚长的约翰·伯德斯塔，长期担任克林顿私人助手的道格拉斯·邦德，以及克林顿基金会的工作人员)。所以，从严格角度上讲，他是没有其他外交任务在身的。”俄籍朝鲜问题专家、《韩国时报》专栏作家安德烈·兰科夫向《新民周刊》分析说，“不过，访问朝鲜本身具有标志性意义，也可被视作是韩美双边接触的开始。不用说，这是朝鲜政府的一次重大胜利，尽管他们没有得到任何外交优惠政策，克林顿的访问还是加强了双方之间的信任。从朝鲜来说，会在官方宣传中形容这是‘美帝主义的又一次投降’，并且强调这次访问再次表明朝鲜领导人是多么有威严受尊重，同时也向外界传递了金正日身体状况良好的信息。”但是，对于克林顿访朝的细节，朝美两方各有一套说辞。奥巴马是否托克林顿带了口信？朝鲜方面称，克林顿向金正日转达了美国总统奥巴马的口信，金正日对此表示感谢并欢迎克林顿访问朝鲜。白宫方面坚决否认。但资深朝核问题专家、复旦大学美国研究中心主任沈丁立则认为，克林顿肯定带了口信去，至于白宫方面的否认，实则在和朝鲜唱双簧。至于会谈内容，朝方说金正日和克林顿“就共同关心的问题广泛交换了意见”，欲说还休，让人浮想联翩；而克林顿事后说：“我有向美国政府汇报的义务，但对政府政策哪怕有一点影响的事情，我都不会说。我已经不再是一个政策制定者了。不会再对任何事情做出评论。”双边对话VS六方会谈在7月初连续试验了几枚短程导弹后，朝鲜没有再做出任何“挑衅行为”。观察人士认为，这是有意为同美国展开对话作铺垫。最近几周，朝鲜一直在暗示希望和美国进行双边对话，而美国方面始终坚持对话应当在六方会谈框架下展开。克林顿的成功访问，能否让朝鲜借女记者这张“牌”，如愿以偿地和美国直接展开双边对话？分析人士认为，克林顿访问确实改变了朝鲜核边缘政策的紧绷状态，也为两国恢复谈判提供了可能。但短期看，实现直接对话不太可能。接下来是新开始还是外交争端的转折，尚不明朗。8月5日，身在肯尼亚的美国国务卿希拉里表示，朝鲜释放美国记者的行为与核谈问题无关，她还重申了美国呼吁朝鲜重回六方会谈的立场，并且否认丈夫克林顿以“道歉”换“特赦”：“我们一直认为这件事与让朝鲜重新回到谈判桌是截然不同的两件事。”她说，“我们与朝鲜未来的关系确实取决于他们。他们有选择。”她认为，朝鲜要么执迷不悟地挑衅下去，要么打定主意回到六方会谈谈判桌。美国总统奥巴马在接受MSNBC电视访谈中，态度更加明确：“我们已经向朝鲜指出，改善关系的道路确实有一条，那就是他们停止发展核武器，并且不再有挑衅意味的举动。”不过，韩国《朝鲜日报》的分析称：“无论美国政府如何表态，克林顿与金正日的会面，都标志着双方直接会谈只是时间问题了。”兰科夫教授说：“在我看来，这就是朝鲜惯用的外交风格：如果他们需要更多援助或优惠政策了，首先会做一些反应激烈的事情来制造危机感，同时退出所有谈判。然后当紧张程度够高的时候，他们就提出重启对话。在对话中，他们会要求得到政治或资金回报，作为愿意回到谈判桌上的回报。我们对这种策略已经习以为常。话又说回来，这些策略通常又行之有效，平壤最终总是能得到它想要的。”兰科夫还说，朝鲜之所以青睐双边对话，因为“朝鲜外交官总是善于利用周边力量之间的矛盾”。“他们在这场外交游戏中很有一套。六方会谈对他们来说是个很不利的选择，因为它把朝鲜周边的国家都联系了起来。因此，朝鲜更倾向双边对话，单独和美国谈，和韩国谈，和中国谈。这样，他们就有许多机会在其他五国之间‘玩’得游刃有余。”奥巴马政府内的一名高级顾问在接受《纽约时报》采访时表示，现在是打破朝鲜“核试验—谈判—索求回报—毁约—核试验”的恶性循环的时候了。这名顾问称，现在他们正逐渐把对朝策略重点从“减少全面开战可能性”，转向传统的“遏制策略”；阻断朝鲜向其他国家提供制导弹技术的途径。华盛顿里不会有人承认——至少书面不会承认——“遏制”是接下来的首要手段，官方说法还是布什政府提出的“完全、可验证、不可逆的弃核”原则，但是已经和朝鲜政府有过20年打交道的老外交家们心里清楚，朝鲜永远不会真正同意弃核。所以，现实可行的办法，就是阻断朝鲜政府向别国提供与核有关的技术以获取资金和能源的途径。虽然克林顿成功地带回了女记者，但是有人担心，克林顿此行可能为奥巴马政府要朝鲜放弃核武的努力带来新的风险，并让平壤觉得采取强硬政策也能获得回报。釜山东西大学的朝鲜问题专家B.R。米尔斯说：“这正中朝鲜的心意。”美国传统基金会的朝鲜专家克林纳也说：“韩国和日本都非常担心，奥巴马最终将摒弃要朝鲜放弃核武的政策，而愿意降低标准，只是防止朝鲜在未来进行核扩散。”对此，中国社科院美国研究所研究员陶文钊的意见是：不可能。“美国不可能在朝核问题上对朝鲜松口，朝美关系也不可能马上就好转。”■	道格拉斯·邦德,奥巴马,邵乐韵,米尔斯,沈丁立,比尔·克林顿,希拉里,舍曼,姜锡柱,陶文钊,克林顿,温蒂·舍曼,吉布斯,小布什,金正日,赵转达,安德烈·兰科夫,戈尔,奥尔布赖特,兰科夫,李丽娜,凌志美,克林纳,罗伯特·加卢奇,约翰·伯德斯塔,卡特,赵明录	正向	"Expert: Clinton's visit to the DPRK indicates that the US DPRK talks are just a matter of time. No matter what the US government says behind Clinton's visit to the DPRK, the meeting between Clinton and Kim Jong Il indicates that the direct talks between the two sides are just a matter of time. Writer Shao Leyun (reporter) On August 5, American female journalists Ling Zhimei and Li Lina, who had been detained by North Korea for 140 days, walked down the gangway of Clinton's special plane and finally stepped onto the land of Los Angeles, hugging and crying with their long lost families. Clinton's 20 hour whirlwind trip undoubtedly brought great excitement to the two families and the whole United States. Hillary Clinton, who was visiting Kenya, was ""extremely excited"" when she heard that the female journalist was released; President Obama was ""greatly relieved"". In Pyongyang, North Korea, a group photo of Clinton and North Korea's top leader Kim Jong Il quickly appeared in a prominent position in the media. The background of the group photo is the famous ""Ocean Wave"" oil painting of Baihuayuan National Hotel. In the eyes of Americans, this may be a decorative painting; But for North Koreans, the ""waves"" symbolize North Korea's determination to face the challenges of foreign forces bravely. However, are both sides really happy? Did Clinton, who was visiting North Korea in a private capacity, just save women journalists? Has the stalemate between the DPRK and the US for nearly half a year been eased? Only save journalists, not talk about the Korean nuclear issue? Bill Clinton was named by Kim Jong Il. Just two weeks before Clinton's trip, the spokesman of the Korean Foreign Ministry also had a ""war of words"" with Clinton's wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of the United States. There was no sign of softening relations between the DPRK and the United States. Earlier, Hillary Clinton had also proposed several candidates for mediation in the DPRK, including Al Gore, the co founder and former vice president of the ""Trend"" radio station affiliated to two women journalists, but they were rejected by the DPRK. In mid July, the DPRK sent the proposal of Clinton as the special envoy to two journalists when they talked to their families. Gore immediately called Clinton and asked him to make sure he went there; The White House also asked Clinton if he was willing to take the initiative. After discussing with his wife, Clinton finally launched this ""purely humanitarian private visit"" on August 4. Since the end of campaigning for President of the United States for his wife, Clinton, who rarely appeared in the news, has suddenly become a ""senior diplomat"" of the United States. In fact, Clinton's ""Korean Peninsula Rim"" can be traced back to 10 years ago. This is one of the reasons why North Korea likes him. At that time, North Korea and the United States were in a state of stalemate negotiations. The United States asked North Korea to stop all activities related to ballistic missiles. In return, North Korea could receive full diplomatic recognition, billions of dollars of assistance from the United States and Japan, and the personal visit of President Clinton of the United States. Wendy Sherman, the then Clinton administration's mediator to North Korea, recalled that Kim Jong Il wanted Clinton to visit North Korea and let the United States make a security commitment to North Korea. In October 2000, Clinton had a secret meeting with the First Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission of the DPRK, Zhao Minglu, Second Shuai, in Washington. Zhao conveyed the invitation from Kim Jong Il. A week later, Secretary of State Albright arrived in North Korea to explore the way for Clinton's visit. Sherman remembers that Kim Jong Il said to Albright at that time: ""The Taepodong 1 (test launched in 1998) is the first missile launched and will be the last."" But later, for various reasons, Clinton, who was at the end of his presidency, did not realize his trip to North Korea after all. A few months later, when George W. Bush came to power, he cut off all diplomatic channels with the DPRK, and the DPRK US relations went down sharply. For Kim Jong Il, Clinton's visit is still an important moment, which is the meeting he has been looking forward to for a long time. Jiang Xizhu, North Korea's first undersecretary for foreign affairs, is Kim Jong Il's most trusted adviser on North Korea US relations. He also participated in the meeting between Clinton and Kim Jong Il on August 4. That night, the Korean National Defense Commission held a welcome dinner for Clinton at the Baihuayuan Guest House in Pyongyang. North Korean Central Television reported that the dinner was held in a ""cordial atmosphere"". Seen from the TV screen, the slightly emaciated Kim Jong Il was wearing a yellow jacket suit that he often wore. He was in good spirits. When talking with Clinton, his right hand made a big gesture. The outside world has speculated that behind Clinton's ""private"" rescue of female journalists, the DPRK and the US cannot fail to mention a key issue: the DPRK nuclear issue. In 1994, North Korea and the United States were seriously opposed for the first time due to the nuclear issue. On June 15, former President Carter visited Pyongyang on behalf of the Clinton administration, turning US DPRK relations from hostility to dialogue. At that time, the White House also classified Carter's visit as private. However, the White House and the State Department of the United States have always denied that Clinton talked with Kim Jong Il about the Korean nuclear issue during his visit. White House spokesman Gibbs has no comment on the repeated questioning of the media to ensure that Clinton's rescue operation is not disturbed. Robert Gallucci, who was in charge of negotiations with North Korea during the Clinton administration, believed that Clinton had studied the North Korean nuclear issue well during his tenure, and said, ""It would be a bit surprising if Clinton and Kim Jong Il did not have some substantive discussion on the nuclear issue."" ""Obviously, the U.S. government deliberately stressed that Clinton's visit to North Korea was purely private: he was in a private plane, and was not accompanied by officials of the current U.S. government (with Clinton, John Berdsta, who served as the chief of staff of the White House during the Clinton administration, Douglas Bond, a long-term personal assistant of Clinton, and staff of the Clinton Foundation). So, strictly speaking, he did not have other diplomatic missions. In person."" Russian expert on North Korea, Korea Times Andrei Lankov, a columnist, told Xinmin Weekly that ""however, the visit to North Korea itself is symbolic and can also be seen as the beginning of bilateral contacts between South Korea and the United States. Needless to say, it is a major victory for the North Korean government. Although they did not receive any preferential foreign policy, Clinton's visit has strengthened the trust between the two sides. As for North Korea, it will describe it as"" another surrender of American imperialism ""in official propaganda, and emphasize that this visit once again shows how dignified and respected the North Korean leader is, and it also conveys to the outside world the message that Kim Jong Il is in good health."" However, for the details of Clinton's visit to North Korea, both the North Korea and the United States have a set of rhetoric. Did Obama take a message from Tokelington? North Korea said that Clinton conveyed a message from US President Barack Obama to Kim Jong Il, for which Kim Jong Il expressed gratitude and welcomed Clinton's visit to North Korea. The White House strongly denied it. However, Shen Dingli, a senior expert on the Korean nuclear issue and director of the American Research Center of Fudan University, believes that Clinton must have taken a message. As for the denial by the White House, it is actually a double act with North Korea. As for the content of the talks, the North Korean side said that Kim Jong Il and Clinton ""exchanged extensive views on issues of common concern"". It is tempting to indulge in speculation; Clinton later said: ""I have the obligation to report to the U.S. government, but I will not say anything that has any impact on the government's policies. I am no longer a policy maker. I will not comment on anything."" After the bilateral dialogue versus the six-party talks tested several short-range missiles in a row in early July, the DPRK did not make any ""provocative behavior"". Observers believe that this is intended to pave the way for dialogue with the United States. In recent weeks, North Korea has been suggesting that it hopes to have bilateral dialogue with the United States, while the United States has always insisted that the dialogue should be carried out within the framework of the six-party talks. Could Clinton's successful visit allow North Korea to borrow the ""card"" of female journalists to directly engage in bilateral dialogue with the United States? Analysts believe that Clinton's visit has indeed changed the tense state of North Korea's nuclear brinkmanship policy, and has also made it possible for the two countries to resume negotiations. But in the short term, direct dialogue is unlikely. It is not clear whether the next step is a new beginning or a turning point in the diplomatic dispute. On August 5, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was in Kenya, said that North Korea's release of US journalists had nothing to do with the nuclear talks. She also reiterated the US position calling on North Korea to return to the six-party talks, and denied that her husband Clinton had exchanged ""apology"" for ""amnesty"": ""We always thought that this matter was totally different from bringing North Korea back to the negotiating table."" She said, ""Our future relationship with North Korea really depends on them. They have choices."" She believed that North Korea either stubbornly provoked or decided to return to the six-party talks. In an interview with MSNBC television, US President Obama was more explicit: ""We have pointed out to the DPRK that there is indeed a way to improve relations, that is, they stop developing nuclear weapons and no longer act provocatively."" However, according to the analysis of the Korean Daily News, ""no matter what the US government says, the meeting between Clinton and Kim Jong Il marks that the direct talks between the two sides are just a matter of time."" Professor Lankov said: ""In my opinion, this is the usual diplomatic style of the DPRK: if they need more aid or preferential policies, they will first do something drastic to create a sense of crisis and withdraw from all negotiations. Then when the tension is high enough, They proposed to restart the dialogue. During the dialogue, they will ask for political or financial returns as a return to the negotiating table. We are used to this strategy. In other words, these strategies are usually effective, and Pyongyang will always get what it wants in the end. "" Lankov also said that the reason why North Korea favors bilateral dialogue is that ""North Korean diplomats are always good at making use of the contradictions between neighboring forces"". ""They have a lot of skills in this diplomatic game. The six-party talks are a very bad choice for them, because it links the countries around North Korea. Therefore, North Korea prefers bilateral dialogue, talking to the United States alone, talking to South Korea, and talking to China. In this way, they will have many opportunities to 'play' well among the other five countries."" A senior adviser in the Obama administration said in an interview with the New York Times that it is time to break the vicious circle of North Korea's ""nuclear test - negotiation - demanding return - breaking the contract - nuclear test"". The consultant said that now they are gradually shifting the focus of their strategy towards North Korea from ""reducing the possibility of full-scale war"" to the traditional ""containment strategy""; Blocking the way for North Korea to provide missile manufacturing technology to other countries. No one in Washington will admit - at least not in writing - that ""containment"" is the next primary means. Officially, it is still the principle of ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization"" proposed by the Bush administration. However, old diplomats who have had dealings with the North Korean government for 20 years know that North Korea will never really agree to denuclearization. Therefore, the realistic and feasible way is to block the way for the DPRK government to provide other countries with nuclear related technology to obtain funds and energy. Although Clinton successfully brought back women journalists, some people worry that Clinton's visit may bring new risks to the Obama administration's efforts to get North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, and make Pyongyang feel that tough policies can also be rewarded. B., an expert on North Korea at Pusan Dongxi University R。 Mills said, ""This is exactly what North Korea wants."" Kliner, a North Korea expert from the American Heritage Foundation, also said, ""South Korea and Japan are very worried that Obama will finally abandon the policy of asking North Korea to give up nuclear weapons, and is willing to lower standards, just to prevent North Korea from nuclear proliferation in the future."" In this regard, Tao Wenzhao, a researcher at the American Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: ""Impossible."". ""It is impossible for the United States to relax on the Korean nuclear issue, and the DPRK US relations cannot be improved immediately."" ■"

In the case of a large decline in Hong Kong shares, yesterday's A-share market closed with a small rise. Individual stocks generally rose significantly, and the performance of indicator stocks was poor, indicating that the enthusiasm for long is high, and the future market is expected to continue to fluctuate and rise. (Zheshang Securities) Today, it will attack the first trading day of the Year of the Ox. The stock index basically runs above the 5-day moving average, still supporting the market to rise. As a whole, the current market is relatively strong. Many parties gradually tend to take the initiative. Today, they will continue to rise and attack the line for half a year (2070 points). (Huarong Securities) There is still room for rebound in the short term. Technically, the moving average system forms a multi headed arrangement, forming an upward divergence trend. It is expected that the short-term index will still have room for rebound after being digested by shocks. (Guoyuan Securities) should still control the position in the near future. Although the market started well on the first trading day of the New Year, the weakness of the U.S. stock market still has a certain effect on the A-share market. It is suggested that investors should be cautious in their operations. Some stocks with large increases should not follow up, and the position should be controlled first. (Lianxun Securities) There will still be repeated slight rise of the stock index yesterday near 2000 o'clock, but the individual stock market is very exciting, showing a pattern of general rise. At present, due to the influence of weighted stocks, the space for index fluctuation will not be too large, and the future market will still be repeatedly contested around 2000 points. (Huatai Securities) On the first trading day of the Year of Ox, both Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets started well. At present, the structural market is maintaining the volatile pattern of the stock market. Investors need not worry too much about the current market. They can be more bullish and more active in participating. (Donghai Securities) The long short power tends to be balanced. In the context of the current short-term balance between the long short sides, the market has been mainly stable in recent days, the index will not rise too much, and there is an obvious opportunity for individual stocks to rotate. It is suggested that investors should pay attention to the trend of index stocks. A considerable number of individual stocks are under adjustment pressure, and short-term adjustment risks cannot be avoided. (CITIC Jintong Securities) The Year of the Ox started well again and again yesterday. The rise and fall of individual stocks shows that the market has formed a pleasant picture of general growth, but the trading volume is still slightly insufficient, and the star line has added short-term variables to some extent. Although the strong operation pattern will not be reversed, the possibility of shifting to the consolidation pattern is further increasing in recent days. (Beijing Capital Stock Exchange) The market still has room to rise. Since there is no big fluctuation in the surrounding markets during the long holiday, some wait-and-see funds will choose to enter the market. After the festival, the market may face a pattern of phased inflows of funds. Therefore, the future market is promising. (Hangzhou New Hope)

赌王分身家再起波折澳娱股权归属未定李隽澳门赌王何鸿?千亿身家如何分本周再次上演一波三折的剧码。1月26日中午1点，何鸿?在电视露面，确认他将其所持澳门旅游娱乐有限公司(下称“澳娱”)的股份近乎全部转让给其二房和三房家庭成员控股的公司，和澳博控股(00880.HK)(澳娱持有澳博控股55.7%股权)24日的公告一致，并表示其家庭内部的所有纠纷已解决，解雇其代表律师高国峻(GordonOldham)。正当外界认为此闹剧将结束之际，香港《信报》报道，1月26日当晚，何鸿?已经录下了另一短片，当中声明并未解雇高国峻，并且再次反口称二房和三房为“抢劫”；另外27日也有媒体报道，高国峻已代表何鸿?向高等法院控告二房、三房并追回股权。何鸿?过去数日风尘仆仆，频繁往来几房太太住所，并分别和二房、三房、四房太太蓝琼缨、陈婉珍、梁安琪，以及其子女会面。1月27日，NOWTV援引高国峻的话称，何鸿?1月26日中午1点在电视上读出的声明，是迫于二房和三房两方的压力。1月26日，英国《金融时报》引述高国峻的话称，持有赌王要求代为追回财产的录像片段，录像时间为1月25日早上，何鸿?对着镜头表示“帮我追回(Getmeback)”。对于上述录影片的内容，连日来保持沉默的澳博控股执行董事、何鸿?的四太太梁安琪表示，这是律师之间的事务，不便回应。《信报》报道，26日下午4点30分，高国峻到何鸿?大宅，15分钟后离开；之后高国峻表示，仍然获得何鸿?委任，并将继续代表何鸿?在澳博控股、澳娱及全资持有澳娱股权的Lanceford公司的权益。《华尔街日报》1月27日报道，何鸿?1月26日已向香港高等法院起诉家庭成员，诉讼书显示，何鸿?希望法院能够驳回现有股份分配局面，并重新调整家庭成员所持Lanceford股份的比例，何鸿?已在上述诉讼书上签字；《星岛日报》则报道，高国峻已代表赌王入禀高等法院，控告家族成员，包括二房女儿何超琼、何超凤及三太陈婉珍等合共11人，要求改动Lanceford的股权。尽管多家外资投资银行发布研究报告，称上述事件对澳博控股日常营运影响甚微，澳博控股基本面向好，然而澳博控股昨日再跌3.05%，报收12.72港元，过去一周累计跌15.2%。高盛认为，相信最终控股权仍会落在何氏家族手上，事件对澳博自身影响较低；德银表示，何鸿?拟向家族成员转让澳博控股母公司股权，虽然短期会造成市场的不明朗因素，因市场关注未来澳博大股东的控制权，但相信澳博控股将于3月底与股东进行沟通，相信不会影响澳博营运，公司基本面仍然强劲。有学者认为，香港上市公司中有不少家族式经营的企业；澳博控股的股权风波正好提醒投资者，投资这类公司时，要留意股权交接的有关风险，随着时代变迁，家族式经营企业的股权问题会越来越多。	陈婉珍,李隽,何氏,梁安琪,蓝琼缨,何超琼,高国峻,何鸿,何超凤	正向	"The separate family of gambling king rises again, and the equity ownership of Macao Entertainment is undetermined. Li Jun, the gambling king of Macao, and He Hong? How to divide a hundred billion people's wealth into three twists and turns this week. At 1 o'clock on January 26, He Hong? In his TV appearance, he confirmed that he had transferred almost all of his shares in Macao Tourism and Entertainment Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as ""Macao Entertainment"") to the company controlled by his second and third room family members, which was consistent with the announcement of Aobo Holdings (00880. HK) (Macao Entertainment holds 55.7% of the equity of Aobo Holdings) on the 24th, and said that all disputes within his family had been resolved, and his lawyer Gordon Oldham was dismissed. Just when the outside world thought that this farce would end, the Hong Kong ""Letter"" reported that on the night of January 26, He Hong? Another short film has been recorded, which states that Gao Guojun has not been dismissed, and once again calls the second and third rooms ""robbery""; On the 27th, the media also reported that Gao Guojun had represented He Hong? He sued Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the High Court and recovered his equity. He Hong? In the past few days, I have been very dusty. I frequently went to the residence of several wives and met with Lan Qiongying, Chen Wanzhen, Liang Anqi and their children respectively. On January 27, NOWTV quoted Gao Guojun as saying, He Hong? The statement read out on TV at 1 o'clock on January 26 was under the pressure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On January 26, the Financial Times quoted Gao Guojun as saying that the video clip holding the gambling king's request to recover the property was recorded in the morning of January 25. He Hong? Say ""Getmeback"" to the camera. He Hong, the executive director of SJM Holdings, who has kept silent for several days about the content of the above video recording? Liang Anqi, our fourth wife, said that this is a matter between lawyers and it is inconvenient to respond. The Letter reported that Gao Guojun arrived at He Hong at 4:30 p.m. on the 26th? Big house, leave in 15 minutes; Later, Gao Guojun said that he still won He Hong? And will continue to represent He Hong? Interests in SJM Holdings, SJM Entertainment and Lanceford, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SJM Entertainment. The Wall Street Journal reported on January 27 that He Hong? On January 26, family members have been sued in the High Court of Hong Kong. According to the lawsuit, He Hong? I hope the court can reject the existing share distribution situation and readjust the proportion of Lanceford shares held by family members. He Hong? Has signed the above-mentioned lawsuit; The Sing Tao Daily reported that Gao Guojun had filed a complaint with the High Court on behalf of the gambling king, accusing family members, including He Chaoqiong, He Chaofeng, the daughter of the second wife, and Chen Wanzhen, the third wife, and a total of 11 people, to change Lanceford's equity. Although a number of foreign investment banks released research reports, saying that the above events had little impact on the daily operations of SJM Holdings, SJM Holdings basically faced a good situation. However, SJM Holdings fell another 3.05% yesterday, closing at HK $12.72, a cumulative decline of 15.2% in the past week. Goldman Sachs believes that it is believed that the ultimate control will still fall in the hands of the He family, and the event has a low impact on SJM itself; Deutsche Bank said, He Hong? It is proposed to transfer the equity of the parent company of SJM Holdings to family members. Although it will cause uncertainty in the market in the short term, as the market focuses on the control rights of major shareholders of SJM in the future, it is believed that SJM Holdings will communicate with shareholders at the end of March, and it is believed that it will not affect the operation of SJM, and the company's fundamentals are still strong. Some scholars believe that there are many family run enterprises in Hong Kong listed companies; The equity crisis of SJM Holdings just reminds investors that when investing in such companies, they should pay attention to the risks related to equity handover. With the change of times, the equity problems of family run enterprises will become more and more."

When Andy Lau appeared, the three tough guys rushed forward and sandwiched Andy Lau in the middle. When the author came forward to take photos, the tough guy kept blocking the camera with his hands, which was very rude.

On this trip to Beijing, there were three bodyguards in black who accompanied Andy Lau. Seeing that the scene was going to be chaotic, the bodyguards hurried forward to separate the fans including the author from Andy Lau. Taking advantage of the chaos, the author squeezed out the crowd to ask Andy Lau again For the purpose of coming to Beijing, Liu Dehua just smiled slightly and kept silent. The assistant beside him hurried to deal with the author and said, ""We are in a hurry, thank you!"" When the author followed the escalator, Liu Dehua's assistant stopped the author, Andy Lau and his party hurried away from the upper channel. Andy Lau's ""real person"" has just left, and the fans around him seem to be not satisfied. They ask the author, ""Have you got it? Can we have a look? Can you give me some pictures?"" It seems that the popularity of Andy Lau is still No. 1 in the entertainment industry. That night, the author asked several colleagues, but they did not know the purpose of Andy Lau's visit to Beijing. There was no public trip for him in the next two days, which could not help but remind people of the report by the Hong Kong media last week that Andy Lau would accompany Zhu Liqian, the ""shadow lover"" who has lived behind the scenes for many years, to watch the Olympic Games in Beijing. For this reason, many Hong Kong media have come to Beijing to look for and wait for him. This time, he appeared mysteriously in Beijing again. Is it possible that such rumors are not groundless, or is it possible that he really broke through many obstacles to have a romantic summer in Beijing with Zhu Liqian?

洗盘之后还将继续演绎上涨行情余炜看了今天上午这个盘面，你有没有感觉到一种莫名的恐怖？如果没有，并且你是重仓持股操作的投资朋友，那我余炜恭喜你，你的投资心态和投资技术已经完全凌驾于整个市场。在今天中午吃饭的时候，一位老客户直接拨通我座机，问行情是不是到头了。在电话中我就能够感受到他焦虑不安的心态，和即将被洗盘洗出局的危险状态。在此，我重申昨日表述的观点，大盘短期内选择2800点处搭建小平台，洗盘之后还将继续演绎上涨行情，重点关注滞涨的周期性板块，其中券商股是全市场首选品种。回看今天早盘煤炭和有色两大板块，其作为前期龙头品种在整体回撤的背景下，主力也借机展开对市场的强力洗盘，这从盘面上我们能清晰的看到开滦股份逐级下跌，铜陵有色低位放水，而笔者重点指出的滞涨周期性股也纷纷选择下海“游泳”。这个时候市场就像给每位投资者出考题，你到底是放弃持股，还是继续持股不动？和近日来的高考一样，有些“考生”在困难面前选择退缩，而意志坚定者则将迎接美好的未来。再看一下今天午后的市场表现，西南证券坐上头把交椅并且以涨停板来报收，海通证券则继续演绎其“二当家”风采，以7%的涨幅紧贴在西南证券身后，其余各券商股也用自身的靓丽表现，来回馈所有“坚定”持股者。笔者每天在这里与投资朋友交流行情，与投资朋友交谈心得，其目的只有一个，那就是把自己的观点呈现在大众面前，接受市场的检阅，接受市场的考评。6月份以来，我不仅指出市场机会在哪，也将市场风险在哪一并提示给大家。券商股，我想只要关注过余炜节目的投资朋友，一定都会知道，这是我6月份最看好的盈利机会板块。同样，我也指出像紫金矿业这类大非减持股的市场风险，看看近期该股成交量的变化状况，结合笔者带给大家的行业内消息，我想市场老手们大多已经能明白它之后想干嘛了。市场有机会，同样市场也有风险，这就看你怎么去把握了！	余炜	正向	"After washing the dish, we will continue to interpret the rising market. Yu Wei saw this dish this morning. Did you feel a kind of inexplicable terror? If not, and you are an investment friend of the heavy position holding operation, I congratulate you, Yu Wei. Your investment mentality and investment technology have completely exceeded the whole market. At lunch today, an old customer dialed my landline directly and asked if the market was over. On the phone, I could feel his anxiety and the danger of being washed out. Here, I would like to reiterate the view expressed yesterday that the market will choose 2800 points to build a small platform in the short term. After the washing, it will continue to interpret the rising market, focusing on the cyclical sector of stagflation, in which securities companies are the first choice in the market. Looking back at the two major plates of coal and nonferrous metals in the morning trading today, as the leading varieties in the early stage, under the background of overall withdrawal, the main force also took the opportunity to carry out a strong market washing. From the plate, we can clearly see that Kailuan shares are falling gradually, Tongling nonferrous metals is releasing water at a low level, and the stagflation cyclical stocks highlighted by the author have also chosen to ""swim"" in the sea. At this time, the market is like giving each investor an examination question. Do you want to give up or continue to hold shares? Like the recent college entrance examination, some ""examinees"" choose to retreat in the face of difficulties, while those who are determined will welcome a better future. Looking at the market performance this afternoon, Southwest Securities took the top position and closed on the price limit board. Haitong Securities continued to play its ""second in command"" style, closely following Southwest Securities with a 7% increase. Other securities companies also used their own beautiful performance to feed back all ""firm"" shareholders. The author exchanges quotations and experiences with investment friends here every day for one purpose, that is, to present his views to the public, to accept the review and evaluation of the market. Since June, I have not only pointed out where the market opportunities are, but also pointed out where the market risks are. I think anyone who has followed Yu Wei's program will know that this is my most promising profit opportunity in June. Similarly, I also pointed out the market risk of non tradable shares such as Zijin Mining. Looking at the recent changes in the trading volume of the stock, combined with the industry news I brought to you, I think most of the market veterans can understand what they want to do later. There are both opportunities and risks in the market, which depends on how you grasp them!"
美剧织“围脖”搞创作73岁微博老爸走红荧屏文/小托CBS在2010年做了一个“艰难的决定”，他们尝试将美国某热门微博(http://t.sina.com.cn)上的流行语、小笑话和逗笑噱头改编成一部情景喜剧，名为《老爸说脏话》，并在秋季档全面热播。古怪老头取材微博《老爸说脏话》由老版《星际迷航》中的舰长威廉·夏特纳担纲主演，可谓是CBS为这个老戏骨量身打造的喜剧，故事讲述的是一个叫做Ed的老头，独身在家、性格古怪、讲话直率，而且一把年纪了，还有着无穷无尽的抒发欲，喜爱对他人品头论足，喜欢对儿子指手画脚，还喜欢针砭时事。Ed就连看到自己儿子和女生调情，都要在后面加以指导，总之是个令人拍案、喷饭和叫绝的奇老头，且完全取材于现实，剧中的笑料、设置和大体情节均来自于美国著名微博网站上的一个用户“SXXXMyDadSays”(我老爸说脏话)的记录和博文。去年的8月3日，29岁的贾斯汀·哈尔珀恩在国外著名微博网站上开通了这个账号，专门记录自己73岁的老爸山姆的箴言警句。山姆老爹早年在加州大学的核药品基地工作，他的儿子发现老爸退休后，独自在家却满嘴“理论脏话”，且都非常有创意：比如大肠蠕动的恶心笑话，比如把女友和地铁做比较。于是，贾斯汀开始利用140字的每日微博来更新老爸的笑话，不知不觉中，到今年9月，“老爸说脏话”的用户量已经达到了170万人，无数的粉丝群涌来看“老爸说脏话”，而这个微博也成为美国互联网的年度神话。同名喜剧《老爸说脏话》则是全球首部基于微博素材的电视剧，本剧自9月播出后收视上涨，首播就获得1250万的收视总人数，成功引发微博笑话热潮，CBS眼疾手快地为本剧预定了整季。微博热打破传统制作微博题材剧的成绩斐然，让CBS在剧本荒和创意荒的当下找到了机会和途径，随即将目光瞄准了微博站点上的另外两位博主：一位经常引述住在他家楼上的女孩的言论，并加以男性化的点评，令人啼笑皆非，博客名为“楼上的姑娘”；第二位的用户名叫作“嘘……别告诉史蒂芬”，他是一个和奇怪室友住在一起的可怜人，经常被室友的无厘头行为折磨，无奈之下只好在微博上诉苦吐槽。以上两位讲述周遭人生活的真实性和幽默感也令其成为“红博”，并代表了五味杂陈的生活。于是，简单快捷能够集合大众智慧的微博素材成为当下娱乐圈的新素材、新沟通途径和新的聚集点，王菲在自己的微博上说：“自从有了微博，我们都成了自己的狗仔。”没错，微博成就了明星们的曝光率，同时也成了各大电视网的宣传工具和营销手段。在美剧领域，每一部剧集在开播前都需要重金推广，台前幕后的广告来引发各类话题，而这些稳固的旧式宣传也因为微博的出现有所改变，营销策略预示有了新的阵营。今年的几部剧集《废柴联盟》、《外包公司》、《警察世家》等都采用了微博营销，比如邀请演员在微博上你一言我一语地表演剧情，最善于利用微博营销的非僵尸大剧《行尸走肉》莫属。10月31日开播的该剧早在6月初就设立官方微博，并用公布10条僵尸法等非一般的宣传方式引起业界的强烈回响。在一波波的宣传攻势下，《行尸走肉》最终播出时候拿到了530万破纪录的收视率，微博所造成的集体效应可谓功不可没。而对于影视人，最具转折性意义的是微博题材作品的出现，像《老爸说脏话》这种剧集完全取材于普通人的生活和噱头，在互联网上传播几乎等于一场全民的集体创作，微博题材作品完全打破了好莱坞和美国电视人封闭性作业的工作模式，他们通过具有社区沟通感的网络看到草根们的想法、噱头，并将其收集和加工，形成更具有真实感和亲和力的作品。今年最热门的电影《网络社交》同样讲述了社区化工具和网络兴起的过程，人们从简单的维护个人网页和照片，到互相使用即时通讯工具来传递与沟通，可见如今的民众不仅过着衣食住行的生活，还在网络中延伸出了自己的平行世界和社交，而微博则是将虚拟与现实结合的工具，那上面记录的点点滴滴都是沧海一粟们不可忽略的步步人生。	贾斯汀,山姆,史蒂芬,威廉·夏特纳,小托,贾斯汀·哈尔珀恩,王菲	正向	"The 73 year old microblog father became a popular screen writer/Xiaotuo CBS made a ""difficult decision"" in 2010, and they tried to translate a popular microblog in the United States（ http://t.sina.com.cn ）The catchwords, jokes and funny gags on were adapted into a sitcom called ""Dad Says Bad Words"", which was widely broadcast in the autumn. The Weird Old Man draws on the microblog ""Dad Says Bad Words"", which is starred by Captain William Shatner in the old version of Star Trek. It can be described as a comedy tailored by CBS for this old play. The story is about an old man named Ed, who is single at home, eccentric, straightforward, and has an endless desire to express himself at an old age. He likes to criticize others, criticize his son, and criticize current events. Even when Ed saw his son flirting with girls, he had to give guidance later. In short, he was a strange old man who made a lot of jokes, cooked food and shouted, and was completely based on reality. The jokes, settings and general plot of the play were all from the records and blog posts of a user ""SXXXMyDadSays"" (my father said dirty words) on a famous microblog website in the United States. On August 3 last year, Justin Halpern, 29, opened this account on a famous foreign microblog website to record his 73 year old father Sam's proverbs. Sam's father worked in the nuclear medicine base of the University of California in his early years. His son found that after his father retired, he was alone at home but full of ""theoretical dirty words"", and they were very creative: such as the disgusting joke of large intestine peristalsis, such as comparing his girlfriend with the subway. As a result, Justin began to use his 140 word daily microblog to update his father's jokes. Unconsciously, by September of this year, the number of users of ""Dad swears"" had reached 1.7 million, and countless fans flocked to see ""Dad swears"". This microblog has also become the annual myth of the American Internet. The comedy ""Dad Says Bad Words"" of the same name is the world's first TV play based on microblog materials. Since its broadcast in September, the ratings of this play have risen, and the total number of viewers has reached 12.5 million when it first aired, which has successfully triggered a microblog joke craze. CBS is quick to book the whole season for this play. The microblog craze broke the tradition of making microblog themed dramas, which made CBS find opportunities and ways at the moment of script shortage and creativity shortage, and then targeted the other two bloggers on the microblog site: one often quoted the remarks of the girl who lives in his house upstairs, and gave male comments, which was ironic. The blog was called ""the girl upstairs""; The second one's user name is ""Shh... Don't tell Steven"". He is a poor man living with a strange roommate. He is often tortured by his roommate's unreasonable behavior, so he has to complain on microblog. The authenticity and sense of humor of the above two people's stories about the life around them also make them ""Hongbo"" and represent the mixed life of five flavors. As a result, the simple and quick microblog materials that can gather the wisdom of the public have become new materials, new communication channels and new gathering points in the current entertainment industry. Faye Wong said on her microblog: ""Since we have microblog, we have all become our own paparazzi."" Yes, microblog has achieved the exposure of stars, and has also become a publicity tool and marketing tool for major television networks. In the field of American TV series, every series needs to be promoted with heavy money before it is broadcast, and advertisements in front of and behind the stage can trigger various topics. These stable old propaganda has also changed due to the emergence of microblog, and the marketing strategy indicates a new camp. Several dramas of this year, such as Waste Diesel Alliance, Outsourcing Company, and Police Family, have adopted microblog marketing. For example, actors are invited to perform the story in microblog. The non zombie drama Walking Dead is the best one to use microblog marketing. The play, which was launched on October 31, set up an official microblog as early as early as June, and aroused strong response in the industry by publishing 10 zombie laws and other unusual publicity methods. Under the wave after wave of propaganda, ""The Walking Dead"" finally got a record breaking audience rating of 5.3 million when it was broadcasted. The collective effect caused by microblogging can be attributed to it. For film and television people, the most significant turning point is the emergence of microblog themed works, such as ""Dad Says Bad Words"", which is totally based on the lives and gags of ordinary people. Spreading it on the Internet is almost a collective creation of the whole people. The microblog themed works completely break the closed work mode of Hollywood and American TV people. They see the ideas and gags of grassroots people through the network with a sense of community communication, and collect and process them to form works with more authenticity and affinity. The most popular movie of this year, ""Online Social Networking"", also tells the rise of community tools and the Internet. From simple maintenance of personal web pages and photos to the use of instant messaging tools to deliver and communicate with each other, it can be seen that today's people not only live a life of clothing, food, shelter and transportation, but also extend their own parallel world and social networking in the Internet. Microblog is a tool that combines virtual and reality. Every bit recorded on it is a step by step life that can not be ignored by a drop in the ocean."

At the beginning of the second half, Luneng Team once again launched a fierce attack on the hinterland of Quanbei Hyundai Team. In the 52nd minute, Taishan Team attacked. Wang Yongpo calmly buckled the defender in the restricted area, missed the best scoring opportunity by hitting the near corner. However, Luneng's massive pressure on the attack has also given the entire North Modern Team an opportunity to take advantage of. In the 63rd minute, although Luneng team took the initiative, Quanbei Hyundai was very patient with Luneng team, and suddenly played a quick counter attack. Many players jumped at the Luneng team's defense line at the same time, and finally, Lin Xiangjie, 23, pushed the empty door to win. Quanbei Hyundai takes a 2-0 lead.

曼联搭救欧文成就史上惊人转会民意测试七成表态赞成记者林良锋报道欧文加盟曼联！这是本月最令足坛震惊的消息。曼联上月初失去金球奖得主C罗，本月第一天又获悉夏季最大引援目标本泽马决定投奔伯纳乌，拥趸们尚未消化这个打击，更咋舌的消息接踵而至：握着8000万英镑的现金，曼联对失去C罗的反应，是花掉不足1/4进项签下厄瓜多尔人瓦伦西亚，对错过本泽马则是一分钱不花，吃进刚“失业”的欧文，另一位金球奖得主。这一举动别说让业界眼镜碎了一地，球迷张口结舌，连事主欧文也承认：“做梦再没谱，几天前我也不会想到曼联会要我！现在一想到将和曼联球员一道比赛，我怕是也难以入眠。”绝境遇“贵人”7月3日傍晚近7时，曼联在官网确认：我们已经签下欧文。合约两年，欧文是自由身故无转会费。曼联没有交代欧文的待遇，但绝不会是他在纽卡的12万英镑。据悉，欧文接受大幅降薪，具体数额众说纷纭，一说他的周薪只有5万，一说只有2万，可以肯定的是，他的收入将根据表现、进球和帮助曼联夺得的奖项三块来决定。欧文绝境之中遇到弗爵出手搭救，哪里顾得上讨价还价：“我刚和几家球会开始斟酌加盟细节，突然在7月1日下午接到弗爵打来电话，邀我次日共进早餐。席间他告诉我，曼联想签我。我想都没想就答应了。”欧文就此成为英超史上第2位先后效力过利物浦和曼联的球员，另一人是因斯，方向相反，两人均非直接易主，欧文转道皇马和纽卡，因斯则由国际米兰回流。最后一位直接转会的成名球员是奇斯纳尔，发生在“远古”的1965年。噩梦结束了，说欧文欣喜若狂毫不过分。自从赛季结束，欧文的经纪公司就为给他找下家挠头，为此不惜搞了一份32页的推销册子，让欧文由伤兵变成笑柄。不是只有欧联杯机会的埃弗顿和阿斯顿维拉，更不是需要保级的斯托克或者赫尔，而是出征冠军杯的卫冕冠军曼联出手搭救，这对欧文真是喜从天降，也省了经纪人挨家挨户锱铢必较。他对弗格森千恩万谢：“我感谢弗爵对我抱有信心。我保证会以进球和良好的发挥回报他的信任。这些年来我从和曼联球员的交流中得知，弗爵还觉得我有戏，我也一直怀着希望，有朝一日他会邀请我效力曼联。有些人会觉得弗爵不该签我，新赛季一开始我将在场上回敬他们。”弗格森此举被广泛视为冒险，就在前一天，善于挖掘老将潜力的布莱克本主教练阿勒代斯公开表示不考虑欧文，“我们养不起他，我需要一位能一个赛季保证上场30多次的前锋，根据他过去多年的履历，好像不是那么回事。”之前，只有赫尔的前利物浦球员巴姆比呼吁东家接纳这位英格兰国脚。轻松通过体检关弗格森欣赏欧文，数次欲将他召至帐下都未成功。早在欧文以学徒身份加盟利物浦前便试探过，但欧文尊父命选择了安菲尔德。2005年欧文担心打不了世界杯，决意离开皇马，弗格森又动过接手欧文的念头，但遭纽卡抬价不得已放弃，一年之后，弗爵拟以1200万英镑再邀，欧文不幸因伤倒在世界杯赛场边，一躺就是一个赛季，转会再次告吹。再获邀约，欧文立刻觉得生活充满阳光：“这是个极好机会，我要双手把握它。我憧憬代表曼联上场的那一刻，幸运的是我已经熟悉他们中的很多人。上赛季我错过了(纽卡的)季前训练，现在我可以从第一天开始。”弗格森话不多：“他是个世界级的球员，在顶级赛事中证明过自己的进球能力，带着我们对他的期望加盟曼联，是他很感兴趣的邀请。”曼联是否继续在转会市场求购前锋是个问号，7月2日晚间仍有传闻称曼联对塞维利亚的巴西前锋法比亚诺有意。欧文自加盟纽卡之后伤病不断，膝盖、腹股沟和大腿肌腱都受过不同程度的伤，能否加盟曼联，取决于他的体能状况。2日和弗爵晤面后，他立刻在伦敦检查了自己在2006世界杯受过重创的膝盖，未见有恙，便在3日前往卡灵顿基地接受体检。2日午后，天空电视台的博彩部门发现赌客们持续下注欧文加盟曼联，觉得事有蹊跷，立刻在3时许将赔率由开盘时的1赔20锐减至4赔7，并在深夜续降至1赔1并最终封盘。此时，欧文即将投奔曼联的消息已经充斥大小媒体和网络，天空电视台于晚间9时的新闻确认欧文去定老特拉福德，2小时后BBC也予以确认。7月3日的体检分两步：曼联测完，欧文又赴当地的一家私人医院再检，全部通过，欧文对自己的身体状况颇为自得：“我觉得大家都对我的体检结果有点吃惊。我(上赛季)早就通过了各项检查，我目前的状态很好，关于我的伤势人们说了很多，但我不觉得我是个玻璃人。”欧文将再次获得与国家队锋线搭档鲁尼合作的机会，这对他重返国家队是极大的利好，意味着他可能赶上世界杯预选赛的末班车，以表现赢得卡佩罗的信任，卡佩罗也间接表达了对这笔转会的支持。曼联和利物浦球迷对这桩交易反应不一，网络民意测试，七成左右的人认为这是笔好买卖。	林良锋,纽卡,阿勒代斯,奇斯纳尔,本泽马,因斯,赫尔,法比亚诺,欧文,巴姆比,鲁尼,斯托克,卡佩罗,C罗,弗格森,弗爵,伯纳乌	正向	"70% of the public opinion polls in the history of Manchester United's amazing transfer of Michael Owen agree with the reporter Lin Liangfeng to report that Michael Owen has joined Manchester United! This is the most shocking news in football this month. At the beginning of last month, Manchester United lost Ronaldo, the winner of the Golden Globe Award. On the first day of this month, it was learned that Benzema, the biggest summer target, had decided to go to the Bernabeu. Fans had not yet digested the blow, and more shocking news came one after another: with 80 million pounds in cash, Manchester United's response to the loss of Ronaldo was to spend less than a quarter of its money on signing Valencia, an Ecuadorian. For missing Benzema, it was not worth a penny. It was just ""unemployed"" Owen, another winner of the Golden Globe Award. This move, let alone the industry's glasses, broke the ground. The fans were tongue tied, and even the victim Owen admitted: ""I never dreamed that Manchester United would want me a few days ago! Now I'm afraid I can't sleep at the thought of playing with Manchester United's players."" At nearly 7 p.m. on the evening of July 3, when encountering a ""noble man"" in a desperate situation, Manchester United confirmed on its official website that we have signed Owen. The contract is two years, Owen died free of charge. United did not explain Owen's treatment, but it will never be his 120000 pounds in Newcastle. It is reported that Owen has accepted a substantial salary cut. The specific amount is controversial. His weekly salary is only 50000 and 20000. It is certain that his income will be determined according to his performance, goals and the awards he helped Manchester United win. When Owen met Sir Alex Ferguson when he was desperate, he didn't care about bargaining: ""I had just started to consider the details of joining with several clubs, and suddenly received a phone call from Sir Alex Ferguson on the afternoon of July 1, inviting me to have breakfast the next day. During the dinner, he told me that Manchester United wanted to sign me. I agreed without thinking."" Owen became the second player in the history of the Premier League who had played for Liverpool and Manchester United successively, and the other one was Ince, in the opposite direction. Both of them did not change owners directly. Owen turned to Real Madrid and Newcastle, and Ince returned from Inter Milan. The last player who became famous through direct transfer was Chisner, which took place in the ""ancient"" year of 1965. The nightmare was over, and it was no exaggeration to say that Owen was ecstatic. Since the end of the season, Owen's agency has been scratching its head about finding a new job for him, and has prepared a 32 page promotional brochure to make Owen a laughingstock from a wounded soldier. It is not only Everton and Aston Villa who have the chance to play in the Europa League, nor Stoke or Hull who need to be relegated, but also Manchester United, the defending champion who went to the Champions League, who came to the rescue. This is really a blessing for Owen, and it also saves the agent from haggling from door to door. He thanked Ferguson with gratitude: ""I thank Sir Alex for his confidence in me. I promise to repay his trust with goals and good performance. Over the years, I learned from my exchanges with Manchester United players that Sir Alex still thinks I am interesting, and I have always hoped that one day he will invite me to play for Manchester United. Some people will feel that Sir Alex should not sign me, and I will repay them on the court at the beginning of the new season."" Ferguson's move is widely regarded as a risk. The day before, Blackburn head coach Allardyce, who is good at tapping the potential of veteran, publicly said that he does not consider Owen, ""We can't afford him, I need a man who can last season The striker who has guaranteed to play more than 30 times, according to his resume over the past years, seems to be different."", Only Hull's former Liverpool player Bambi called on the club to accept the England international. Ferguson easily passed the medical examination to appreciate Owen, and failed to recruit him to the account several times. As early as Owen tried before joining Liverpool as an apprentice, but Owen chose Anfield. In 2005, Owen was worried that he could not play in the World Cup and decided to leave Real Madrid. Ferguson was tempted to take over Owen, but was forced to give up by Newcastle. A year later, Sir Alex planned to invite him again for 12 million pounds. Unfortunately, Owen fell down on the sidelines of the World Cup due to injury, and the transfer failed again. When he was invited again, Owen immediately felt that his life was full of sunshine: ""This is an excellent opportunity. I want to grasp it with both hands. I look forward to the moment when I play on behalf of Manchester United. Fortunately, I have already known many of them. I missed (Newcastle United's) pre-season training last season, and now I can start from the first day."" Ferguson did not say much: ""He is a world-class player. He has proved his ability to score goals in top competitions, and he is very interested in joining Manchester United with our expectations for him."" Whether Manchester United will continue to buy front-line players in the transfer market is a question mark. On the evening of July 2, there is still a rumor that Manchester United are still interested in Seville Brazilian striker Fabiano is interested. Since joining Newcastle, Owen has suffered from injuries to his knee, groin and thigh tendons. Whether he can join Manchester United depends on his physical condition. After meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson on the 2nd, he immediately checked his knee, which had been severely injured in the 2006 World Cup, in London, and found no injuries. He went to Carrington for a medical examination on the 3rd. In the afternoon of the second day, the gambling department of Sky Television found that gamblers kept betting that Michael Owen would join Manchester United. They thought there was something strange, and immediately reduced the odds from 20/1 at the opening to 7/4 at about 3:00, and then fell to 1/1 late at night and finally closed. At this time, the news that Michael Owen was about to leave for Manchester United was already full of media and networks. Sky TV confirmed Michael Owen's move to Old Trafford at 9:00 p.m., and the BBC confirmed it two hours later. On July 3, the physical examination was divided into two steps: Manchester United finished the test, and Owen went to a local private hospital for re examination, all of which were passed. Owen was quite satisfied with his physical condition: ""I think everyone was a little surprised at my physical examination results. I (last season) had passed various examinations long ago, and my current state is very good. People have said a lot about my injury, but I don't think I am a glass man."" Owen will again get the opportunity to cooperate with Wayne Rooney, the national team's forward partner, which is a great benefit for his return to the national team, meaning that he may catch the last bus of the World Cup qualifiers, and win Capello's trust by performance Capello also indirectly expressed his support for the transfer. Manchester United and Liverpool fans have different reactions to the deal. According to online opinion polls, about 70% of people think it is a good deal."
美国政府尚未决定派特使赴朝鲜营救女记者晨报记者徐惠芬在朝鲜获刑12年的两名美国女记者的家人8日联合发表声明，恳求朝鲜方面放人。有分析认为，美国可能会派出一名特别使节，与朝鲜洽谈释放女记者事宜。但美国政府目前尚未对谈判一事明确表态，只称美国会利用一切可能途径，说服朝鲜释放这两名女记者。不过，美联社9日援引一名美国高官的话称，目前已有相关人员与白宫和国务院进行了联系，商讨下一步可能的步骤，包括派遣使节与朝方谈判释放女记者问题。女记者身体不佳被判刑女记者的家人8日发表声明，恳求朝鲜方面放人。此前，两名女记者的亲友及支持者在美国的一些城市举行了烛光守夜，愿这两名女记者可以得到宽大处理。“我们仍然希望，美国和朝鲜两国政府能就放人达成一致。”声明说，“我们恳请朝鲜政府展示怜悯之心宽恕志美和丽娜，允许她们回到家人身边。”声明还说，两名女记者是受电视台派遣，前往中朝边境做这项工作的，“我们不知道3月17日发生了什么，如果她们未经允许越境，我们代表她俩表示道歉”。两人的家人还表示，凌患有溃疡，健康状况不佳，在这一判刑下身体状况会进一步恶化；而李则有一个4岁的女儿等着她，“因为见不到妈妈而出现烦躁迹象”。声明说：“她们在无法与家人取得联系的情况下被扣留3个月，已经够长了。”美未明言派特使与此同时，美国政府正在谋求两名女记者获释。对于美国是否会派使节前往朝鲜，美国国务卿希拉里未给出明确答复，只称，美国会利用一切可能途径，说服朝鲜释放这两名女记者。白宫发言人吉布斯在8日举行的记者会上说：“此事属于人道主义问题。这两名女性没有犯错，应让她们回到家人的身边。”吉布斯还说：“美国政府正在为释放作努力。两人的关押与其他问题没有关系，希望朝鲜不要这么做。”美国一名高级官员在接受美联社采访时称，目前新墨西哥州州长比尔·理查森和前副总统阿尔·戈尔都已与白宫和国务院进行了联系，商讨下一步可能的步骤，包括派遣使节与朝方谈判释放女记者问题。不过这名高级官员强调，目前美国政府尚未正式决定如何开展工作，上述两人也还没有收到美国政府的正式邀请，前往朝鲜进行谈判。此外，另据韩国媒体报道，美国加利福尼亚州州长阿诺德·施瓦辛格8日就朝鲜对两名女记者判重刑一事发表声明称，他将会力助两名女记者获释。据英德媒体报道，金正日的三儿子金正云是施瓦辛格的“超级粉丝”。美国特使人选有三理查森：曾经两次赴朝鲜领回美国人新墨西哥州州长比尔·理查森被认为是热门人选之一。理查森自己也明确表态，称只要奥巴马政府有需要，自己随时准备好出力。1994年和1996年，时任美国国会众议员比尔·理查森曾两次赴朝，“领回”遭朝军俘获的驻韩美国空军飞行员鲍比·霍尔和由经鸭绿江入朝的美国人埃文·洪齐克。不过，上述两起事件的当事人没有受到朝鲜方面的审判。2007年4月，理查森还率领美国民间代表团，前往朝鲜寻找并带回在朝鲜战争中阵亡的美国士兵的遗骸。理查森认为，朝鲜对女记者判重刑是在玩“高风险游戏”。他表示，既然现在法律程序已经走完，有关释放的谈判就可以开始了。“从我之前所参加的谈判实例来看，一般只有等法律程序走完后，谈判才有可能开始。”理查森还透露，奥巴马政府官员与他已有过接触，向他询问了有关意见。理查森说，如果奥巴马政府要求他代表政府前往朝鲜谈判，他会很乐意，并做一切可能的努力。不过，他同时表示“现在是非常敏感的时刻”。理查森对这两名女记者获释的前景表示谨慎乐观。他说，尽管这一判决比较重，但“好消息是判决理由不是间谍罪，而是非法入境和敌意行为”。理查森称，从目前看来，朝鲜至少没有在公共场合将这一事件与核问题挂起钩来。他说，他还观察到在女记者的问题上，朝鲜没有使用特别好战的措辞。戈尔：曾在华盛顿招待朝鲜高官广受赞誉韩国媒体日前报道称，美国前副总统阿尔·戈尔近期可能将以民间身份访问朝鲜，以争取两名美国女记者获释。一名外交消息人士称，戈尔打算以“潮流电视台”创始人的身份经北京前往朝鲜，并“带回那两名女记者”。不过，戈尔对此没有评论。据称，外界普遍看好戈尔前往朝鲜进行谈判。有分析认为，戈尔作为使节有三大优势：戈尔享有很高的国际声誉，在环境方面的工作广受认可；2000年，时任美国副总统的戈尔曾在华盛顿设晚宴招待朝鲜高官，至今这一举动仍在朝鲜广受赞誉；戈尔是被判刑女记者所在电视台的创建人之一，目前还是该电视台的主席。被扣留的这两名记者都在该电视台的“先锋”节目组任职，其中凌志美为美籍华裔员工，李丽娜为美籍韩裔员工。据称，这家“潮流电视台”的前身是“国际新闻世界”频道，播出范围覆盖美国1900多万个家庭。曾任美国前总统布什的亚洲高级顾问威克特·车称，美国政府有必要派出像戈尔这样高级别的使节前往朝鲜进行谈判。“朝鲜是一个很在乎面子的国家，派遣像戈尔这个级别的谈判人士是有必要的。”施瓦辛格：金正云据称是阿诺德的“粉丝”虽然美国加利福尼亚州州长阿诺德·施瓦辛格未明确表态希望能前往朝鲜进行谈判，但8日他发表声明称，将会力助女记者获释。据英国《泰晤士报》8日报道，朝鲜最高领导人金正日的三儿子金正云的昔日同窗透露，在瑞士伯尔尼国际学校求学期间，金正云和其他男生一样，是“世界上最强壮的男人”阿诺德·施瓦辛格的超级粉丝，热衷观看好莱坞大片《终结者》。据称，施瓦辛格8日对美国女记者在朝鲜被判重刑一事表示：“旧金山市‘潮流电视台’的记者李丽娜和凌志美，是从事民主主义和自由的核心新闻人，我的妻子和我听到她们被判刑的消息后，非常难过。”施瓦辛格称：“我非常关注两名美国女记者的情况，并为她们祈祷。加利福尼亚州将会不惜一切努力，帮助2名记者获释。”	希拉里,比尔·理查森,凌志美,施瓦辛格,吉布斯,阿诺德·施瓦辛格,徐惠芬,戈尔,阿尔·戈尔,金正云,理查森,丽娜,金正日,鲍比·霍尔,威克特,埃文·洪齐克,李丽娜,阿诺德	正向	"The US government has not yet decided to send a special envoy to North Korea to rescue a female journalist, Morning Post reporter Xu Huifen, who was sentenced to 12 years in North Korea. The family of two American female journalists jointly issued a statement on the 8th, imploring the North Korean side to release them. Some analysts believe that the United States may send a special envoy to negotiate with the DPRK on the release of female journalists. However, the US government has not yet made a clear statement on the negotiation, only saying that the US will use all possible ways to persuade North Korea to release the two women journalists. However, the Associated Press quoted a senior US official on the 9th as saying that at present, relevant personnel have contacted the White House and the State Department to discuss possible next steps, including sending envoys to negotiate with the DPRK to release women journalists. The family members of the sentenced female journalists who were in poor health issued a statement on the 8th, imploring the North Korean side to release them. Earlier, relatives, friends and supporters of the two women journalists held candlelight vigils in some cities in the United States, hoping that the two women journalists can get lenient treatment. ""We still hope that the governments of the United States and North Korea can reach an agreement on the release of people."" The statement said, ""We implore the North Korean government to show mercy and forgive Zhimei and Lina, and allow them to return to their families."" The statement also said that the two women journalists were sent by television stations to do this work on the border between China and North Korea. ""We don't know what happened on March 17. If they cross the border without permission, we apologize on behalf of them."". Their families also said that Ling suffered from ulcers and was in poor health, which would worsen under this sentence; Li Ze had a 4-year-old daughter waiting for her, ""because she could not see her mother, she showed signs of irritability"". The statement said: ""It has been long enough for them to be detained for three months without contacting their families."" At the same time, the US government is seeking the release of two female journalists. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not give a clear answer to whether the United States would send envoys to North Korea, but said that the United States would use all possible ways to persuade North Korea to release the two women journalists. At a press conference held on the 8th, White House spokesman Gibbs said: ""This is a humanitarian issue. The two women did not make any mistakes and should be allowed to return to their families."" Gibbs also said: ""The United States government is making efforts to release them. Their detention has nothing to do with other issues, and he hopes North Korea will not do so."" A senior American official told the Associated Press that at present, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and former Vice President Al Gore have contacted the White House and the State Department to discuss possible next steps, including sending envoys to negotiate with the DPRK to release women journalists. However, the senior official stressed that at present, the US government has not officially decided how to carry out its work, and the two people have not received an official invitation from the US government to go to North Korea for negotiations. In addition, according to South Korean media reports, Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, issued a statement on the 8th about the North Korean sentencing of two women journalists, saying that he would help the two women journalists to be released. According to British and German media reports, Kim Jong un, Kim Jong Il's third son, is Schwarzenegger's ""super fan"". There are three candidates for the US envoy: Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico, who went to North Korea twice to bring back Americans, is considered one of the most popular candidates. Richardson himself made it clear that he was ready to contribute whenever the Obama administration needed. In 1994 and 1996, Bill Richardson, then a member of the United States Congress, went to North Korea twice to ""take back"" Bobby Hall, a US air force pilot in South Korea captured by the North Korean army, and Evan Hunzick, an American who entered North Korea via the Yalu River. However, the parties involved in the above two events were not tried by the DPRK. In April 2007, Richardson also led a US civilian delegation to Korea to find and bring back the remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean War. Richardson believes that North Korea is playing a ""high-risk game"" by sentencing women journalists severely. He said that now that the legal process has been completed, negotiations on release can begin. ""From the examples of the negotiations I have participated in before, it is generally only after the completion of the legal process that the negotiations can begin."" Richardson also revealed that Obama administration officials have contacted him and asked him for relevant opinions. Richardson said that if the Obama administration asked him to go to North Korea for negotiations on behalf of the government, he would be happy to do everything possible. However, he also said that ""this is a very sensitive moment"". Richardson expressed cautious optimism about the prospect of the release of the two women journalists. He said that although the judgment was relatively heavy, ""the good news is that the reason for the judgment is not espionage, but illegal entry and hostile acts"". Richardson said that, at present, North Korea has at least not linked this incident to the nuclear issue in public. He said that he also observed that the DPRK did not use particularly bellicose language on the issue of women journalists. Gore: The South Korean media reported that Al Gore, the former Vice President of the United States, may visit North Korea as a private citizen in the near future to win the release of two American female journalists. A diplomatic source said that Gore intended to travel to North Korea via Beijing as the founder of ""Tide TV"" and ""bring back the two women journalists"". However, Gore did not comment on this. It is said that the outside world is generally optimistic about Gore going to North Korea for negotiations. Some analysts believe that Gore has three advantages as an envoy: Gore enjoys a high international reputation and is widely recognized for his environmental work; In 2000, Al Gore, then the Vice President of the United States, hosted a dinner in Washington to entertain senior officials in North Korea, which is still widely praised in North Korea; Gore is one of the founders of the TV station where the sentenced female journalist works, and is currently the chairman of the TV station. The two detained journalists both worked in the TV station's ""Pioneer"" program group, of which Ling Zhimei was an American Chinese employee and Li Lina was an American Korean employee. It is said that the predecessor of this ""trend TV station"" is the ""International News World"" channel, which covers more than 19 million families in the United States. Viktor Che, a senior Asian adviser to former US President Bush, said that it was necessary for the US government to send high-level envoys like Gore to North Korea for negotiations. ""North Korea is a country that cares about face, so it is necessary to send negotiators at the level of Gore."" Schwarzenegger: Kim Jong un is said to be a ""fan"" of Arnold. Although Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, did not explicitly express his wish to go to North Korea for negotiations, he issued a statement on the 8th, saying that he would help the female journalists to be released. According to the British Times on the 8th, the former classmate of Kim Jong un, the third son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, revealed that while studying at the Berne International School in Switzerland, Kim Jong un, like other boys, was a super fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the ""strongest man in the world"", and was keen on watching the Hollywood blockbuster Terminator. It is said that Schwarzenegger said on the 8th that American female journalists were sentenced to a heavy sentence in North Korea: ""Li Lina and Ling Zhimei, reporters of San Francisco's"" Trend TV "", are core journalists engaged in democracy and freedom. My wife and I were very sad when we heard that they were sentenced."" Schwarzenegger said: ""I am very concerned about the situation of the two American female journalists and pray for them. California will spare no effort to help the two journalists to be released."""

It is a collective appearance of game manufacturers and a good opportunity for them to promote and negotiate cooperation. The editor has been keeping a close eye on the exhibitors at this conference. Recently, on the Sina official microblog of Beijing Zhangqu Technology Co., Ltd., the editor found the announcement that they are going to participate in the exhibition. The announcement said that Zhangqu Technology will appear on ChinaJoy together with the game base, and the booth is located in the mobile game base exhibition area of W2 pavilion. Since Huayi Brothers obtained a strategic investment of 150 million yuan in June 2010, Zhangqu Technology, an invisible leader in the field of mobile games, has suddenly become the focus of many capital and media. However, Zhangqu Technology still adheres to its consistent low-key style. In the past year, except for some important conferences, such as the ChinaJoy Conference and the Global Mobile Internet Conference of the Great Wall Conference, it was rarely seen in other conferences. Later, the editor contacted Zhangqu Technology to verify his participation in the CJ exhibition. The relevant person in charge of Zhangqu Technology replied that Zhangqu had indeed decided to participate in the CJ Conference. The person in charge also briefly introduced the relevant situation of this exhibition. At the invitation of the mobile game base, this exhibition confirmed that there were two games in the exhibition, which were key game products of Palm Fun Technology with its own copyright. One of them is the mobile online game ""Genghis Khan Online"", which is said to be the first war themed game in the mobile online game industry. It is currently in the internal testing stage. As one of the main games this year, Palm Fun Technology has high hopes for it; Another web game product of ancient fantasy theme, Magic Mirror Online, has achieved good results after more than half a year of operation. The editor learned that this time, users can participate in the game experience on the spot and give gifts. From the selection of products and the arrangement of activities for the exhibition, I think that the purpose of this event is to lead everyone from the ancient battlefield where the golden battle swept the Eurasian continent to the ancient world where the chaos was just beginning to fight among gods, to have a time and space journey and experience the magic journey! In addition, according to the Vice President of Huayi, Huayi Brothers announced the change of the agreement with the mobile game company - Handfun Technology last Thursday, terminating the other party's performance commitment in advance, saying that they had considerable confidence in its performance, and encouraged Handfun to do more layout and investment. This news has again focused the attention of many media on Handfun Technology. Xiao Bian learned from the official website of Palm Fun Technology that the business of Palm Fun Technology continues to expand from mobile stand-alone games and portal sites. It has not only entered the mature Webgame web game market for a long time, but also laid out the promising mobile online game market. At present, a product line matrix has been formed with four lines going hand in hand, including mobile single game, mobile online game, smartphone (Android, iPhone) game and Webgame web game, which is also in the forefront of the industry. According to internal information, the game of the same name of the intelligent terminal (Android version) of Iplay's Speed and Passion, which was just launched in June in the mobile game base, will also be released nationwide by Palm Fun Technology in the near future. It seems that Palm Fun Technology is accelerating the pace of the Android market. I have reason to make an optimistic forecast here. With the support and confidence of investors and my own steady style, I believe that Handfun Technology will give more and more wonderful answers on the road of future development."
专家支招：留学签证申请被拒后如何自救准留学(微博)生忙碌了一年甚至更多的时间，万事俱备，却被拒签，这会让很多学生一时难以接受。毕业生在申请签证时拒签该如何应对？会不会因为被拒签而错过入学？如果错过入学的话该怎么办？就此，笔者采访了华申留学美国中心经理张念红、北美中心经理周于虹、西欧部经理梁?昕。加拿大：可再次申请，也可跟学校商量迟到1-2周一般大四的学生申请加拿大留学都会提早至少1年准备，所以申请签证出现拒签的概率还是很小的。加拿大拒签基本有两种情况，一是学习目的问题，基本是申请的学校或专业与学生的背景不匹配，造成签证官对学生学习目的的怀疑。这种情况是非常致命的，因为学校和专业是早已申请好的，等到签证结果出来再改学校，选择的余地不会很大，有时甚至基本都截止申请了。这个时候可以考虑申请别的课程，如研究生证书、或研究生预科，或先去加拿大读语言，然后在转入合适的课程，这虽是曲线救国但也比申请来年的课程节省了时间。二是资金问题。加拿大签证历来对资金的来源要求很高。拒签如果是因为没有说明清楚，可以找有经验的中介帮助补充材料和写来源说明。这些说明一定要是合理合法并符合签证官的要求，不然也会同样遭到拒签。目前加拿大对申请人的学校和雅思(微博)等要求采取不同的签证政策，如果资金有问题，也可以申请符合要求的学校或是考出雅思，这样可以简化资金来源说明材料，同样可以获得签证。目前的学生签证周期是2-3周，一般只要不是最后时刻的拒签，都可以再次申请。如果办理的太匆忙或者没有时间再次申请签证将要错过入学时间，一般可以与学校联系，推迟入学。但是有些硕士课程是根据导师的项目和资金录取学生的，要推迟很可能会有困难。如果你的签证在开学前还迟迟没有出来，可以跟学校商量，迟到1-2周。普通情况下，签证官也会根据学生的开学时间来加速审理，但是签证高峰时期或是申请的太晚的学生，也不能保证可以及时获得签证。美国：拒签后可以预约新一次签证面试张念红指出，目前美国学生签证总体通过情况良好，但也有不少准备不充分导致不能顺利拿到签证的学生。申请美国签证的学生需要注意各领馆领区的划分，如某位学生护照的签发地为北京，但学生平时常住地在上海，在去上海领馆签证时，忘记携带自己的房产证和户口本因此无法证明自己的常住地是上海，而被拒签。更有部分学生由于事先没有提前进行问答模拟，现场与签证官面试时紧张导致不能很好的回答签证官问题而被拒签。每个学生的家庭情况各不相同，使领馆的网站和咨询电话往往无法根据学生的具体情况给予明确的答复，在签证前更要根据自己的求学目标设计好问题和答案进行模拟。美国签证拒签后随时可以预约新一次的签证面试，但由于每个领馆名额有限，很有可能学生能预约的面签时间已经晚于学校的要求到校时间。发生这样的情况不用太着急，学生可以根据自己的具体情况向领馆申请加急预约，或者向学校申请晚几天到校，当然也可以选择作好准备完善材料向学校申请推迟一个学期入学。英国：要注意细节，再次申请签证最好找专业公司帮忙英国的签证，只要按照领馆的要求，基本是不会被拒签的，而且领馆的要求非常明确并且简单。梁?昕表示，曾有个学生被牛津大学录取，该学生自己就在英国读书，只是续签，结果太无视英国的规定而导致拒签。理由非常简单，就是存款证明过期了，表格少填了点内容。之后他又重新签证过2次，都因为不谨慎，不是少了这个就是缺了那个，结果还是拒签，就眼睁睁放着牛津大学的录取通知书不能入学。类似这种情况的学生不在少数，每年总有些丢三落四的学生被拒之门外。所以，对于申请英国签证的学生而言，签证并不难，难在是否能注意细节，严格按照并领会英国领馆的规定来提供材料。对于拒签学生，梁?昕建议学生如果是自己申请签证的，一旦第一次拒签，就不要再自己申请了，找一个专业的中介公司来帮你准备申请材料，如果再拒签几次，再获得签证的难度会提高，并且也会耽误时间。梁?昕提醒在找中介公司时一定要注意审核其是否是专业的公司。	张念红,周于虹	正向	Experts' advice: how to save the prospective students after their application for a study visa is rejected. After a busy year or more, they have everything ready, but they are rejected. This will make many students hard to accept. What should graduates do when they refuse to apply for a visa? Will you miss the admission because of being refused a visa? What should I do if I miss the entrance? In this regard, the author interviewed Zhang Nianhong, manager of Huashen International Studies Center in the United States, Zhou Yuhong, manager of North America Center, and Liang?, manager of Western Europe Department? Xin. Canada: You can apply again, or you can discuss with the school that students who are late for 1-2 weeks to apply for studying in Canada will be prepared at least one year in advance, so the probability of visa refusal is very small. There are basically two cases of visa refusal in Canada. One is the purpose of study. The main reason is that the school or major applied for does not match the student's background, which causes visa officers to doubt the student's purpose of study. This situation is very fatal, because schools and majors have already applied for them. When the visa results come out, there is not much choice. Sometimes, the application is almost closed. At this time, you can consider applying for other courses, such as graduate certificates, or graduate preparatory courses, or go to Canada to study languages first, and then transfer to appropriate courses. Although this is a curve to save the country, it also saves time than applying for the next year's courses. The second is funding. Canadian visas have always had high requirements for the source of funds. If the reason for refusal is that there is no clear explanation, you can find an experienced intermediary to help supplement materials and write source descriptions. These instructions must be reasonable and legal and meet the requirements of the visa officer, otherwise they will also be refused. At present, Canada has adopted different visa policies for applicants' schools and IELTS (microblog) requirements. If there is a problem with funds, you can also apply for qualified schools or pass the IELTS exam. This can simplify the explanation of the source of funds, and you can also obtain a visa. The current student visa cycle is 2-3 weeks. Generally, if the visa is not rejected at the last moment, you can apply again. If you are in a hurry or have no time to apply for a visa again, you will miss the enrollment time. You can generally contact the school to postpone enrollment. However, some master's programs are based on the tutor's projects and funds, so it may be difficult to postpone them. If your visa is still late before the start of school, you can discuss with the school to be 1-2 weeks late. Under normal circumstances, the visa officer will also speed up the process according to the student's starting time. However, students who apply too late during the peak period of the visa cannot guarantee that they can obtain the visa in time. The United States: After refusing the visa, Zhang Nianhong can make an appointment for a new visa interview. Zhang Nianhong pointed out that at present, the student visa in the United States is generally passed, but there are also many students who are not fully prepared and can not get the visa smoothly. Students applying for a US visa need to pay attention to the division of the consular districts of each consulate. For example, a student's passport is issued in Beijing, but the student usually lives in Shanghai. When going to the consulate in Shanghai for a visa, he forgot to bring his property certificate and household registration book, so he could not prove that his permanent residence was Shanghai, and was refused the visa. Some students were rejected because they did not have a question and answer simulation in advance and were nervous during the on-site interview with the visa officer, so they could not answer the visa officer's questions well. Each student's family situation is different, so the consulate's website and consultation telephone often cannot give a clear answer according to the specific situation of the student. Before visa, it is necessary to design questions and answers according to their own learning goals for simulation. You can make an appointment for a new visa interview at any time after the US visa is refused. However, due to the limited number of seats in each consulate, it is likely that the appointment time for students to make an interview is later than the school's required arrival time. In this case, there is no need to worry. Students can apply to the consulate for an urgent appointment according to their specific conditions, or apply to the school for a few days late. Of course, they can also choose to prepare and improve the materials to apply to the school for a semester delay. UK: Attention should be paid to details. It is better to find a professional company to help you apply for a visa in the UK again. As long as you follow the requirements of the consulate, your visa will not be refused, and the requirements of the consulate are very clear and simple. Beam? Xin said that once a student was admitted to Oxford University, who was studying in the UK himself, but only renewed his contract. As a result, he ignored British regulations too much and refused to sign. The reason is very simple. The certificate of deposit is expired and the form is not filled in enough. After that, he applied for a new visa twice. Because he was careless, he either lacked one or the other, but he refused to apply. He could not enter the university without the admission notice of Oxford University. There are many students in this situation. Every year, some students who have lost everything are rejected. Therefore, for students applying for a UK visa, it is not difficult to obtain a visa. The difficulty lies in whether they can pay attention to details and provide materials in strict accordance with and understand the provisions of the British Consulate. Liang? Xin suggests that if students apply for visas themselves, they should not apply for visas themselves once they refuse to do so for the first time. They should find a professional intermediary company to help you prepare the application materials. If they refuse to apply for visas several more times, it will be more difficult to obtain visas again, and it will also delay time. Beam? Xin reminded that when looking for intermediary companies, we must pay attention to whether they are professional companies.
32年时光里谁在孤独战斗他们将中国男篮伤口抚平新浪体育讯　北京时间9月1日，中国队苦战四节不敌波多黎各，不过易建联在内线依旧强势的发挥，还是让球迷看到了新男篮的希望。巧合的是，不管胜负，中国队每次遇到波多黎各，明星内线们都有华丽的数据，他们也成为男篮对抗波多黎各最大的亮点。阿联第一场面对希腊，砍下26分和14个篮板，次战科特迪瓦26分9篮板，再算上今天的24+7，三场比赛过后阿联的场均数据为25.3分和10个篮板——这是中国队中唯一的一个20+10的数据，也是整个世锦赛所有球员中唯一的一个20+10。在本次世锦赛的数据榜上，场均篮板数能到达两位数只有两个球员，一个是伊朗队的哈达迪(场均10.3个)，而另一个就是中国队的易建联，两人之间的差距只有0.3个，但是阿联在得分榜上却遥遥领先于哈达迪，场均25.3分的数据可以排在第三位，但是得分和篮板球上20+10的数据却只有他一个。4年前，姚明火力全开，以25.3分砍下世锦赛得分王。当时中国队也遇到了波多黎各，姚明在31分钟上场时间里拿到29分8篮板，比赛虽然输了，但姚明在内线给拉莫斯和圣地亚哥制造的麻烦，时至今日我们仍记忆犹新。当时给姚明最强支援的是朱芳雨和王仕鹏，两人分别拿下18分和13分。最周3分的差距，中国队饮恨日本。24年前，西班牙世锦赛，中国在C组与波多黎各相遇，这也是中国队在国际大赛中唯一一次击败对手。宋涛砍下全场最高的24分，王非和李亚光分别拿下16分和15分，而波多黎各手感不佳最后输给中国14分。32年前，中国队在马尼拉与波多黎各在B组相遇，下半场中国队虽然净胜15分，无奈上半场落后太多，最终也是3分惜败。当时张卫平拿下全队最高的28分，成为中国内线抗波的第一利器。从张卫平、宋涛、姚明到今天的易建联，中国男篮一代代内线筑起守护的长城。只不过，32年过去，我们的内线优势还是优势，但外线呢？也许还要过很久，中国男篮才能找到真正可以和世界顶级控卫抗衡的球员吧。(田黄)	王,朱芳雨,拉莫斯,哈达迪,田黄,王非,张卫平,李亚光,姚明,仕鹏,阿联,易建联,宋涛	正向	Who has been fighting alone for 32 years? They have healed the wounds of the Chinese men's basketball team. Sina Sports News On September 1, Beijing time, the Chinese team lost to Puerto Rico in four hard quarters. However, Yi Jianlian's strong performance in the interior still let fans see the hope of the new men's basketball team. Coincidentally, whenever the Chinese team meets Puerto Rico, the star insiders have gorgeous data, and they also become the biggest highlight of the men's basketball team against Puerto Rico. The League of Arab States scored 26 points and 14 rebounds in the first game against Greece, 26 points and 9 rebounds in the second game against Cote d'Ivoire, and today's 24+7. After three games, the average score of the League of Arab States was 25.3 points and 10 rebounds - the only 20+10 figure of the Chinese team, and the only 20+10 figure of all players in the entire World Championships. In the data list of this World Championships, there are only two players whose average rebounds can reach double figures. One is Hadadi of Iran (10.3 per game), and the other is Yi Jianlian of China. The gap between the two is only 0.3. However, the Arab League is far ahead of Hadadi in the scoring list. The average rebounds of 25.3 points per game can rank third, but he is the only one with 20+10 scores and rebounds. Four years ago, Yao Ming opened his fire and scored 25.3 points, the world championship scoring champion. At that time, the Chinese team also met Puerto Rico. Yao Ming had 29 points and 8 rebounds in 31 minutes. Although the game lost, Yao Ming caused trouble to Ramos and Santiago in the interior, which is still fresh in our memory today. At that time, Zhu Fangyu and Wang Shipeng were the strongest supporters for Yao Ming, who scored 18 points and 13 points respectively. The gap of 3 points in the most week was that the Chinese team hated Japan. Twenty four years ago, at the Spanish World Championships, China met Puerto Rico in Group C, which was the only time that the Chinese team defeated its opponent in an international competition. Song Tao scored the highest 24 points, Wang Fei and Li Yaguang scored 16 points and 15 points respectively, while Puerto Rico lost 14 points to China due to poor hand feeling. Thirty two years ago, the Chinese team met Puerto Rico in Group B in Manila. In the second half, although the Chinese team scored a net victory of 15 points, they fell behind too much in the first half and lost by 3 points in the end. At that time, Zhang Weiping scored the highest 28 points in the team, becoming the first sharp weapon in China's internal defense against waves. From Zhang Weiping, Song Tao, Yao Ming to today's Yi Jianlian, the Chinese men's basketball team has built a great wall of internal defense for generations. However, 32 years later, our internal advantage is still our advantage, but what about the external advantage? It may be a long time before the Chinese men's basketball team can find players who can compete with the world's top point guards. (Tian Huang)

Jamil Nielsen had 21 points and 5 assists, Rashad Lewis had 18 points, 8 rebounds and 5 assists, and Dwight Howard had 13 points and 9 rebounds. Hedo Turkoglu was absent. Yao Ming and Howard are the two most outstanding centers in the league, and the question of who is the first has always been a hot topic of discussion. However, today's contest between the two has not been able to get to the point. Howard was in foul trouble soon after he was present, and ""Warcraft"" was in prison. The Rockets were in excellent condition after the opening game. McGrady hit a three-point shot as soon as he came on. The first two three-point shots were not missed. The Rockets started 8-1. The Magic took nearly 3 minutes in the first quarter to make their first shot, but Yao Ming began to play hard. He first made a hook shot, and then made two consecutive jump shots. Yao Ming also caused Howard to foul and hit two free throws. After one man scored eight points for the Rockets, the Rockets took a 14-8 lead. Howard fouled twice five minutes later in the first quarter and had to take a rest. The Rockets took the opportunity to open the score, once leading by 10 points, and ended the first quarter 25-17. Howard scored three points with a free throw at the beginning of the second quarter, and Tony Betty and JJ Reddick also scored one after another. When Lewis hit a three point shot with 7:35 seconds left in the quarter, the Magic were only one point behind by 33-34. The second team of the Rockets failed to keep the lead. After Yao Ming and Tracy McGrady returned to the court, their status improved. However, Magic found a feeling in the outside and made frequent long shots. Before the end of this section, Nielsen made a successful mid shot, and the Magic overcame with 53-51. Yao Ming performed well in the first half, scoring 16 points and 7 rebounds. 40 seconds after the beginning of the third quarter, Howard was called the fourth foul, but the Magic continued to keep him on the court. Yao Ming had three fouls in a minute and had to sit on the sidelines. The Magic took the chance to exceed the score, and they were 68-67 ahead with 2:26 left in this section. The small team of the Rockets performed well. Alston and Landry broke through the layup one after another and scored. The Rockets led 73-69 with one minute left in this section. At the end of the half court, the Rockets had a slight advantage of 73-71. With 6:13 left in the game, Howard regained his face on Yao Ming. After he turned around under the basket, Yao Ming was fouled. Both fouls were four times. After Howard made two free throws and one hit, the two sides fought 83-83. At the critical moment, Artest hit three points, and the Rockets exceeded the score again. Although Yao Ming committed four fouls on his back, he performed well. With 4:45 left in this quarter, Yao Ming scored a layup and the Rockets were 90-85 ahead. After Lewis scored another three points, Yao Ming scored again under the basket, grabbed the offensive rebound, and then made up the basket to score. With 3:33 left in the game, Artest hit a mid-range shot, and the Rockets opened the score slightly with 94-88. Yao Ming made mistakes after that, but he successfully prevented Howard's attack. After the Rockets missed consecutive shots, with 1 minute and 52 seconds left in this section, Yao Ming turned around to shoot and hit the ball after shaking under the basket, and the Rockets stabilized their position with 96-90. After the Magic narrowed the gap to 5 points, they missed shots in a row. With 23.1 seconds left in the game, after the Rockets grabbed the rebounds, the Magic could only foul, Alston made one of two free throws, and the Rockets led by 6 points to lock the victory."

76人四处撒网积极寻求交易布兰德尚在建队计划中新浪体育讯　北京时间6月20日消息，据费城76人官网报道，将萨缪尔-戴勒姆波特送到萨克拉门托国王仅过了一天，费城76人总经理艾德-斯特凡斯基便称会继续出击寻求交易。“在球队度过一个仅取得27场胜利的赛季后，我们肯定要积极进取，”斯特凡斯基说，“我们会看看能否继续交易，没错，我们必须得更加积极主动。”球队已经将牢骚满腹的中锋戴勒姆波特送到国王，换来了安迪斯-诺西奥尼和斯宾塞-霍伊斯。斯特凡斯基并没有指出接下来将要交易哪名球员。“我们没有明确需要补强的位置或一定要得到哪些球员，只是四处打听，看能否换来可以帮助球队提升战绩的球员，”斯特凡斯基说，“我们不会为了交易而交易。”从目前情况来看，76人并不打算送走高薪低能的埃尔顿-布兰德。76人承认送走戴勒姆波特对球队在篮板和封盖方面造成了一定损失。但是，新任主教练道格-科林斯说这笔交易能让球队前场更有活力，埃尔顿-布兰德将直接受益。“之前我一直觉得布兰德只能打中锋，因为他和戴勒姆波特并不兼容，”科林斯说，“现在，我感觉布兰德和霍伊斯的组合应该不错，而且他还能和斯贝茨搭档，现在我的选择灵活多了。”(草头王)	斯贝茨,布兰德,戴勒姆波特,安迪斯-诺西奥尼,科林斯,斯宾塞-霍伊斯,斯特凡斯基,埃尔顿-布兰德,草头王,霍伊斯,道格-科林斯,萨缪尔-戴勒姆波特,艾德-斯特凡斯基	正向	"The 76ers spread their nets around to actively seek a deal. Brands is building a team. Sina Sports News reported on June 20, Beijing time. According to the official website of the Philadelphia 76ers, it was only one day after Samuel Dailemport was sent to Sacramento King. Ed Stefanski, the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers, said he would continue to attack for a deal. ""After the team had a season of only 27 victories, we must be aggressive,"" said Stefanski. ""We will see if we can continue to trade, yes, we must be more proactive."" The team has sent the complaining center Dailem Porter to King, in exchange for Andes Nocioni and Spencer Hoyce. Stefanski did not indicate which player would be traded next. ""We didn't specify the position to be reinforced or the players we must get, but we just asked around to see if we could get the players who can help the team improve its performance,"" said Stefanski. ""We will not trade for the sake of trade."" From the current situation, the 76 people are not going to give away Elton Brand, who is highly paid but low skilled. The 76ers admitted that giving away Dailem Porter caused some losses to the team in rebounding and blocking. However, the new head coach Doug Collins said that the deal could make the team more energetic in the front court, and Elton Brand would benefit directly. ""Before, I always thought Brandt could only play in the center because he was not compatible with Darlemport,"" Collins said"
